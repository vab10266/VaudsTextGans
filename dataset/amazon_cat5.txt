I would recommend this for a travel magnifier for the occasional reading.I had read on another review about a magnifier having a problem with the light coming on. I did find that this one appeared to be DOA out of the box. But, after opening & shutting the viewer to turn on & off the light, the light began to come on. After several times of doing this, the light appears to be coming on all the time.It is small, but for taking it someplace & reading things like a menu in a dark corner of a restaurant, this is great.
These are lightweight and efficient and have some very good points:- the batteries last 2-3 months with daily use.- the LED is bright enough and adequately covers the whole magnified area under the 3X lens-- the lens itself is glass and good quality- the shell is plastic and it&#8217;s very light (but may not take a beating over time)-  it&#8217;s easy to open and turn on the light and the sliding mechanism has never failedI bought a six-pack of these from another vendor and all I can say is to shop around because prices vary tremendously.  I use this magnifier to inspect seeds and leaves.  I keep these magnifiers on my desk, in my briefcase, and in a backpack and I like them a lot.
Seems to be a legit 3X.  I bought my first and everything perfect.  So I bought a 2nd for my nephew - but that one had the light issue someone else mentioned (really dim, flickering).  Before I sent it back, I wanted to check the batteries - so I unscrewed where they are, took them out, but it looked like the contact on the right battery on the unit(uses 2 small watch-like ones) had some kind of grime on it - wiped that off, and I also bent the little tab to stick out a little more to give it a better contact on the battery - did that for the other side as well (it's different because of the +/- but you can bend both sides out a little).  After that, put the batteries back in and it works like my good one.
I'll admit it.  I fought like crazy when people started suggesting that I get a magnifying glass.  Yes, I could no longer some menu descriptions, especially in low light.  And when I needed to see the model number on an electronic device's sticker, and couldn't, well, that was a problem too.  After I accepted that I had a problem, I refused to get an old-fashioned magnifier, like my mother uses.  So, I looked around and this caught my eye (haha). I've been using it for a few weeks now and I love it.  It is black and sleek, and, yes gets the job done.  And, those low light environments?  No longer a problem, since this has a built in light that turns on when you slide open the magnifier.
I got two of these - one for my mom and one for my mother-in-law, both in their 80s.  What I wonder is why i didn't get one for me?  I will be wanting to order another for myself.  These were a big hit for these ladies and so useful.  As we age, we need more light to see what was once easy for us to read.  Often we are in areas where the lighting is poor or minimal.  This answers that need.  If you are looking for a product like this, try it.  It will meet your needs.
This is a great little portable magnifier with light.  I bought 2 of them so I could keep one in my purse and have one for my desk.  However, my husband liked the blue one so much he took off with one and now I need to re-order!It is slightly curved so it feels good in your grip.  Closed, it measures about as long as your standard full-sized desktop mouse and about a half inch thick.  The viewing glass area is about as big as the face/screen of a flip style cell phone.  When open it emits an impressively strong light that works like a champ in the darkest of rooms. As it is an LED light it should have a very long operating life as LEDs don't require a lot of power.  Presumably the battery could be changed if needed as there is a small door with a single screw located behind where the light is housed.  5 stars!
This magnifier has nothing to cover it when not in use.I compared it with a Carson 3x magnifier and this one did not seem as clear as the Carson - hard to see the furigana clearly in Japanese comic books with this one.The Carson ones come with a cover.I would recommend the Carson 5x if you are looking for good size enlarging.Carson MiniBrite 5x Power Slide- Out MagnifierI wish I had skipped the 3x and gone with the 5x only.For this one in the 3x, the light works well and lights things up nicely.Carson MiniBrite 5x Power Slide- Out Magnifier
purchased this for someone who has macular degeneration and she actually cried when she used it because she had not been able to read a newspaper for a couple years. Although I also bought her a small hand-held magnifier, this covers a large area so you don't have to continually move the magnifier back and forth across the page.This allows it to be of use for reading large pages such as a newspaper or a full menu, for example.The fact that it is rigid allows it to be held more easily without it bending as some do which causes blurring and distortion of the page.
This magnifier is convenient, in that it is in a container, so it prevents scratches on the glass, but it's a lot bulkier than I expected it to be. Also, you have to move the angle of the glass around or the lettering looks distorted at times, and I don't like the 6x magnifier at the bottom right corner of the lens - it's distracting. The LED light comes in extremely handy in the dark, and is nice and bright, but only on the side of the glass that the light is located. It does it's job, i guess, but not what I expected.
I bought this item for my husband to read small print as his eyesight was not good.  I borrowed it so many times, that I decided to get one for myself.  Both are used greatly on fine print on our prescription bottles any many other things where they insist on using small print on ingredients, etc. I design and sew  fashions and use it in my design studio every time I have to rip and resew a seam.  I always check with  Amazon when looking for an item.  The PRIME shipping saves a lot of money.
Real nice build to this razor. It's hard to beat the German quality. However, I believe this razor is not aggressive enough. I actually got a  better shave with my $12.00 Lord. I just don't get that close shave feeling, even after two passes. Maybe I should try a third pass, but I don't think it's going to matter. I've used both Feather and the Gillette 7 O'clock Sharp Edge blades. The new feather worked better this morning. I'll try it for a few days more and see how it goes.

ONE STAR:The Maxell LR44 10-pack photo shows the new hologram packaging, but I received the old orange & black packaging.The batteries are stale. Lights powered by them are semi-bright, and only last a day or so.The orange & black pack rates 1-star.FIVE STARS:From the same supplier, MyBatterySupplier, I ordered the50-pack, which did come in the new hologram package, and the difference was dramatic.  Lights powered by the batteries were brilliant, and I expect them to last much longer.The new hologram pack rates 5-stars.
This is a great price for batteries, you could pay a couple of bucks a retail store for only 1 or 2 when you can get 10 on Amazon!  These little LR44's are found in so many of my children's toys, the Thomas the Tank Engine cars that talk, Tinkerbell that glows, Christmas ornaments, even some little cheap twirling lights bought at the dollar store.  I have ordered these twice now, because something new dies and I find that it needs the same kind of battery.  It's definitely more economical to buy in this quantity than buying a couple at a time!  They also work well and last, too.  Stock up HERE!!
Bought 3 packs, prepared to live with a high percentage of bad ones considering that locally the same batteries are $3 each, but they are easy to check in the card and all were good.  Bought these in 2011 just used the last ones and came back to order more when I realized I hadn't reviewed them.  Very pleased.BTW, it is true that the description is misleading, the batteries I received are alkaline, not silver-oxide.  I will use only silver oxide in timekeeping devices, but for toys and flashlights, alkaline is a better value.
I've had a set of these batteries for a year or two now. The last few times I've taken them out for vacation use in camera, I've had the same problem: I charge two sets (one Kodak and one these Energizers) when I put the camera away. A few weeks later, I go off on vacation. The Kodak 1600mAh set will last me all day on the charge from a month or so before. The Energizer 2500mAh set might last me half a day, having lost most of its charge from sitting for the same number weeks before use.After missing out on some pics on my latest trip due to dead batteries, I'd had enough. The Energizers are going in the bin, and I just followed the good reviews to buy a set of Duracells to replace them.
In this day and age it is hard to understand why everyone isn't using rechargable batteries.  I own about 6 packs of these batteries.  They are wonderful.  I bet I have saved hundreds of dollars so far and keep saving.  Why pay $4.00 to $5.00 for one pack of batteries that get used once and thrown away when you can purchase these and reuse them 1000 times.  I absolutely refuse to by disposable batteries for the most part.  It is true that they don't quite have the power of normal energizer alkaline batteries so they might be an issue for certain things that use a lot of power.  For example Digital Camera's take a lot of power.  But for the most part these work really well and I have used them for 3 - 4 years now.  I highly recommend them to everyone.
I use my rechargable batteries for just about everything. Be it remote controls, cameras,and flashlights and I haven't noticed any rapid deteriorating of the batteries. Recharging takes about 12 hrs but I keep extra just in case. The only issue I have had is the price - it keeps going up. I've seen them priced as high as $12 for the 4 pack. I have also seen them as low as $7.99 at Menards they average about $9.99. If you decide to use rechargable batteries just make sure you have extra ones for when they run down.
I purchased 12 of these late last year.  After 4 months of low to medium use, they stopped holding their charge -- even when not placed in a device.  I lost several camera opportunities when I found that all the batteries in my camera bag were dead just days after being charged.I still use them but make sure to drop them in the charger a few hours before they're to be used.  It's better than just throwing them away.  Definitely not "Great for the environment" if you end up throwing them away within 6 months. :(
I have mixed feelings about these batteries.  They take a good charge and hold it better than my Duracell rechargebles, but still lose about 10% overnight.  I use them to power a one-LED night light outdoors.  It keeps it bright for at least three nights if I remember to turn it off during the day.  One of the four batteries is a little loosey-goosey.  Sometimes it only charges about 75%, though another recharge cycle will restore it to full again.  Considering other reviewers' comments about funky batteries, maybe they should tighten their quality control.
I have 4 kids and we were using batteries like crazy.  I don't necessarily like throwing all of those batteries away when there are rechargables.  I went to the store without doing any research first and just picked up these Energizers 2500mAhs.  Needless to say, most don't work after a year.  I couldn't get my programmable thermastat to even work because it had such a low charge coming straight off of the charger.  And today, my sons batteries died in his guitar, took the ones that had just gotten done in the charger and they didn't even last five minutes, and boy he wasn't very happy.  I think I would have been better off getting those junky ones from the dollar store.  Look for a better brand!
I originally got this for my daughter's leapfrog leap pad. She was going through batteries every couple of days, so rather than go broke buying batteries, I got these along with theEnergizer Value Charger with AA Rechargeable Batteries, 4 Batteries Included, which gives us a set to put in her leap pad, and a set to keep on the charger charged.  It charges well, and is always ready when I need to swap them out. It is definite woth the money, especially if you go through a lot of batteries.
I was going through quite a few batteries for my cats' toys: there's a chase-the-string toy, a chase-the-mouse-tail toy, and a whoo-hoo!-chase-the-laser dot toy.  Using the rechargeable batteries works well - I have an Energizer charger and two sets of 4 AAs to rotate, so they've always got something ready to pounce on!  I'm saving money and not throwing away so many batteries, and the cats don't notice the difference!
While these batteries have a higher mAh rating than other brands, I've seen much better performance from my Duracell and even some generic rechargeable batteries.  I cannot say for certain you'll have the same bad experience, as it depends what you use them for, but for me they barely seem to make it 2-3 months and sometimes only weeks before they lose too much charge to be of use.  They're nearly worthless to me.  I almost never use them anymore.I'm replacing these with Duracell ones that are advertised to hold their charge for a year, so hopefully those will work as promised.  I just cannot advise going with Energizer after using these.  Try another brand.
I'm a die hard geocacher - and the best AA batteries I can find for long life are the Energizer Lithium 9x batteries, but they are expensive and it bothers me to dispose of so many batteries (even recycled) in a year.  SO, I bought two sets of these and a charger and they work well.  Not great, but well.  I have to change batters in the outdoor GPS twice for a full day of caching whereas I could go all day on the Lithium 9x ones.  Sort of an inconvenience, but going green on anything seems to have it's convenience price tag...Good batteries.  Have the Rayovac rechargeable AA's as well and these seem to be a LITTLE longer lasting on a full charge.
I had this Interplak until for just over 1 year and it just stopped working for no apparent reason. The pump runs but no water flows. I checked the water path and it's completely clear. No blockages anywhere. The pump simply doesn't pump water anymore. I wouldn't get another because even when it did work the water jet was underpowered. The WaterPik brand has a more robust stream and is more effective. As other reviewers have pointed out, the pressure dial on the Interplak can be almost impossible to turn. There is a large array of attachments will for most people will simply be a cleaning nightmare since they'll never use them. So they just sit on top of the unit collecting dirt. Overall I'd rate this unit as "build quality: poor, life span: short, effectiveness: disappointing".
Duracell 9 volts are the only batteries I use in the wireless microphones we use for our instructional video business. We replace the batteries before every shoot and sometime run for up to 10 hours non-stop. Wireless microphones use a lot of power and we have found that the Duracell batteries can make it through an entire day of shooting, lasting about 25% longer than the less expensive generic types we tried before.We also use Duracell 9 volts in our smoke detectors at home. They might be more expensive than some, but they are worth it in the long run.Highly recommended!
Although I'm sure my local fire department will cringe if they read this, I buy these things for our backups for our fire alarms and they last over 4 years!  Wow!  Now if I buy a knockoff brand, or even Energizer, I can only get 18 months out of them before they start squealing to be replaced.  Plus, this 8 battery pack makes it awfully simple to have them around when it comes time to change them, and it's the right number for my house.  Love these Duracells!  Highly, highly recommend!
You want a battery that is going to last, then you can't go wrong with this one. I bought the 8 count because my garbage can needs 4 and the shelf life of these batteries is so good that I have no doubt it will provide me with the many months of use. Since I have the first 4 still being used, going on 7 months now, I am going to guess at least 1 year before I will need to replace so yes, a good purchase price for this 8 pack.
For most people, that's what you will need these for.  And once that stupid thing starts beeping at 3 AM (I swear its programmed in that way by some sadist at Big Smoke Detector), you are going to want to have a 9 volt ready.  Because you are not the kind of monster who would let your family burn to death (well probably smoke to death if we are honest) cause you were too cheap or lazy to replace the battery.  That's not how you want to get on the local news (that or &#34;local cat hoarder in Guinness Book of World Records&#34;).Given that these have the &#34;Durablock&#34; feature they have a long guaranteed shelf life, so feel free to splurge on this 4 pack of 9 volts.  You will be safe, and feel like a big spender.
Of all the batteries I use, I really dislike D size. They're heavy, and I understand that they have to be. So the question was, do I want to spend a small fortune on rechargeable D's or get the tried an true Duracell D. You know the answer. I use these in one huge flashlight and in two motion sensor lights on our house. I can't tell you that these are better than the bunny batteries, but from my experience, these just keep going, and going, and going. Since the motion sensors are used on a nightly basis (the sensors have picked up raccoons, skunks, and opossums which we didn't even know we had in suburbia), I think it's amazing that we haven't had to replace the batteries yet, and the light is still as strong as ever.
I've used Duracell batteries for years, and they've always been reliable. I would like to mention two things that stood out with the most recent D-cell Duracells (8-count package) that I bought in the 8-pack:* The expiration date is December 2023, more than ten years after I purchased them.* The packaging is some of the best that I've seen for batteries, and if you don't need all eight of them now, the packaging also serves as a nice, resealable container. Also, it was extremely easy to open, needing only a small pair of scissors to cut where indicated.I also recently purchased an 8-count package of Duracell C-cells. The same comments apply, except that the packaging is different (cardboard instead of plastic) than the packaging the D-cells came in, and the expiration date is only nine years out.Call me a very satisfied customer.
Best Deals sells outdated batteries. All the batteries had an expiration date of 09/2011 on them. Also they were not in Duracell packaging as the website picture shows. Makes one wonder if they bought a huge bunch of outdated batteries and are now trying to rip off buyers. Best Deals has a history of doing this if you read back in feedback on this company. Whish I had read back and I wouldn't have ordered from them. They also never replied to my emails.  I filed an A-Z guarantee claim with Amazon.  Amazon has also referred this seller to their investigation unit. It is a shame a seller like this tarnishes the excellant reputation Amazon has. No wonder the batteries were so cheap.
This is just a battery right? (Duracell Coppertop with Duralock)The D cells I received from Amazon have a expiration date on the battery Dec 2022. Bought these Dec 2012, so I get 10years. See photo in customer photo section.Great to see expiration date on battery!!  NO MORE GUESSING if they're too old.My D cells came in a plastic box suitable for storage.Price here on Amazon for 8 D cell was much lower than any retail outlet.Good price, fresh batteries. 5 starsShips from and Sold by Amazon
Duracell batteries are my favorite for reliability and endurance.  In my opinion, they provide more continuous output than any other competitor battery. The chief competitor, Energizer, does not last as long in my appliances than does the Duracell.  So, when I buy batteries, I buy Duracell.  This said, be aware of the following facts:  Duracell's cost slightly more than Energizers, so perhaps the Energizers are more economical in the long-run.  Second, always check the expiration date on the batteries.  If the expiration date is near, return them and ask for the package with the  longest expiration date.  Finally, store batteries in the refrigerator for longest storage life.  Shelf life at room temperature depletes all batteries.kone
Needed to purchase these to power a portable fan. Came well packaged with no damage (from Amazon proper) and the expiration date was years in advance.  Batteries performed as expected, pricing a bit more than 3 hours of continuous power to a portable fan set on &#8220;high&#8221;......  Basically, these are very expensive to use and other types of batteries (re: rechargeable) would be a better purchase although there are just times when only a &#8220;D&#8221; Cell will do.As long as there is no visible damage and your exp. date is ok, these Duracell Alkaline Coppertops should perform well. I have never had any trouble with them over the years.
Ignore the positive reviews for these batteries folks.  Better you should trust the negative comments and save yourself the hassle of returning dead batteries.  I should have known when they arrived that something was wrong:  They were shipped in a generic clamshell-type package with no label or indication they were made by Duracell - not at all as pictured and a red flag for fakes.  Note to seller:  How long did you think you'd get away with selling dead (and possibly fake) batteries?  Note to Amazon:  Please investigate this seller!
I purchased quite a few toys over Christmas that required batteries. Luckily Amazon has batteries at a low price in large bulk to cover my needs.The batteries show up in Amazons no frills frustration free packaging with an expiration date several days out. Other individuals, unfortunately, have received batteries near or past their expiration date as well as less than acceptable packaging. I would do two things:1) Make sure when you are ordering the batteries that you are ordering from amazon itself and not one of the other vendors that may pop up replacing amazon.2) When you receive the batteries make sure you check the expiration date of the batteries and, if you have a volt checker, test the batteries.Overall a good deal on a wide variety of sizes and quantities.
Came in neat factory pack marked Durablock*that doubles as storage case also.......Says 10 yrs Guaranteed....... Exp date shows as Dec. 2022 ....... Ordered for a small indoor Coleman Lantern that takes four & [2] O2 Cool portable fans that take 2 each.http://www.amazon.com/O2-Cool-Portable-Battery-Operated-Fan/dp/B001AVMSEY/ref=cm_cr-mr-titleAll into an Emergency supply kit in case we ever have a nasty power outage as happened the 1st week of July here in SW Va.......... temps in the 100's ........ Soon that kit will be turned into a coffee or end table....... using large black metal dog cage .. No point in hiding emergency supplies away -
I didn't order these because so many things seemed fishy about their presentation on Amazon. The Duracell photos were all different--none of them D batteries in a package of eight. On the product description page, it looked like AA batteries were shown in the image. When I read reviews, many buyers received their batteries unpackaged, just thrown in a box. Others received them in individual bags. A few years ago, I discovered that rip-off batteries are commonly sold on the internet--not the brands they say they are, but fakes.SOOO...no thanks. I'll go with Ray-O-Vac this time.
I buy 2 packs of these EVERY MONTH for work. We use them for a digital scale built into our forklifts. This is in use 8 hours a day, 5 days a week... standard 40 hours. I get them with Subscribe & Save. I don't think you can possibly get similar quality for the price, and rechargeable D Batteries!? Yea right!! With the risk of damaging the batteries here, I don't think so. Not for that price. Duracell is the way to go!
We have been using Duracell for many years, and have always trusted our camping and emergency needs and devices we use to being powered by them, in one form or another.  Sure there are cheaper batteries out there, rechargeable even and solar too; and of course Duracell has their versions of all of these.We do believe in being green, and doing the best to keep our energy footprint small, and we have found over the years we can count on the Copper top for most of our needs.  And of course we should all dispose of them properly.
Duracell Coppertop Duralock D batteries are premium quality batteries, as reflected in their price.  They seem to last longer than every other kind of battery I have purchased.  Although I haven't actually done any laboratory testing, they have been in a particular flashlight I have and have been in there working for about 10 years.  In a crisis or long duration power failure event, these are my first choice for survival.If you are looking for the best battery on the market, I think these are it.
In general, Duracell and Enrrgizer perform significantly better than more generic battrries in terms of battery life. Yhese are no exception. I used them in a stompbox, and even though this is primsrily for practice and jamming, i don't want interruptions to change the batteries. These don't disappoint.The pricing of Duracell on Amazon has also been much better than I can get locally. Before I bought these, I tried three drugstores and one supermarket to see ifIi could pick up a better deal. It wasn't possible. The batteries I could find locally were runnng almost twice as much as these Duracells on Amazon. As long ss that remains the case, I will continue to buy online.
A Christmas gift for 2 young boys who love to wander thru the woods near their house at night.  They have found goblins, trolls, werewolves, and lions, tigers, and bears....(if you wish to believe their tales!)  They are small in size but very, very bright and the light projects for a great distance.  We can sit on our back porch and tell about where they are by watching the light beam in the trees.They now also turn our couches upside down to make a tent and use their lights to read and play by.  They do that even in the daylight!  The batteries have not yet been replaced after many hours of use.  They made a great gift and got them away from the TV and computer games.  That is the biggest benefit in my opinion.
I have had several maglites over the years and while reading the reviews decided to get this light because it is LED. WRONG, for some reason most of the reviews are on the LED version and this light is the battery eating krypton version.I have drawers full of these old ones and don't use them because they are just old inefficient technology.I was bummed out and requested a refund and planned to refuse the fedex shipment. But when I cancelled the order they said to just keep it. I really don't wont the damned thing but I think it would cost them more if I now refuse the package.Moral quandary.Maybe I'll upgrade it with the LED kit.UPDATE####################I bumped it up a star because it is now perfect since I added the L.E.D. mod kit by Nite-ize.It now has 25 hour battery life and is twice as bright.
I've dropped my Maglite onto hard floors, submerged it in water, and subjected it to the abuses of a tornadic four year old. The all metal (not plastic!) case is nearly indestructible. Both ends are threaded and are fitted with snug o-rings to protect the innards from rain, humidity, and submersion. The lens housing twists to adjust the focus of the beam and comes off to allow it to be used as a candle (handy for nights in a tent or during a power outage). In addition, an extra bulb resides in the base!
Do NOT buy a Maglite product unless it's an LED light. Non-LED Maglite products are crap and do not have any usefulness in modern society. LEDs are the wave of the future and yet Maglite is still producing these style of flashlights. When I got the flashlight and turned it on for the first time, I could not believe how dim the light was. It's barely 10 lumens, if that. Do NOT waste your money on this product. Buy a pen light such as a Streamlight Pro or something of that nature that will accept AA's but can output over 50 lumens of light energy. Much more cost effective, lighter, more efficient and overall a better product. I'm sure Maglite is producing LED lights so if you do get one it will most likely be a good flashlight just do not get this particular style.
I was taking part in a filmmaking seminar in Maine, and everyone had two tools: a Mini Maglite and aLeatherman.  They all wore them on their belts, and they came in handy on numerous occasions.  Of course I picked one up and I love the little holster that comes with it.  If it didn't look dorky I'd probably wear this and a multi-tool all the time.It's not just good for night use.  Changing a fuse, adjusting equipment, finding something under the desk.  For those kinds of everyday, all-the-time uses, the Mini Mag is much more handy and useful than the largerMAGLITE, which I also own and keep in my closet for emergencies and camping.  Highly recommended for its simplicity, utility, and durability.
Product arrived on time with all parts as advertised.Included belt loop holster is open ended, however itis easy enough to sew on a cover or button snap strap,add velcro, one column molle, whatever.Body has weave surface grip and tail cap lanyard hole.Popped in the included AA batteries and lit her up.Focus function  A-OKCandle mode  A-OKDrop test 3x at 3 meters  A-OKUnder water 15 minutes  A-OKOne handed operation  A-OK (if you're strong enough)Typical Maglite product.Inexpensive ($10 or so, duh) American made flashlightas opposed to some Chi-Com piece of shit.I like it and so will you.
We have been buying these Maglite Mini flashlights for quite a while. I have yet to try their LED version, but for now these work perfectly for me. I know that the LED one is supposedly much better, but at this price point, I have a very hard time passing these up.We probably must have about 3 or 4 of these around our home, and I personally keep 1 in every toolbag or toolbox. With the cheap price of these you can have one in every room and anywhere else you can think of. You also have a wide variety of colors to choose from, but I stick to the modest, classic black annodized.I know that this is just a review for a simple flashlight, but I believe Maglite to be the best, and I hope this review helps.
focus-able beam is nice. I had already bought a TeraLUX ministar2 extreme upgrade for my existing mag and liked it so much I decided to buy this to put it in a less scratched up case. for a conventional bulb the stock bulb is not very bright and unless you have a led module for it already or know enough about electronics to make one I would buy the mini mag LED. If you do know enough about electronics you can buy led lights, cut the leads and add your own heat sink for fairly cheap from parts here on amazon, I did this to my old mini mag (you can find instructions on instructables) and not as bright as the TeraLUX but 2-3 times brighter than stock for $2 in parts.
I have been a fan of Maglite as long as I can remember. I don't want a flashlight that breaks easily because when I need it, I NEED IT. The Maglite line has alway been durable and solid and feels good in the hand. The design is well thought out like the "candle mode" to light a space.This package has a nice holster, but it is small enough to fit easily in most pockets. Over the years I never had to replace the halogen bulb in a maglite but they typicall provide one spare in the bottom just in case. That kind of thoughtful reliablity plus nice design make this as great as the bigger ones.There are two of these in my house plus a LED model too. In my opinion this mini-maglite does everything I need very reliably. I can depend on it when it counts.Hope this helps someone.
mini lite was just the right size for me to use when I am fixing or repairing something and need a different size of light rays to see something tiny or in detail.  The size of the barrel of the flashlight is great for my hands when I need both of them to use and can just use my fingers to grasp instead of the whole hand.  Brightness of bulb is excellent since you can adjust the rays to be full or small to see just the focus of something detail.  Light also came with an upholster to store and wear on your body so you can carry for camping use or hiking use or even for your work when needed.  It is convenient to have in a holder so you don't have to hand carry it.  Great product for the price you pay.
This big pack was a huge problem solver for us.  We don't have a car so we navigate the shopping chores carefully.  We are within walking distance of many different stores and we do have a hardware store nearby but the usual purchase of a regular box was used quickly which meant constantly walking to the hardware store for refills.  Buying these has been a big relief for me, since I do most of the walking.  I am still using these and it has been MONTHS.  I will do this every time. The price is not painful and the large number of bags makes it a real deal.
We use these bags in two of our trashcans in the kitchens.  We have a kitchen on the main floor and in the basement and these 13 gallon bags are just the right size for our kitchen trash containers.  By the end of the week they are pretty full and we dump some smaller trash cans into the sacks as there is still room and then they are full to the top.  I have never had one leak or tear on me and I like the tie flaps to close the bag securely and to carry it outside.This is a good product and we will continue to use it and I recommend it to you.  The price here is high compared to what we are paying and you might want to shop around.
I'm clueless as to whom these trashbags are marketed. I bought them and find them pretty annoying. For one thing they DO NOT 'stretch and grab' as the marketing info says. They just hang there. If you want grabbing, try Hefties &#34;Hefty Gripper Tall, 13 Gallon Kitchen Bags). They're awesome.The other thing Easy-Flaps don't do is hold as much garbage as other Tall Kitchen bags. Because of their construction they barely fit our can, plus unless you under-fill them, there is not way to tie them off.The only good point about these bags is that they are 1 mil plastic. Otherwise they fall far short of what's needed in the kitchen.
I am the dishwasher in my home, and I like good tools. It's been a slog to find a truly good dish brush, and here it is. I used the amazon.com info and went to Ace and found the same brush sold individually. Bought one, and have been using it now for two months. It cleans very well, is easy to keep from getting clogged, and it doesn't splay out bristles very much. I've trimmed off about half a dozen bristles all in all, and the brush still has a lot of life left in it. The UPC at Ace for the individual brush is 0 4130104554 3. I like this brush enough to think that I'll buy the dozen-pack when this one gets too far gone. Washing dishes with a good brush makes a lot of difference.
We're not much pleased with this brush. It's way smaller than we wanted and, owing to the angle of the head, one has to get their hand in much closer in to the grubby dish or pot they're scrubbing. That makes it hard to apply much force. We bought another brush in the same order, the Libman Kitchen Brush which Amazon also sells and which is a mite cheaper. It's a far better brush, bigger and better designed. This one is ok but not good enough to recommend.
Review for: Rubbermaid Dish BrushA review for the humble dish brush.  I'm not sure what it is about this one but I prefer doing dishes with it more than the many other kitchen dish brushes I've tried from various retail stores and supermarkets.  I'll gladly waste time looking for this one buried in the sink before using another one just sitting there looking at me longingly.Like a car that lets you still feel the road, the bristles are flexible and unbunched enough you can get hard pressure right into the problem spots.  Flip it around and you get nice scraping action.  Use it with your hand close to the brush to get control as you target the corners and tough spots.This same flexibility means it won't look like new pretty fast compared to the ones with stiff bunched up bristles, however even scrunched up it still continues to work great.  So hats off to this simple, classic rubbermaid dish brush standing the test of time.
I used these when I went on a month long safari. Had no chance of resupply and did not want to take too many standard batteries as I found in my experience that the high humidity, despite being in a tight container, drained most of the charge before I used them. Took two sets of these lithium AA plus other brands as backup. Didn't need them as the one set in my camera and one set in my recorder were still working good after I had returned. They endured over 100F to a 32F at night, 90% humidity, heavy rain, damn mosquitoes (ah..wait..that was my gripe) and worked very well. Did not have a problem with having to wait for them to recharge my units like other cheaper brands.
The flat discharge curve of lithiums means they will stay above the UVLO (Under-Voltage Lock Out) conditions of your electronics power supplies. Today's electronics do not just keep working until all the juice is gone. They monitor the input voltage and when it drops too low to guarantee a stable output, they shut off. Normal batteries may still have some juice left in them but nothing other than flashlights can really make use of it. Lithiums go most of the way from full health to death in a relatively flat curve so your electronics will get longer life. Maybe only 10% to 15% wasted energy left when done compared to 40%+The price is worth it.
Even so, they last a long long time and the extra price is offset by the fact that you would be paying more to buy a comparable quantity of the other shorter-lived batteries.However, when they die, they DIE (I have found that they don't temporarily refresh themselves like the shorter-lived batteries do, when I turn off my camera and then turn it back on after a few minutes) -- so keep an extra pair (or however many you use in that specific device) on hand for the day the inevitable happens.And I believe that Lithium is more earth friendly -- and if I am not mistaken, these can be recycled????
We got a new point and shoot camera, and it was chewing up regular brand name AA's like they were going out of style.  Discovered these at the local big box store and decided to give them a try.  Wow.  In the name of full disclosure, they cost more than a standard pack of batteries might.  But let's face it, you don't want the camera conking out prematurely at the championship soccer game or that once in a lifetime vacation.  I simply can't recommend these Lithium Energizers enough.
In an outside sensor for an indoors weather station, these batteries rock. I spent years with my outside weather readings coming and going before I read the manual and saw that they now suggest Lithium batteries. Stuck a pair of these dudes into the remote sensor and have not had a problem in cold weather. With the Duracells, and I love Duracells, I was always loosing my outside temperatures anywhere below 30 degrees (F). So far I have gotten to -4 (F) with no dropouts. Very nice.
These lithium batteries are great. They are long lasting, lightweight and work great in freezing temperatures. Their "BEST BY" date is often ten years or more. If you have a device in a fridge or freezer or outside where it gets cold/freezing, then these are very useful since alkaline batteries will often fail in cold temperatures. They are also useful for devices that are inconvenient to change batteries, like clocks or wireless outdoor temperature or motion sensors. If you're wealthy, then you might as well use these instead of alkaline or rechargeables, but because of the relatively high cost, I only use these for "special" applications. Otherwise I use alkalines or Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable batteries.
These batteries really let you drain every little bit out of them. Make sure you use them in the correct devices, as others mentioned. They worked great in a digital camera w/ flash. I tried to use them in a headlamp - and they didn't fair so well. However even after I thought they were dead, if you let them "sit" for a little while, you can come back and get a little more life out of them (few more shots/flash, light, etc). It was kind of funny how many times the camera would power off, and I'd let it sit for an hour and come back to find there was some juice back in them. If you have a high drain electronic device or you need longevity/cold temps in your battery - then definitely give these a try. However if you have more average/lower draw electronics, these may not seem to last as long and can be quite expensive comparatively to alkalines.
I got these batteries specifically for my wife's digital camera and have been pleased with their performance to this point. When I first tested them on my battery tester they pegged the needle with their power; I've never seen another battery do that.They've been in my wife's camera now for several weeks and I test them again before we take it out for use and each time they've showed a full charge which has surprised me. If anything develops noteworthey I'll update my review but so far they have exceeded my expectations.
We have sensors for temperature and humidity in our attic.  We found that regular batteries do not work well in the cold of Maine winters. Buy these Lithium batteries has made a huge difference. The extra cost is absorbed by their longevity.Here's my TIP on those attic sensors or transmitters: TIP: I did find it best to purchase and use &#34;Energizer Ultimate Lithium&#34; AA cells. Not only do these last longer but are not really affected by the hot or freezing temperatures found in attics (and you don't need to climb up there to replace batteries every couple of months).
I bought these batteries thinking they where rechargable, but they aren't!These batteries lasted a very long time, I would say about 4-6x longer than my rechargeable batteries, in my ebook reader.Pro's:Long enduranceHigh power outputExcellent for both high power devices (like digital camera's or flash) as low power devices (clock or ebook reader).Cons:Non-rechargableDon't last as long as they mention on the package (4-6x not 8x longer than rechargeables, and about 2x longer than Duracell batteries)Conclusion:I would never buy these batteries for the sole reason that they are non rechargable.Otherwise they are excellent for small electronic devices like clocks and small portable radio's and ebook readers.For high power devices, though these batteries are excellent, I would especially recommend to get rechargeables!
Bought these for some trail cameras taking videos, with sound, field scan etc.  Are holding up well (better than new Alkaline)  and the price was great. They also have a listed Shelf Life of 15 years, and are supposed to last 9 times longer than Alkaline batteries with high drain applications. I recommend the product and the seller Brooklyn Battery Works.  Purchased some more of these from Mel Pierce Camera (an actual store but on Amazon too)  at a cheaper price and they were delivered fast. Reason I mentioned the sellers is due to what appears to be some scammers selling them . Both these sellers are fine, fast, priced fair, new in the package.
Generally, I have many positive experiences on Amazon with the exception of this vendor. Please let me explain; I received these batteries and noticed that they had an expiration date of 2027. Wow! I was "pleasantly surprised" for the long shelf life. I then placed the batteries in my drive way alarm and noticed that my drive-way alarm did not work properly. I immediately thought that I had a defective drive-way alarm. However, I decided to check the volts of these batteries with my multimeter and was quickly surprised that 5 batteries out of 8 were defective and actually was only producing less that 1 volt. They should be 1.5 volts. After contacting the vendor, they had me send the batteries back for testing which I had to pay for. Since then, I have not heard hide nor hair from this company. They will not communicate with me. That's wrong! Do yourself a favor and purchase these somewhere else....
Hopefully these perform as described. They are exactly what I need, but who can tell until they run down how long they will work? While I was away from my Home this winter, the alkaline batteries in my programmable thermostat died and did not turn on my heating system. I barely missed getting frozen pipes. If they perform as described they will be cheap insurance for repeating this problem, but I don't know if they will work for even 10 years, but certainly I can count on a couple of years from them, fingers crossed.
They are used in an Acurite weather station that we purchased.  The weather station has an outdoor sender that it mounted on our patio.  During the coldest parts of the year, the temperature on the patio can be in the teens.  Acurite, in the manual that comes with the weather station, recommends that lithium batteries be used in the outdoor sensor.As recommended by Acurite, we used the lithium batteries in the outdoor sensor.  We purchased these batteries about a year ago.  So far, the batteries have performed flawlessly.  We haven't yet had to replace the batteries in the sensor so I can't comment on their life, except to say that it's at least a year, at least for our type of use.
These are expensive for daily use, I'd recommend NiMH rechargeables for that, but they're perfect for low temperature use (car flashlight in Minnesota winter, digital camera use outdoors in the winter) when both alkalines and NiMHs fail to deliver. These would also be, with very gradual storage loss, great for an emergency electronic device. Maybe for GPS or LED flashlight. Do check that your electronics are happy with these batteries installed. I've heard of both digital cameras and GPS units (Garmin GPS60) that did not.
There are a lot of people that need more of a charge with electronics that only alkaline batteries cannot do, especially today's standard of electronics. Energizer has made that accomplishment with their Ultimate Lithium batteries. They work absolutely well in my hi-tech chargers for my Iphone and Ipod Touch, without the hassle of charging it to my computer all the time. They are simple to use and work great. I was pleasantly surprised at how good they can run, but when I tried them in my instant Energizer Charger, I was convinced that they were excellent at the power they have given me into my player. If you have a smartphone or a camera that needs more than alkaline batteries, I definitely recommend you give these a try from Energizer.Price: BCharging: B+Overall: B 1/2+
For almost everything in my household I use Sanyo eneloop rechargeable batteries, and could not be more pleased with them.  However, I recently purchase several LED emergency road flares, and wanted batteries which I wouldn't need to check frequently.  While the eneloops are also good for long term storage in the cold, they discharge faster when it is hot, and don't perform as well in the cold as these lithium batteries, which are rated down to -40F.  If you need these for more heavily used devices, you might want to get rechargeables, but these store well and operate in a wide range of temperatures.
I've just ordered a second supply of these batteries. The first set I used in a pair of salt and pepper grinders. The first thing I noticed is that they seemed to be more powerful than the Duracell batteries I was using before. They are still running strong after three month's of constant use. I would highly recommend Energizer Ultimate Lithimum batteries to anyone looking for the best, longest lasting battery. I am thouroughly satisfied with them.UPDATE: It's now been over four months and they are still going strong. I've purchased another pack of 8 just to keep them on hand when I need them. They have a 15 year shelf life so I'm not worried about them going bad over time.
I use these in my Canon DSLR flash attachment to get consistent, fast-recycling that simply can't compare to rechargeables or even standard alkalines.  They last a long time, retain power even when they're just sitting not being used, and provide excellent power for photo equipment.  These are worth the extra cost because they last way longer and maintain their high power throughout their life cycle.  I'll be continuing to use these for my camera equipment (though I'll use rechargeables for less critical devices like remote controls, Wii remotes, toys, etc.).
These batteries have a specific use: They are the navy seal or special ops of batteries. You don't want to use them in your every day juicing of low drain applications. They are for the knock down drag out applications that other batteries can only handle for minutes. Camera flashes.  Remote control cars. High drain applications where you need a battery that can go in and provide high power for a specific use.They're expensive, they're finely tuned to provide maximum output for maximum time on high drain activities. Don't waste them on remote controls, mice or smoke detectors.
I bought these for a digital camera which went through alkalines every 30 photos. After researching how alkalines drop to about 1.2 volts after very little use and then level out from there I learned that these lithiums maintain the 1,5 volts for a much longer period of use and consequently allow my camera to continue to work through about 120 to 150 photos. I also use these in the outside unit of my weather station because they will not fail at subzero temperatures like alkalines do. The added cost is worth it in some instances but probably not for general use.
These are "niche" batteries. They weigh half their Alkaline and NiMh brothers, store more energy, work in very low temperatures, and sit on the shelf for a decade without losing their charge.As everyday consumables they make no sense (for that, look into Eneloop rechargeables). But as the cells that power your emergency flashlight, your GPS on the Inka Trail, or your radio during a blackout, they are a godsend.Note that the voltage of these cells is slightly higher than regular AA's. Therefore, some devices actually *won't work*, at least not when the cells are fresh and fully charged! For example, people have posted problems with Garmin's Gpsmap 60csx or some regulated LED flashlights. I'd recommend you check with the manufacturer and test your device with those cells before placing them in your survival kit.
got 'em quick with no problems. yes they absolutely last longer [I use them in a lable maker]. These are great batteries but are not for every app. I do not recommend using the 9v version in a smoke detector. The lithium bateries by nature go until they are completely exausted then suddenly they are completely spent wih no warning. The alkilne batteries slowly get weaker thus letting the detector let out those annoying squeeks which tell you the detector's batteries need changing. Not to keen of a flashlite blinking out with no warning. But, the tremendious shelf life and longer runs between changes is a real plus.PS Check to see that you are getting the correct ones for your needs. They have different life spands of lasting 4,5,8 and the ultimate of 9 times longer than alkiline batts.
I bought these batteries specifically to go in the outdoor portion of my indoor-outdoor weather monitoring station. I tried normal alkaline batteries first, but they do not provide enough voltage when the temperature is low. Then I tried NiMH rechargeables, but those crap out at an even higher temperature. Then I coughed up the extra money for lithium, i.e. these batteries.These batteries are the only ones that work when it is very cold outside. Lithium wins!These are approximately the cheapest lithium batteries on Amazon, that is how I chose them. And they are a name brand. Go figure.
i was uneducated in lithium batteries. i thought they were rechargeable. but have come to get info from energizer via their telephone rep..that only lithium ion batteries are rechargeable...that lithium batteries as these are NOT.to me then, the price value is just not there. for the price paid for these i can buy around 36 good alkaline cells.update: i have found these batteries to not last as long as regular alkaline batteries....e.g. i get about 6 months use on a clock from an alkaline but only two months on these lithiums....obviously then i will stick with alkaline over these....i have tho moved to using rechargeable cells for nearly everything anymore- usually the enelop from sanyo- these are very good and certainly cost effective...
I ordered this scrub brush with the intent of using it on sinks and showers. I first used it when I threw my microfiber couch cushions in the laundry and they came out stiff. I used this brush to easily bring back the softness that microfiber is known for.Since then I have used it for sinks, tile, shower, and linoleum. It has worked fabulously each and every time and it is now my go to scrub brush. It is extremely comfortable in my hand, they did a fantastic job with the ergonomics. It is easy to apply gentle or firm pressure based on the situation.If you need a versatile brush that works well and is comfortable in your hand, this is it.
When it comes to this type of product I always go for the OXO brand first because I haven't bought one yet where I do not like the grip. They, by far, have the most comfortable grips than any other brand I've tried and this one is no different. I like how small the brush itself is and how easy it is to use it for long periods of time without my hand hurting. I've been using it regularly for four months now and it is starting to show wear and tear but you know what? It's inexpensive and I like it so much, I don't mind having to buy a new one. This time, I think I'll get two :)
I expect a scrub brush to be designed for medium/heavy pressure.  The shape of the handle in my hand doesn't allow me to just press down and do the job.  Rather, the roundness of the handle wobbles back and forth (left to right versus back and forth) in my palm.  Also when wet the handle doesn't feel solid in my palm.  Maybe it's just the shape of my hand instead of a design flaw?  I only deducted one star for this possibility.The bristles are high quality and the plastic piece appears of the OXO quality you'd expect.
I bought this a couple weeks ago to use to scrub up some stains out of our carpet and it has worked wonderfully. And while the bristles are delicate enough to not destroy a carpet, they are also robust enough to use to scrub a shower, sink or tub - I've used it for all of these. This is a bit more expensive than other bargain scrub brushes you might find, but the ergonomic grip really is worth it. If you are going to be using this for any extended period of time, your hands and wrist will feel the difference.
I have always kept a hefty scrub brush around for I have an old kitty that loves to toss up her dinner occasionally, plus a young puppy that often feels left out and follows suit.  Scrub brushes are easy to find and probably never considered here much on Amazon.  But trust me when I tell you that not only is this a terrific brush, but it is also very hard to find in stores.  The power behind this baby is its contoured plum like handle that sits directly on top.  It gives you maximum comfort for your hand while directing the brushes where you want without you getting tired and the brushes just slipping lightly over the stain.  The handle and the brushes are of a great quality and and I bought two for different parts of the house.  Definitely a vast improvement over the usual handles we all are used to seeing on brushes like this, and at a very fair price here on Amazon. The best, and highly recommended...
After reading the reviews, and recognizing the quality of OXO, I thought I had made a good decision. I was in for a surprise. I have one of those old tubs with some soap build up that is difficult to remove. With a little elbow grease, and with this superb brush, the soap scum is gone. Good grief, what a surprise. For years I have been trying to get that stuff off.  I am now going to scrub my stair carpet. Somehow, coffee stains have ingrained themselves into the rug.The raised handle keeps my hands and fingers above the brush, which makes it so much easier to use your full force. Thecontoured handle gives me a strong grasp for vigorous cleaning. The handle is nonslip, wet or dry. It is great for cleaning a variety of surfaces, from tile to carpet. There are two types of bristles for the optimum scrub. I have never found anything better for scrubbing out those darn spots!Highly Recommended. prisrob 02-08-14
I just LOVE this brush.  Not only does it &#34;feel good&#34; to the hand, but it's design allows you to easily get into the rounded corners of the bathtub whereas a flat, rectangular shaped brush made rounded areas difficult to clean.  The non-slip rubber grip is a plus as well.  I'm really happy with this purchase.  Will buy again when I need a replacement.  Have been using it for over 10 months and it shows no signs of wear.  Very satisfied.
I had one of this brush already, but wanted another for outside. I use my inside one to clean tubs and shower tile mainly, and anything else that needs the work of its sturdy bristles. I use the outside one for dirty or mucky shoes, and to clean out our two flat, rectangular bird feeders that hang outside in the weather. If it rains or snows, the feeders get pretty nasty inside on the bottom, but we like them as they allow the birds, squirrels and chipmunks to all be able get into the trays to eat.
This bottle brush is great. We bought it for washing things like water bottles and glasses. It might be hard to see in the picture but the blue part of the brush sticks out a little and it more flat to help get all the corners of whatever you're cleaning. Also the grippy part is easy to hold on to and the neck of the brush is long enough for everything I've used it on. I'm always happy with OXO products and this one is no exception.I highly recommend this.
No kitchen should be without one of these.  This has replaced my two other dish and bottle scrubbers.  I now use this when washing dishes almost exclusively since it gets down into glasses and cleans the inside of them very easily.  I pop it into the dishwasher when I run it. It is flexible enough to get into anything but still sturdy enough to get the job done fast and easy. Works well on dishes too so it's not just strictly for bottles but for anything in the kitchen.  Nice long handle also. I wish I had found this years ago.
i have tried many brands and types of bottle brush and now i finally found the one.this brush is just enough soft and flexible to clean bottles well. The bristles are soft and yet sturdy to withstand pressure. Unlike rubber/silicone based brush whose bristles have no strength to stand straight, this will easily clean corner without having to jam the brush into the corner.Another good feature is the lenght, it is around a foot long, so you can use it to clean your vacuum flask/thermos easily as well.
It is surprisingly hard to find a brush like this. I just wanted it to be able to clean my travel mugs really well. I don't like putting them in the dishwasher and a sponge does not reach everywhere. This is a great brush for a good price. I have been using it for about a year and it still looks great, the bristles do not wear easily so I think it will last for a long time. I am now able to reach all those touch spots in my travel mugs, carafes, and vases.
It's a good sturdy brush, bends well, fits in what I need it for, but the bristles are only slightly rougher than a generic bottle brush. I use it clean glass bottles I fill with juice (from a juicer), and it doesn't get anything stuck on. It also stains easy. However, the grip is comfortable and it's a good length for 16oz glass bottles, and if you can find a different way to get things unstuck, it works just fine. I just wish it was rougher and a little longer wouldn't hurt. It does the job but aside from real sturdiness it's not much better than a generic brush.
Got this for cleaning out sport bottles and stainless thermal coffee cups.  Flexible.  The bristles are not very dense and the bristle material is very light.  This is NOT a scrub brush, and I actually have concerns about how long the lightweight nylon bristles will hold up over time, but this gets the job done.  The brush will fit into anything the width of the wand portion at the top, because the bristles are so soft, they flatten out and flow (almost like wet hair...).
I have always struggled cleaning my tea pot and my Nalgene water bottles.  I would stuff washcloths into them and spin them around but I never felt like I was doing a good job.  I saw this cheap little brush on amazon and figured I'd give it a go.  This brush helps me all the time now.  It can squeeze into the holes my hand can't fit in and I can move it around and scrub the insides.  I am impressed with this brush and am very glad I found it.
This is astoundingly dishwasher tolerant. It has emerged unscathed from the top rack of my dishwasher after pots and pans wash, 6 or 7 times already.Initially, I bought this to clean my tall ello glass water bottle with a narrow opening.  Now I use it on all hand wash serving and glassware.  The bristles are effectively scrub-y, are high quality soft nylon that doesn't scratch glass and collapses to fit into narrow mouth jars and bottles.  The handle is hand injury friendly with typical soft OXO comfort with appropriate density for a secure grip. A+
This bottle brush has a flexible handle and even fits into bottles with very small spouts (1" or 1.5", I'm not sure).  I use this to clean out my bottles weekly and am very happy with this purchase.  I chose to purchase this specific bottle brush because it is so highly-reviewed.  I bought this to replace a former bottle-brush, whose bristles were attached to the stem with wire (so they got bent out of shape).  I really prefer this one, it cleans so well, stays clean, and seems indestructible!
I use this to clean out all sorts of cups and bottles and it always maintains its shape.  Been using it for almost a year now and its still going strong.  Its really only for light cleaning though because the brush bristles are too soft to do much scrubbing, but they are the right softness to easily squish into a small bottle opening, which is what I bought it for.  I'd buy it again with the knowledge that its just a light duty brush specifically for water bottles/jugs.
We have had a couple really nice bottle brushes that have recently just given up completely and we needed replacements fast.  We looked at all the stores we regularly haunt, but did not find anything of a satisfactory type and quality.  So online I went and found this great sounding brush and decided to give it a tryout, so far it has performed flawlessly cleaning all sizes and shapes of bottles and containers of all types as well.  Overall this has been a great purchase, and I hope they have these in the future for when this one gives up the ghost in a few years...
This bottle brush is well made and GREAT for most things, but it has a THICK stem that will NOT go into regular size water bottles, so don't buy it for that! I tried to use it on the VOSS water bottle I use (recycle,) and for spice bottles, and my sport jug - it was hopeless. You need a regular old fashioned "baby bottle" brush with the thin wire stem for regular drinking bottles. OR TRY this incredible brush:Way Clean 33030 Bottle Brushwhich is under four dollars AND has a thinner shaft to fit more bottles, glasses, etc, and which is SLANTED to facilitate a thorough cleaning!
This brush is the best especially to clean out small mouthed bottles of all kinds & pitchers. To me the best part of this brush is it's flexibility to reach places that normal plain brushes can't reach like unreachable cracks, crevices & bends & curved glass. This thing rocks & I am very very happy that I purchased it & I will be telling a lot of people about it because it makes cleaning pitchers, water bottles, jars & any think a breeze to clean & I most definitely am extremely satisfied with this wonderful product & wonderful seller that packaged my product so well. Go get one you will be very happy that you did so.
I am becoming an OXO Superfan simply because their products meet most of my kitchen needs fully.  Of those OXO products I have, not one has failed and each has performed as advertised, but with more effectiveness than I expected based on their modest prices.  I bought this brush mainly to accompany a 6-pack of 18 ounce glass water bottles that would be hard to reach without a bristle brush.  In goes the OXO and out comes the unwanted material.  Luckily, the contents have been nothing but water and nothing else that we know of.  A simple and effective brush goes a long way around here and we highly recommend this one.
Great bottle brush for our household with three kids who all play sports.  So we are constantly washing water bottles that come home from games and practices.  This brush is perfect for cleaning these bottles.  (And I imagine it would work just as well for baby bottles.)  My only complaint is that the bristles compress or collapse over time, so I find I have to replace this brush about every 3 or 4 months.  I always buy the same one again, but I wish it lasted a bit longer!
I received this last week.  I bought it to clean jars and glasses.  Does not feel flimsy, does a good job.  The last two bottle cleaners I bought in the grocery store were of appalling quality.  This is in a whole different class.. it works!  I expect to feel the same way next month.June 2012:  This little miracle lasted for more than a YEAR.  I finally retired the first one two months ago and am now using the second one.  Talk about value for money spent!
Every morning I take a 16oz insulated thermos bottle into work with tea, coffee, yerba mate, juice, or something similar. My hands can't fit in any of my bottles. Most dishwashers aren't powerful enough to shoot water to the back of a thermos if it's in the dishwasher at and angle. This bottle brush is able to quickly, and easily clean the inside of any bottle. And for just $5, every bottle should get a decent cleaning once in awhile!Vinyl bristles are nice, don't deteriorate, hold soap well, and have just the right amount of flexibility to be stuffed into a bottle-top but just enough rigidity to get cemented-grime off bottle-walls.Hope that helps!
Sometimes a little thing makes a big difference and having the right tool for the job is one of those things.  I use a meat grinder several times a week to make pet food for cats and make sausages for myself. This requires scrupulous attention to cleanliness.  One of the parts was a little hard to clean on the inside, but this bottle brush makes the job a breeze.  It is both flexible enough to easily clean the interior, while the bristles are soft enough not to scratch the metal.  I also found it to be an excellent tool for cleaning the square glass containers that I use to store milk in the refrigerator.  As you know square kitchen containers can be tricky to clean.  This brush is long enough for half gallon containers, but it could be a little short for larger containers.  For my purposes, this brush would have been a good purchase at twice the price.
I have had this brush for over two years now and I use it constantly. The colored end bristles are a little stiffer then the white ones so it's great for the bottom of jars especially the ones you have to clean for recycling. Makes hard work a breeze. After extreme daily use it still looks brand new, I just put it in a glass with bleach and water every so often to keep it nice and fresh. I purchased two and the other one is still under the sink with the tag still on it because I just can't wear this thing out! I LOVE THIS BRUSH! I bought one for a friend who looked at me like I was insane when I raved about it and now she tells all her friends to get one too! Get this brush, it is an amazing very well made cleaning tool!
My large hands make it very difficult to wash the bottom of my insulated coffee mugs (the manufacturers recommend not putting them in the dishwasher). A regular wire core bottle brush does not work very well because there are not enough bristles on the bottom and the wire always bent the wrong way. This brush solves those issues quite well - there are plenty of bristles on the bottom, and the plastic handle flexes and allows extra pressure in the corners yet still returns to its original shape. The bristles are softer than those found on most bottle brushes, but still seem to do the job. I don't know how durable it will be, but my past experience with OXO products has been very good, so I expect this brush to last a long time.
My Casabella bottle brush broke.  The bristles started to falloff then the bristle head snapped off the handle as i was cleaning a bottle.  These were uber cheap $5 as an add-on and I like OXO stuff so I gave it a try.  The bristles are soft (which is what i wanted).  The length is perfect for my needs.Check the dimensions to see if it is long enough for you if you have tall bottles to clean.Shipped quickly and works as described and best of all was the price on amazon!
BOTTLE TYPES WE OWNWe have numerous water bottles and stainless containers (Foogoo, Camelbak, Thermos to name a few).  Some are BPA free plastic, some stainless inside and out.BOTTLE NECK SIZEThe neck opening of each of our bottles varies from 1.5 inches up to 3 inches (this is a Foogoo lunch container).BRUSH BRISTLES AND PERFORMANCEThis brush is the best one we have tried (we have tried three other brands).  The bristles are firm enough to clean the bottles, but soft enough not to scratch them (unlike others we have tried).  The handle just below the brush is flexible so it bends making it very easy to get every nook and cranny in all our containers.We use it on a daily basis.  I donated our other ones after receiving this.
Put quite simply, OXO has done it again!  The quality of this Good Grips Bottle Brush exceeds all expectations in both design and execution.  The engineers at OXO are experts at what they do and their dedication to customer satisfaction is clearly seen in this superb brush.  Anyone who has purchased any OXO product will testify to the satisfaction one feels in using said product as well as the incredible value OXO always presents.  The OXO Good Grips Bottle Brush satisfies as no other brush possibly can because no other proudly displays OXO on the label.  OXO defines value, excellence, durability, and satisfaction and the Good Grips Bottle Brush is virtually OXO writ large.
For years I had bottles and other narrow-mouth containers that needed cleaning. I would always find some way to cram a sponge or blast hot soapy water in there. I knew bottle brushes existed, but for some reason I just never got one. Somehow it came to mind to buy one on Amazon. This one is definitely a winner. It doesn't scratch like the cheap little ones my mom has. The long bristles and slightly flexible wand mean it can really clean just about anything very thoroughly. Just don't accidentally mix it up with a toilet bowl brush.
I just got this product yesterday.  I used it to clean out 4 of my water bottles and their lids.  Along with a long handle, the brush has bristles that stick up on the top and allow me to clean the bottome of the bottle very easily.  The brush also cleaned up under the rim of the bottles easily due to the direction of the bottom bristles.  It rinsed off easily and dried quickly.  So far, so good.  If it falls apart within 6 months I'll revise my review; otherwise I'd recomend it for cleaning water bottles/baby bottles/etc.
I have a SIGG water bottle that needed cleaning. My first search resulted in a special SIGG brush that was ~$9. This was ~$4. In combination with Efferdent tablets, this brush works great to clean and refresh the bottle and remove the metallic-y smell from my bottle. (DONT BUY THE SIGG TABLETS -- SIGG Tablets are 24 tablets for ~$8 while Efferdent, which works EXACTLY the same, is 120 tablets for ~$6!!!). Be smart people; Don't buy the SIGG branded stuff since this brush (and the Efferdent tablets) work just the same, if not better for a lot less money.
I like this brush, though I do wish it had a suction cup, or something, so it would be easier to be near the sink.  We lay it on the counter and let the brush part hang over into the sink.  It does a good job, though, even though the bristles are not as dense as other bottle brushes.  We had the other OXO brush with a stand, and while it was nice, the stand had a tendency to get moldy unless washed often.  For the price these are easy to replace when necessary.
OXO generally makes a good product. This is a nice brush. But for cleaning out my NISSAN 34oz themas it barely does the job. The handle should be about 3 to 4 inches longer and the bristles could be a little stiffer. A mix of stiff and softer bristles would be ideal. It works well for cleaning out my NISSAN Tea tumbler. Stiffer bristles would make getting the little ring of fine tea leaf residue that always seems to collect at the bottom and just wont rinse out at the end of the day when I finally get home. Its a good product just room for improvement.
I just bought this for 4 dollars and 99 cents at Target in Austin to use in my Soda Stream 1 Liter Bottles.SodaStream 1-Liter Carbonating Bottle, Gray, 2-PackI was concerned that it wasn't going to fit through the narrow opening in them, but that actually wasn't a problem at all.  It fit perfectly and worked great in them, so I tried it out in my Contigo coffee cup and in my large Thermos.  It did great in each application.  I am very happy with this brush.  It is well made, cleans thoroughly, and seems like it will last a very long time.  I have no complaints.
This bottle brush works really well to clean my stainless steel 27 oz water bottle. Here is why I like it:1. The diameter on the opening of my water bottle is 1 3/4 inches, and this easily fits inside.2. The handle and brush combined are a foot long, which makes it very easy to clean the bottom of the bottle.3. The leading negative review mentions another brush that has a slanted handle, which supposedly makes cleaning easier. But the handle on this brush is very flexible, and will bend and slant at whatever angle you want with just a little pressure.4. The bristles are effective at cleaning both the bottom and sides of the water bottle.5. The grip on the end of the handle is somewhat thicker, which makes it easy and comfortable to hold this brush while cleaning.Bottom line: This is sturdy and well made, and cleans effectively.
I had purchased a urinal for my husband on Amazon, and he asked me what he could clean it with.  So I got him this OXO good grips bottle brush.  While the bristles could come down a little farther on the handle, even if you were to use it for a baby's bottle, the bristles are very wide, (and flexible while still being sturdy), making it an asset to cleaning any kind of bottle at all. Again, a wonderful OXO product! (Get the impression I am a fan?).  He says he loves it, so five stars it is!
I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush, but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good, and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier.
I love the Polar thermal water bottles.  But they have "dimples" in the sides of them that make them difficult to clean.  All my cycling bottles collect a lot of fine road dirt in them.  Until now, I've mostly lived with some residual dirt in the bottle.  I add soapy water, close and shake.  That gets most of the ick out, but not all.  But this brush is THE BEST brush for cleaning out my cycling bottles.  The handle is long enough to reach the bottom of all my drinking bottles and gallon glass juice jars.  The bristles are soft enough that the brush can be inserted into narrow neck bottles.  And they are stiff enough to do a good job of cleaning.  I don't believe in purchasing lots of specialized cleaning gadgets, but this on is a must.
This is a great brush.  I use it for my 32oz Nalgene bottles and it works fine, but I also use it for my 16oz Takeya Glass Bottles and it especially works AWESOME for those because it touches all the sides of the bottle when it's in it!  When it's in the Nalgene bottle you have to circle it around to get all the sides, but not so with the smaller diamater bottles.  Handle is the perfect length and the bristles still stick out and look fine after 6 months of use.
Does a great job of cleaning out my protein shaker bottles.  I used to just use a sponge, but I couldn't get in the little crevices (like the shaker spout) to get out the protein that had dried in there.  With this brush, I can easily get into little corners, while also scrubbing out my shaker quickly and efficiently.  The bristles are also soft enough that it won't scuff up the plastic shaker.  All in all, I would consider this a must for anyone who doesn't have access to a dish-washer, or who only has one shaker and doesn't want to run the dish-washer for one item.
There are so many water bottles out there today that it's easy to end up with a collection of 10 or 20 before you realize you have nothing to use to clean the very bottom of the bottle.This brush does a great job reaching those tiny corners way down in the bottom of the bottle.  The bristles are flexible enough to be pushed into even small bottle necks so it will work for pretty much any water bottle out there today.  You can be brave enough to drink tea or juice out of your water bottles once you invest in this!
I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise, I not only like it, I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges.
I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy, easy to manipulate and clean, and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use, which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail.
I am a bit disappointed with this brush. It gets the job done but the bristles seem to splay out easily when using any sort of force. I was able to use this regularly for about three months before deciding the brush was well and truly dead and I needed to find another one. I am now looking around for a new one but if I don't find one to my liking I will probably get another one of these because although it is very short-lived, the grip is comfortable and it does work fairly well while it's still good.
I have white tile in all the bathrooms, and the grout gets stained. Nothing for it but to scrub the grout occasionally. Not my favorite job, but this brush is comfy and the handle is at the right angle.Here is the recipe I use to make grout cleaner. I think it works better than commercial sprays and it's cost-effective:1/2 cup of baking soda1/3 cup of ammonia1/4 cup of white vinegar7 cups of waterPour this into a spray bottle (not one use previously for bleach; I would suggest buying a clean, new bottle at the hardware store.) Spray on, scrub. Do not ever mix with bleach; ammonia and bleach release chlorine gas from the bleach and it is instantly toxic to the lungs and can overpower you quickly.
I am old enough to remember &#34;The Fuller Brush Man&#34;.  After the Korean War, many veterans sold door-to-door for the Fuller Company while they were trying to get back into civilian life.  The &#34;Fuller Brush Man&#34; came through our neighborhood several times a year.  Since I was the one who usually opened the door, I got a good dose of his wholesome first impression.  He carried a large well worn leather case.  When he opened it onto our living room floor, a fantastic array of brushes would spill out.  My mother always bought something.I guess OXO somehow fills the gap left by the missing &#34;Fuller Brush Man&#34;
This brush is considerably larger than a toothbrush and grips well in the hand. They call it a "a grout brush"; not for brushing freshly poured grout (cement), but for brushing in grout joints between tiles.I tried the brush in the shower using CLR liquid cleaner and the brush does a fine job of getting the CLR cleaner deep into the joints and the calcium, lime and mold deposits out. Also brushed the shower head several times and let the solution stand. Very satisfied about the results. Because of its narrow brushing head, the brush does well in the commode under the outer lip where fresh water enters and also down deep in the narrows of the commode.I also use this brush to brush the hardware fittings on my boat that have rusted. It works well.The brush is unlike any brush I have ever seen in the brick and mortar stores.When this one wears out, I will reorder another.
The stiff bristles on this OXO grout brush tackle even the toughest soap scum and mildew stains on grout with ease - even older white grout comes out looking nice!  The soft handle makes the chore of cleaning a bit less stressful on your hands, and the length is just perfect for the task of grout cleaning.  I find that spraying some shower cleaner, letting it soak for a few minutes, then tackling it with this grout brush makes my showers/tubs come out looking like new again.  The bristles on this brush have held up the test of time, and have yet to show signs of wear from multiple use.I wouldn't go back to any other type of brush again!
She wanted a brush to clean off the bottoms of her shoes, so I bought her one of these. When I saw it, I decided I wanted one of these for myself too. This Oxo brush has a very comfortable handle and is angled just right. I like using it to clean those seams where sink meets wall and bathtub meets wall. Even the bristles are just the right mix of flexibility and stiffness so one doesn't have to worry about scratching surfaces.For the current price (five dollars) this great brush is a bargain.
I always used a dishrag or a sponge for cleaning counter tops.  Then I read a review of this product that mentioned using the brush for counter tops and stainless steel sinks.  I am so glad that this review prompted me to buy this brush.  It really cleans up the counter tops and the stainless sink looks really great after cleaning with this brush.  It is also a great tool for cleaning the interior of the refrigerator.  It has cut down the time required to do that job, and just makes this weekly task more effective in less time.  It's an excellent investment and would have been worth the cost at twice the price.
This brush has a wide rubber grip handle and firm bristles.  What makes it a bit unique is its size - at 11.1" it is nearly a foot long.  You can use it to clean a large area where a smaller brush would make the job tedious, and in some instances to avoid bending as much due to its reach.The bristles are synthetic and fairly heavy gauge.  They can be used to clean corrosive acids and alkalis although this was made for use in bathrooms and kitchens.  I tested it on the shower floor and it's perfect for that type of work.The instructions say this brush can be cleaned in the dishwasher.  With most brushes, the high heat of a dishwasher would cause bristles to fall out.
After getting this brush I thought the overall size of it might be a problem, but proved it wasn't for the things I have used it on. One excellent job it does is cleaning a stainless steel sink. The bristles are long and stiffer making the task less tedious and using about half the time and elbow grease of the way I have been doing it. One thing that could be improved is the handle. It should be just a bit smaller around and have finger notches on the bottom for improved handling. That is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.
I've used this kit several times while traveling abroad.  The plug is handy, especially in older hotels that have sinks without a sufficient stopper.  My big problem is with the woolite packets.  Nearly every time I travel with these, at least one breaks open and spills all over my stuff.  Not a huge tragedy since it's soap, but a mess and a pain in the neck just the same.  I started packing them in ziplock baggies, so that WHEN not IF one of them bursts, the mess is contained.  The woolite does clean very nicely, though, and I can clean a few days of underthings and socks with one packet.
No one wants to spend vacation time washing clothes in a Laundromat, especially if you are overseas.  Having the laundry done by hotel staff is very expensive but I didn't want to tote dirty clothes around for 17 days!!!  And the fees airlines charge for extra or oversized luggage are ridiculous if you try to take the amount of clothing you need for a long trip.This was recommended by a friend and is the perfect compromise!!!  I love Woolite anyway and the sink stopper is a great addition.  I purchased a travel clothesline and pins and now can wash items as I wish anywhere!!  I will continue buying additional as we travel frequently.
I have used this kit three summers in a row to wash my delicates while traveling abroad. The sink stopper is a wonderful invention and tends to work on most tumba and deep sinks. On very small sinks, it will still work but you may notice it does not hold as tight of a seal. The soap packets are a good size, though I typically only use about half of the packet for six or so undergarments. As long as I fold down the top of the packet, the rest of the Woolite stays inside. The Woolite is easy to wash out and leaves my clothes clean and soft. I would highly recommend this kit to anyone going on a trip who may need to do an emergency load of laundry!
I bought this as well as the Carson Pendant magnifier. The lenses are both the same size.For starters, the GT 532 took 12 days to receive it! The Carson arrived in two days. Both ordered the same time...I recently had cataract surgery and opted to have my nearsightedness corrected, which left me unable to see anything closer than about 4'. I bought an assortment of reading glasses from Walmart, as well as these two magnifiers, just to get by for the moment.If I had to pick one or the other, the Carson is the winner. It is less bulky, and IMO, allows me to see better, with or without glasses.It has a better case as well. I will keep this for those moments when I forget what I did with the Carson Pendant magnifier.I also bought a lighted, free standing/handheld, 5x Carson FH-25 magnifier at Walmart for $13. I have not found any better product than what Carson has to offer.
The battery was exactly what I needed, it was not outdated and arrived quickly.  I sometimes find it difficult to locate the right button battery when one is needed; seems there is no rhyme or reason given to battery names.  When I open a product to see what is needed, I look up the battery number online and frequently get hits on batteries that do not even come close to resembling the one I have.  I am not sure why button batteries have so many different equivalent names, but I have included some below for this battery in the hopes it will help someone else.A76 equivalent batteries:  1128MP, 1166A, AG13, D76A, G13A, GPA7, GPA76, LR44, LR1154, L1154, PX675A, PX76A, RPX675, S76, V13GA, 357A, RW82, KA, A76, 208-904, SB-F9, G13-A, CA18, CA19, LR44, A-76, 76A
When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes, like the A 23, they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries, my money wouldn't go as far, as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give, is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container, to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries, for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy.
I had purchased (on Amazon) a battery operated remote door bell which I added to my front door.  Needless to say, the little 12 volt battery that came with the doorbell was an unknown brand and didn't last very long.  I could not locate the replacement battery in my local area grocery and drug stores.  I looked on Amazon and sure enough, they had them available!  I was especially pleased the batteries were Energizer, exactly the type I needed, and was a two-pack!  I really do tell my friends that if they can't find something, or if they do and it's too expensive or too far to drive to get it, look on Amazon!
I thought I was going to get the exact blister pack that was pictured but it wasn't, instead I got the retail single blister packs where the batteries are made in China.  Both work but the twin blister packs are made in the USA and lasts at least 50% longer, next time I'll ask the seller if they are selling this exact blister pack or if they are selling the 2nd rate single retail blister packs.  I won't return it for a few dollars but I would have paid an extra 2 bucks to get the originals with an expiration date printed.  I hope this helps potential buyers of this product.
You can say abracadabra and open sesame as often as you like, but opening your garage door will remain a no-go unless you have a still functional pair of these essential A23 batteries properly inserted in your garage door opener.These are batteries and everyone knows that a battery is a battery is a battery - nothing all that profound to report in this regard.Nevertheless, these batteries are well suited to their specific purpose and do what you expect them to do: they definitely will get that garage door open when magical incantations won't.Since it's not quite my thing to get too excited about batteries, let's just give this power-packing, very reasonably priced pair 4 out of 5 stars and call it a day.Next item please!
This battery is just great. I ordered one for my HP laptop's remote controller. I would rate this battery A+++++, would buy it again. Although it has not shipped yet, so I am not sure on the quality, I can guarantee this is the battery you need for your HP Pavilion entertainment PC dv6915nr with Altec Lansing speakers. I know , because I did the hard ground-level research, opening the controller, finding the battery, removing the battery, examining the battery, finding the name of the battery, replacing the battery, closing the battery containment area, and so on.
I bought theEnergizer ECR2032 Watch Batteryfor our bathroom scale, and expected it to last a year or more, like the original battery did. However, it is weakening after only a few months. I bought the battery December 2009, but it had a manufacturing date of July 2009. Could it be that the battery was too old? Is this short lifespan a problem with the battery in general, or these batteries in particular? I don't know.At this price, though, I cannot complain too much. Free shipping with Amazon Prime makes this an incredibly good deal, so I ordered another one. Hopefully, it will last a bit longer. The packaging this time is different (not the same as the picture shown), but the battery is still old--February 2010.
I had to get a new battery for my XM radio remote control. This was the size I needed, but I never thought about getting it on Amazon. I went to the drug store and paid over $5.00 for the same battery. When I went home to install it I thought I would just check to see if Amazon had one online. Sure enough, I bought this one and took the one I purchased from the drug store back for a refund. I even told the counter person that I had to return it due to the price. So far the battery works just fine.
I have an old APC UPS that uses this battery, and every 2-3 years, the battery dies.  I always replace it with a genuine APC battery because then I get free mail-in recycling.  I wouldn't know what to do with my old battery otherwise.One way you can tell if it's genuine APC is if it includes instructions on how to send the battery back to APC for recycling.  I purchased my batter from "Amazon.com LLC", and it is genuine.  I removed the old battery and put the new one in, and my UPS works great now.  I expect it to last another 2-3 years.
After I bought one of these and started using it, my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long, the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads, because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth, and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter.
We have 3 of these, and have been pleased since the beginning (about 3 years ago). Your mouth will feel wonderful after each use (though it takes a bit of getting used to, and beginners are warned to use the included damping ring to decrease the intensity for a while). We have had 2 occasions to return one to the factory, but they were replaced under warranty with little fuss (both dead batteries). There have been subtle changes as newer models have come out. I like this latest itineration best, as its tiny green LED on the on/off switch makes an adequate navigational beacon through a dark bathroom. One word of caution: my family will not travel without these things, so while I preach 'pack light', they tote their Sonics everywhere we go. Fortunately, one charge lasts at least a week, so the charging base is only needed on extended trips.
Gimmicky tech stuff drives me crazy, but this product is worth every penny you pay for it.  Although you might be used to scrubbing your teeth (and I admit that can be therapeutic at times), the super-charged foam will actually do a much more thorough job of ridding your teeth of plaque.  My oral hygenist said that use of the Sonicare has made my normally very good-looking gums fabulously heatlhy.  I'm another person that wishes I had had one years ago; it may have helped me prevent the loss of a tooth.My oldest son's orthodontist gave him a Sonicare, because they believe it is the most effective toothbrush for cleaning teeth with braces.  We're buying another for my younger son, as he now has a retainer. The sensation of using it may be a little unusual at first, but you will quickly become used to it.  Believe me, you want this product!
Pros:  Does a great job of cleaning teeth, and it's easy and comfortable to use.However, it's not without problems.  First off, mine has developed cracks around the handle that are *slowly* propogating through the plastic.  Never dropped the thing or treated it roughly - it just started cracking after a month or two.  I'll have to hope they cover it under warranty if it finally falls apart.My main complaint, however, is the lack of easily replaceable batteries (note that the Braun and Interplak are guilty of this as well).  It seems horribly obnoxious - as well as environmentally irresponsible - to charge this much for a product that's going to have to be thrown away after a couple of years when the NiCd's go.  Instead of a ... battery, you're stuck buying another ... toothbrush...yeesh.
The Sonicare toothbrush is really a breakthrough. I've had mine for almost a year (on the advice of my dentist as well as other Sonicare owners), and it works extremely well.Not only does this device make brushing my teeth quicker and more relaxing, but they simply get cleaner. More important, my dentist says the health of my gums (leading cause of tooth loss) is extremely good since I started using the Sonicare.The feature where it beeps every 30 seconds is pretty useless, and the auto-off after 2 minutes is downright annoying (I like to brush for 3-4 minutes).The brush can run for a week between recharges, and the charging stand is small and attractive. The whole thing is easy to keep clean, quite well designed.One caution: you need to replace the brush head every 6 months.... However, it's worth it for better dental and gum health.
Excellent product but a little pricy, relatively speaking.If you own a rotary shaver, then you're going to have to get new blades at some point.  The high cost of these replacement blades makes me second-guess my decision to purchase a rotary shaver, to begin with!Oh well...I'm stuck having to continue buying these blades, unless somebody develops a means with which to effectively sharpen the old blades. I just can't bring myself to throw away my ($$$) rotary shaver. That thing cost me a hundred bucks!
I have had very little problem with this unit. Now & then, when trying to get the lather to come out slowly, you will get a little bit of very hot water in your hand right when the lather first starts to come out. It's not comfortable, but doesn't really burn. The lather, itself, comes out nice and warm and feels very good on the face. Whether it actually helps your shave or not, I have no idea; I haven't really noticed a difference. The great benefit is the nice warm lather on your face.
After using one for 7 years or so the old professional gave out finally.  The NEW one I had to buy at Target (sorry Amazon when your toothbrush is broke asap is more important then price).  I did the full charge last night and let it run down without a brush on and I am charging it back up to full.  Just got done using it again before bed.  This electric toothbrush is better then their last model and more powerful.  I can tell by how clean my teeth are.  Thanks a bunch Oral B for the High Quality Product.
I've used an Oral B since 1993, and am on my 3rd one. The first one finally "burned" out a few years ago, and the 2nd one I somehow left in a motel room, and it conveniently got "lost" (hope the maid is enjoying it), as when I called that afternoon, "nothing had been found"...These cannot be beat. Like many other reviewers have said, the dentist's ALWAYS notice the difference when people switch to these.Personally, I always brush on high speed until it beeps, then I switch to low speed, and re-brush, and then go onto my gums and tongue before stopping.A Great Tool, from a Reliable Mfg., Not to be Beaten! If you've not used one of these, by all means, GO OUT AND GET YOURSELF ONE, NOW!! You'll NEVER regret it! ~operabruin
B000050FDE: Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Power Toothbrush  Am pleased as punch with this dental device, which puts others to shame.  In fact, the soniCare 1126 corpse that it replaced is patiently waiting for proper disposal.  I don't know if toothbrushes have chemicals in them which would pollute the environment if given half a chance.   I don't recall when the Philips soniCare was first used, but even at first brush, it never performed as well for me as the Oral-B.  Different strokes for different folks.   This Gold Box item leaves my mouth feeling super clean each time I use it, and I particularly like the double-head brushes.  Thank you, Amazon, for making this available to me at an "irreteethable" price.
This is my second electric toothbrush.  I upgraded this time based on a recommendation and have to say it lives up to it's description.  When fully charged - it will take you through an extra long vacation without re-charging. I like the smaller brush that allows you to get around bridge work and between teeth, and that it lets you know when you've done 2 minutes worth (started out determined to always do this --- think I'm down to a minute -- but teeth and gums look and feel good.) Only thing I'd like is a bigger head on the main brush, so that my minute was covering more teeth area.
I charged it for 18 hours as it requested from the get go. Once I start it up, after about every 15-20 seconds, it hiccups for 1 second.  Not bad of a product.  Feels different since I use less toothpaste now (compared to brushing manually).  I feel like a lazy hygienist now, with the lack of desire to brush my own teeth because the feeling of "Success!" and "Clean!" isnt' there anymore.  However, I will use this product until it is dead. I also bought it discounted from the amazon gold box.If there were no hiccups, I'd give it a 4. that's the main defect (with mine at least).  I do like the waterproof-ness, but I don't need it since I don't brush in the shower.-MCUpdate: Upping to 4star
My dentist scolded me for thrashing my gums by brushing too hard and for having too much plaque. He insisted I get the Braun Oral-B, which he said was the best of its kind. I'm glad I did. The design has a soft mode for people with sensitive gums and it has cut down my plaque, far better than had I used a conventional toothbrush. Also the device is easy to use and maintain so I'm confident I'll use it consistently. Finally, I must say my teeth feel far more clean and smooth now. The Braun no doubt will have prevented me from getting some serious dental work.
Compared to a regular tooth brush my teeth feel so much cleaner, and the vibration is enjoyable as well.The battery life is great, however it seems to take a while to fully charge. This is not a problem at all though because you don't need it to be fully charged to use it.The charger base is easy to clean even if dried up tooth paste begins to build up on it.As far as replacement heads, I went with theGeneric Oral-B Dual Clean Compatible Replacement Brush Heads (4 ct.). They work great and are cheaper than the Oral B brand replacements.Highly recommend this powered tooth brush.
I had the older version of this from a couple of years back, and that older one felt stronger - and is still going strong. I got this one for my husband, and I did not like it nearly as much. The water tends to splatter more than my old one, and the vibration is bigger but not deeper.For the price I paid, though, it was fine. I just can't justify giving it 5 stars when it doesn't add up to the quality of its previous versions.
I bought this for my husband because he really liked the idea of a self-cleaning razor.  It worked okay for a month or so and then broke.  He sent it in for repair and it came back working properly.  A few months later, it broke again. Again it was fixed.  Props to customer service for this.Since we were already going broke paying for the cleaning solutions, when it broke a third time, we decided it wasn't worth the hassle and bought a different one.
There is a newer offering from braun which I also have. The 7526 razor has been around for several years now and is by far the best one ever made. I have had mine for well over 7 years now and it still works like a champ! I have had to replace the foil and blade twice and the replacements are for sale on amazon. I accidently plugged the cord into only one slot on a power strip and it ruined the power cord so I thought I would "upgrade" to the newest version. The newer razor did not shave as good as my trusty old one. So I purchased a power cord and I have since packed the new one away in the attic. I'll never give up this razor! It holds a great charge and I am still using the original battery.
I've used Braun razors for over 25 years, and while this model isn't as good as some of the older simpler models, it still works fine. It's great to be able to purchase screens and cutting blocks on Amazon as it's hard to find these in local drug stores. Thanks for providing such great service and just for being there Amazon!By the way, Braun has a great, simple little battery-powered travel shaver that I now use as my main shaver, and then I use my older model for the side trimmer. The little guy is only about $15 and does a great job, and even has its own rotating screen cover. Very neat.
This razor has been pretty crappy to me.  I got it as a Christmas gift about 1 1/2 years ago.  After about 1 year, the foil got a tear in it, so I paid $26 and got the replacement pack (turns out Braun doesn't sell just the foil anymore).  About 6 months after I bought the replcement, the foil got another tear in it.  Now it nicks me every time I use it.  It does a nice job, but it is crap for $30, spend a little extra and get a better razor.
The manufacturers of electric shavers appear to be taking pages out of the playbook used by makers of printers, which are often priced cheaper than the print cartridges themselves.  Once they've got you as a customer, they figure the red ink will soon be the customer's, not theirs.  Purchasing another screen (my 3rd or 4th in two years) for a shaver that cost me only 20% more than the flimsy foil itself strikes me as exhorbitant if not exploitive.  (The least Braun could do is make the foil available as a separate item rather than bundling it with the cutter assembly.)  I'd try a Norelco or Remington, but I think they're all manufactured in China for the same U.S. company (Gillette?).  I may bloody my face for a few more days before throwing in the towel--or trying a Panasonic.
This is the replacement foil and cutter for the Braun Syncro line of men's electric razors.  Braun recommends that you replace the set about once per year.  I am a gentle user and can get slightly more usage out of mine.  Your foil and cutter may also last longer if you lubricate your razor with something like Remington's lubricant.  The Syncro's cleaning system will also lubricate the blades for you; however, the cost of replacement cleaning cartridges make that an expensive option.Basically, you do not want to wait until you have a hole in the foil to replace the set.  A hole in the foil can result in your face getting a cut from the oscillating blades beneath.  So please, change your foil and cutter set regularly.
Although the part numbers have changed over the years, this foil / blade combination fits my Braun shaver. I typically get two or three years of use out of these blades. This new set made the shaver feel like brand new again. I always store the shaver in the charger / cleaning base. The programed cleaning probably addes to the longevity of the blades.Changing the blades is super simple. Pry off the foil by the plastic base. Pull on the coiled cutter cartridge. Snap in the new cartridge, and snap the foil over that. Takes all of two minutes even when I haven't done this for a long time.Braun Clean & Renew Refills (3 Pack)
I gave this item a bad ratings because it is NOT the claimed model listed as being sold!  This is the newer (and by many opinions poorer) design with blades oriented horizontally under the foil.  I cannot find the older vertical style block for my 8000-series anymore, and saw a review for that line stating the 7000-series fit, and that most of the 7000 series were the old style.  Disappointed with Braun for changing the design without offering alternatives (an electric shaver is quite the investment), and the seller for not updating information- giving me false hope of getting the old style block/blades.  I'll keep and use these, but would have enjoyed seeing if the old kind cut better/last longer.
Have been using these Braun Clean & Renew Refills for several years now.  They do a good job of helping to clean the razor (after you get rid of the hair debris).  Used to purchase them at various stores especially if I could find them on sale, which was almost never.  I have watched their prices continue to go up & up.  Then one day I found them on Amazon at their Subscribe & Save area at a cheaper price, especially because this package comes with 3 refills which is a money saver.  The only negative comment I will make is that once opened, each refill only last about 30 days -- sure wish Braun could figure out a way to make them last a little longer.
Sure, you can run your shaver head under the faucet to clean out the whiskers.  The alcohol in these cartridges also disinfect your shaver foil and blades.  That's important since you are shaving so close with the Braun you are bound to get unnoticeable micro cuts that might harbor harmful bacteria.  The auto clean function works surprisingly well also.  I tested it by not shaving for three days and then shaved and stuck it on auto clean.  After the cycle was done, I pulled the head and inspected.  Spotless!  That is very impressive.  The Braun engineers deserve kudos for their innovations and making the world's best shaver.
I use this with a Braun 8000 series activator (8585 I think). They are expensive (so is the shaver) but the system does work.  The first one lasted over 5 months, using it every 2 to 3 days on average.  No evaporation loss that I could tell.  You can add a small amount of alcohol to extend it but I am not sure that is within warrantee, etc.  I did shake the shaver blade out before using the cleaner, so that made it clean and fresh.  However, when I finished the cartridge there was a very fine screen on the intake side so it may not have been necessary.  One thing to note is that you cannot take this on a plane - even if you check luggage.I am sensitive to smells, but the lemon scent was not a problem even though I could smell it when the freshly cleaned razor was right under my nose.
These are original quality replacements.  When I first received my system I would only use the self clean function occasionally because I wanted to be frugal with the cleaning solution.  The more I have experimented the more I agree with others that a lot of the fluid is lost due to evaporation whether you use it or not, so just use it.  I tap my shaver's screen daily to clean it and use this about once a week.  I get several months out of each refill that way.  If you're not going to run it at least weekly, then remove the cartridge and cap it between uses for cleaning.  Although at that point you have to ask yourself why you even bothered buying into the clean and renew system.
At first I thought that a self-cleaning razor was gimmicky, but after owning for several years now I think that this function is highly useful and that it keeps the expensive razor and blades in decent condition.  My one complaint about the refills is that because they are alcohol based product, it evaporates, so if you shave infrequently and therefore clean infrequently, the product does not last for very long.  The idea of removing the cartridge and capping is decent, but seems like more of an hassle than it's worth.
It took me a while to realize that one has to keep these closed when not in use (a few days between cleaning) otherwise it evaporates. Naively, I assumed that whoever designed the cleaner for my braun shaver thought of it already. But they did not.OK, that part can be dealt with - just keep your original cover, and put it back on every time after use.But what surprised me the most was that my cleaner says that the refill is empty when it is not. It is more then half full.Now I am motivated to figure out how to refill these on my own with 99% pure alcohol...
These work with both my Braun's.  I have an older one and decided I would buy a new model instead of replacing the heads.  The first one was not their top of the line, the second unit I decided to go all out as the first one had been great.  I know it is these cleaner kits that go into the base station for both that make a huge difference.  When I was traveling 200+ days a year and I'd get home (and the device would be begging for an intense cleaning) the cleaning made the device like new.  Just a great system...not on the cheap side as it is an added disposable cost, but it makes a big difference on the effectiveness of the shaver.  If you have a unit that takes these it is worth keeping them fresh and ready to go to get the real benefit out of your wonderful shaver.  if not, get one with your next shaver...it's worth it!
I've been a user of Braun electric shavers for over 5 years. I recently upgraded to a new model and I have been noticing that the Clean & Renew cartridges have a shorter life span, from about 3 months to less than 2 months, not sure if it has to do with the new shaver using more cleaning product or that Braun changed the formula and it now has a higher evaporation point. I keep monitoring and researching around to see if I'm the only one, but so far I give it only 3 stars because of thisBut the Frustrarion Free Pack is great, it greatly reduces the amount of useless cardboard and excess material. Good job there!
These worked great for my 790cc shaver. I don't use the alcohol cleaning function much. I wash thoroughly with water after every use, and do an economic clean once or maybe twice a week. One of these end up lasting me 3-4 months easy; I didn't have any evaporation issues like other people have mentioned, not sure why that is. Amazon "subscribe and save" is a great way to save money on this product, since it does seem rather pricey for just some alcohol mixture. They're probably refillable if you can figure out how not to make a mess out of it; although I'd sooner dish out the 10$ a year for these in convenience.
I've been using the Braun cartridges for years with no complaints. The new packaging from Amazon is a nice improvement - the four cartridges are packed in a single box that is shipped as-is. Less cardboard waste than the old packaging, and a better price per cartridge.To make the cartridges last longer, re-use the plastic tab that covers the openings to keep the cartridge sealed when not in use. I run my series 7 through a cleaning cycle about once a week or so, and can get months of use out of a cartridge as long as it's kept capped to prevent evaporation.
The clean and renew system works very well, at least for the shaver part of the razor.  It does not remove longer hairs from the trimmer.  It does seem to keep the blades sharper for a longer period of time, and to improve the "feel" of the shave.  Each refill appears to last about a month, and the system seems to sense the total time the shaver is used and adjust the length of the cleaning.  About once a week the system does a "heavy" cleaning.  The system obviously has a "cost" associated with the refills, but overall, it seems to be worthwhile.
These cartridges are somewhat pricey. This fluid keeps my Braun razor working perfectly. I think it is now about five years old, and works as well as it did the first day. The razor was expensive at the time, so slightly expensive cleaning cartridges are to be expected. Given the grunge that's in the bottom of these cartridges at the end of their life, I'd never try to replace the fluid myself. I think the whole idea of saving a few pennies on an expensive shaver like this is a false economy.
This product is used to clean and lubricate your Braun electric razors. They are reasonably priced and last a good amount of time. They have a lemon-alcohol kind of scent to them which I have grown to really like. These really work too. Sometimes when I don't get a chance to order extras and don't clean my razor for a few days I can really feel the difference. Shaving is much more painful because the razor starts to pull your hair more instead of clipping it.Don't get too complacent through. I would still recommend occasionally taking a brush and air can to the razor to get it extra clean.
Braun's cleaning system is efficient and effective and saves you from manually cleaning your shaver every day. You just have to decide if it's worth paying about $5 per month to have your shaver cleaned automatically for you. For me, it is. I take a tiny bit of pleasure every day in clicking the "on" button after shaving and walking away, knowing the shaver will be clean and ready to go when I need it. When I travel, I don't bring the cleaning unit, so I use a brush to manually clean the shaver every day, which (a) takes a few minutes, and (b) isn't as effective as the cleaning unit. So it's four stars, withholding one star just for the price.
This is designed for a specific Braun shaver/cleaner system and is convenient and works very well; simply insert and use.  I find when it reads "low" I just add some isopropyl alcohol and it lasts longer. This is a very good value for 3, but is still $5+ each. Though this little box arrived packaged very poorly in a large, smashed, under-protected box, the 5 stars is for the quality product, convenience, and ease of use. Very easy to insert, use, and cleans and lubricates a really nice shaver. I am a long time Norelco fan yet I prefer my Braun shaver and cleaning system to my Norelco XL.
I received a Braun shaver for Xmas last year and looked around for refills to keep the shaver clean.  We even thought of refilling ourselves but after the first try, this was not the ideal solution to using the refills.  We found these at Walmart for a good price but then when those refills were almost gone, I searched for a better price.  The Amazon automatic supply system for refilling these ended up being the best price anywhere and, with free shipping and scheduled shipments, this is one less thing we have to concern ourselves with.  Great product -- excellent value.
I have been using this now for about 7 years and it is great.  First it keeps the razor clean and lubricated, so it never gets that bogged down feel or sound, second it has a nice fresh scent not the old stale cut hair smell that electric razors tend to pick up after periods of use.  It is my perception, I don't know if it is an actual fact that my blades tend to last longer before I need to replace them.  I love these cartridges, mine also last longer than the product description often not having to change them but every 2-3 months.
I'm rating this 5 stars because it works great. I'm like many people that try to use their Braun cleaner fiuld for too long. I've added water and rubbing alochol, but it just doesn't feel as good when cleaned. I stocked up on these from Amazon to always have freash cleaning fluid in the house. I don't pay sales tax and shipping is FREE when purchasing items over $25 combined. If you want to keep your Braun razor in great shape and get a clean, smooth and fresh shave, get this and change timely.
Now that Amazon has lowered the price to less than $4 each, this is a very good deal.  Better than you can get at Target, Walmart, etc.I think these refills make the Braun Syncro shaving system the best out there.  Nothing like a fresh, lemony, sanitary shave every morning.  I have noticed an improvement in my complexion since going to this system.So far my refills have been lasting 5-6 weeks each, which helps to increase the value and lower the cost.
I have been using this product for close to a year now with my Braun electric razor.  The product works very well in cleaning and refreshing my razor.  I use it after every shave.  It has helped keep my razor sharp and non greasy. I like the fact it isn't loaded with a bunch of toxic ingredients yet it gets the facial hair and grease out perfectly.  The product lasts over 30 days for me. It also has a pleasant fragrance so when you use your razor again it has a nice fresh clean and not overbearing fragrance to it. This product will help my razor last a very long time. The price was good. The product arrived two days before estimated delivery date in perfect condition. It was packed in a Braun package so they ust have just grabbed it off the shelf and sealed and shipped it. All in all the price was good.  I love the subscription option.  It saves you a nice amount of change over time.
I buy these on Amazon because they cost less than they do at any of the large local stores.  I shave every other day and set the razor to clean after every shave and I find these last quite a while, long enought that I can not reall the last time I put one in, it must have been about two months ago, it is showing the low level light now.  Given this usage I think I go through about three packs a year, not bad to have a nice shave when I want and keep the blad running smooth.
I bought these for my friend, who needed refills for his Braun shaver system...I told him that he'd be better off getting them through me because I can get it in 2 days with my Prime Membership--and they'd be cheaper than the drugstore prices.I was right about the drugstore price comparison.However--when they didn't show up in 2 days, I called Amazon.  It turns out that the shippers require that these be sent regular-speed (something about Hazardous Materials), so it took 10 days to get here.  You cannot order these with the 2 day shipping.As far as the quality--they are the refills that are designed for the unit, and work just perfectly as expected.The Braun Shaver Systems rule :)  According to my friend, at least ;)
I've been using my Braun shaver and the refills for almost a year and a half. Like others, I thought the refills might last longer by cleaning my razor every other use. I eventually realized that the refill didn't last any longer, so now I use the cleaning function after each use. I get a fresh shaver for each use and feel as though I'm getting my money's worth from the refills. One note...I always save the cap/top of the refill. If you're planning on being away from your cleaning unit for several days or more, you should cap the refill. You're refill will last longer as you won't lose any fluid to evaporation.
I find that cleaning the Braun shaver in the cleaning base with this solution just a couple of times a week is enough.  If you snap the cap back on the cartridge between uses, you can slow down the evaporation and make the cartridge last at least two months.  The bright blue solution will slowly turn gray from the accumulated whisker debris.  When it gets ugly enough, and when the level of liquid starts to get low from evaporation during use, you'll use your own judgement about when to start a new one.
I have been using these now for almost 10 years.  Every now and then I will go 2 months without buying more because of the price.  Let me tell you from experience that they do increase the shavers ability to shave closer and faster.  I think it must have something to do with the lubrication it provides the blades and internals of the shaving head.  For the best price though, buying them from Amazon and using subscribe and save 9on the 3 pack0 will get you the best price available.  So if you don't mind taking more time and working a bit more to get every hair and make it really close you can do without these (but you still MUST open the head and clean the whiskers out every now and then) or just spend the few bucks through S&S like I mentioned and have a quick easy close shave.
I've been using a Braun shaver and these cleaning cartridges for over two years.  They are worth the money---the shaver is clean and glides over my face for each shave.For what it is worth, I'll add a comment that the Braun 8985 Series 5 shaver itself is one of the best-engineered products I have ever encountered. I'm always finding flaws in electronics, etc.  The Braun seems to defy me!!Some have complained about the price of the cartridges.  They are worth it as I have said.  You can keep the shaver clean by following directions to "vibrate" the hair clippings out and then use a brush---I've done this on trips of up to one month with great success, but that isn't like using the cleaner mechanism with liquid.
I have the Braun 8585 razor; see my review there for my thoughts on that.I do love the cleaning fluid despite what I think about the razor.  It works great - I've opened the razor after a cleaning cycle and the inside is spotless.  The smell is pleasant too.Best of all, it lasts.  One cartridge lasts me 3 months.  I only clean my razor when the "normal" light is on, or every 2-3 shaves.  The cost to clean my razor works out to less than $20/year.  That's a bargain to me.  No more brushes or hot running water!  Now if only the razor did a better job...
I bought my Braun razor with the full expectation of having to shell out some extra cash on the cleaning cartridge refills every once in a while. I like the cleaning function and I use the cleaning function after every shave. It's a great shaving system and I've been very happy with it so I don't see a reason for messing with it to save a few bucks by trying to make my own cleaning solution. The few times I've had to clean the razor with water (i.e. I was travelling) I noticed that my shave wasn't as close and smooth as when I used the cleaning system.I do clean as much hair from the razor before docking it to clean it in the hopes that the solution will last longer. I'm also going to consider resealing the cartridge between shaves since evaporation is a very big problem in reducing the life of the cartridges (thanks to other reviewers for suggesting that).
Having switched from a long time Braun user to a Norelco Sensotouch 3D I still have my 790cc Braun. When P&G; bought out Braun they discontinued the foil and cutter block with a generic that pales in comparison to Braun Optifoil. I switched to the Norelco and the cleaning system system is a marvel.However I still prefer my old Braun and was lucky enough to have bought extra foils prior to them being phased out. The Braun clean and renew system is still in my opinion the best there is. The solution strips the blades and foil of all gunk, oils and whiskers - it's like a brand new razor every morning.This is a great deal on a 4 pack of refills. Plus if you have a Prime membership you get Free two day shippin to boot. The frustration free packaging is a real plus and cuts down on waste - I choose it whenever it's available.
These cleaners do a decent job of cleaning the razor but after a lot of use it is stuck on there and requires manual scrubbing to clean them so I took a star of for that.  The other star missing is because they are expensive and they evaporate. Since they do this, I plug the cap back onto the container once it is done cleaning, raise the shaver up and just wait until the next time I need it.  I find doing this extends the life of one of these to probably double the time.  If it looks really clogged and dirty I just use it until I think it is not useful anymore.  It's a tough call, I want the razor cleaned once and a while but these things break the bank over a year of use so trying to cut back where I can.
The product appears to be correct but the box is different on the two boxes I ordered.  They are both the same part number.  When the order quantity of an item is two or more, the warehouse should make sure the delivered product looks identical.  I would never buy the same item with different packages at a local store, and Amazon should be more careful when pulling orders because this practice causes doubt that the product is identical.  I have had this same result on other Amazon shipments where the quantity of an item was more than one. Old vs. new stock packages are often different.  Some manufacturers even totally change the product while keeping the part number the same (no revision letter change).
Guys if you have a thick beard that is prone ingrown hairs, this product may be your solution. By cleaning and lubricating my Braun shaver with this solution, I have significantly reduced painful razor bumps. While the shave isn't as close as premium blades, the loss of pain is well worth the shortcoming.Two tips: 1) I  recommend cleaning the hair particles out of the shaver manually so as to get the most out of the solution. Occasionally, I will even clean the foil and block with ethyl alcohol before placing the saving2) Prevent evaporation -- consistently leaving the saver in the stand will help preserve the volatile solution more effectively.  If you live in an extremely arid climate and are extremely frugal, covering the whole stand with 2 gallon zip lock bag might help.
There is nothing like the smell and feel of a newly cleaned electric razor.  I know they say to clean it when the yellow light comes on but this happens every 3 days.  I do not like leaving the whole unit out so I take the cleaning base out every Sunday, once a week.the solution does a very good job of cleaning it and it smells fresh on the next shave.  I only use it once a week and the solution lasts longer, it does not evaporate.  I estimate this 4 pack will last about one year.
There's not too much to say about these...they do what they're supposed to!  I clean my razor using the self-cleaning system nearly every day and it really amazes me how clean the razor comes out.  Not only is it clean, but it's lubricated and smells nice.  It truly does feel like you're using a brand new razor every day.  There are lots of reviews on here complaining that the stuff doesn't last long enough, but I find that they last about a month if you use them fairly regularly, and that's about what I'd expect from them.  Sure, you can only use them once a week, seal them in between uses, and make them last a lot longer.  But, I don't find them overpriced and I like that my razor is clean and fresh every day.  It's much faster than thoroughly cleaning the razor yourself, and works better than just using a brush and water.
You open your Braun cleaning station, slide out the old cartridge and slide in one of these.  Next time you dock/charge your razor, it's cleaning like new. Holy crap batman! Amazing.I wish these were a bit cheaper.  Seriously.  $20 for 4 plastic containers manufactured by children in China, filled with alcohol, coloring, and some other solvent.  It actually seems like a waste. Why not just sell big bottles with the cleaner that we could pour into the container that comes with the razor?
I've been using a Braun Syncro shaver system for quite some time, and have always used the Clean & Renew refills to keep my shaver clean, lubricated, and ready to go for the next shave.  Cleaning with these isn't a necessity, but it does take away the chore of having to do it myself.The cost of these, in my opinion, is worth the price for a smooth shave every time without any fuss of having to take the shaver apart to clean it, or having to remember to make sure to lubricate the blades as frequently - plus the lemon scent is a nice added bonus!
Supposedly this keeps the blades clean and sharp. It sure seems to work. But after about 1-1.5 months, the fluid seems to stop working regardless of how many times you've used it to clean the razor.So plan on buying more than a few of these. For certain it really cleans the razor and so far the blades are only about half as dull as they normally would be. So a big plus, but I really don't like having to buy all these accessories and you can't travel with these as they are flammable. I wonder how just plain alcohol would work instead as it'd be a lot cheaper. Just bring an empty container and fill it with alcohol?I'd like it if these refills weren't flammable so I could take them on the plane and also if they were cheaper, and lasted longer than a month.
I have used this product for years. I don't have a heavy beard, and sometimes I shave in the shower, so I usually don't clean my shaver with this product more than once or twice a week and it works fine. I can definitely feel the difference after my shaver has been cleaned using this product.I agree that using this product is not inexpensive over time, but to me this is just a cost of maintenance (like periodically changing the oil in my car). Also, if my shaver has had heavy use without using this product (like when I go away on vacation for a week), I use a brush to clean out the shaver before using this product.
First of all...I have never used a electric shaver before I got my Braun Pulsonic last year.  I have never had to worry about cleaning solutions etc etc...  I am not AFFILIATED with Braun in any way.  Just a consumer.People are complaining about spending $5 a month on these cartridges....while I understand that it seems like robbery..it is NOT!The cleaning cartridges not only clean the shaver but also add much needed lubricants to the shaving heads.  This process alone increases the lifetime of the blades and the electric shaver.I spent a ton on razor blades and shaving cream in the past...so these cartridges are of no significant cost to me.Last but not least...if you dont want to run the razor through a cleaning cycle daily, you dont have to.  Do it every 2-3 days and one cartridge will last you over a month....easily.  Last one I had was used for about 48 days...yes I counted.Thanks
I have been using these for several years now.  I wish they would last longer than they do for there is a bit that evaporates over time.  But, it does a nice job cleaning the shaver.  It is recommended to NOT refill these with alcohol, although i often check these and when they are around 2/3's full, i will add some alcohol and fill it back up.  I do it only the one time and this makes them go further.I did that once when the unit was about 1/4 full... and it actually made it more difficult to get my shaver clean.  However, at 2/3's full or 3/4's full... and then adding some alcohol... that works well and i get an extra 2 week'ish.Thanks.
Not much that I can say other than the price of these is much better on Amazon so I get them here. The product works great and keeps my razor in top condition. The only thing I have noticed is that once a razor is a few years old I think the product starts to wear the painting / coating on the plastic. Mine razor has started to discolor a little as well as bubble / peel near the area the cleaner hits. Really this is a non-issue, most razors I have had that cost well over $200 dont even seem to last that long, just figured I would mention it. Not much you can do really, you have to clean the razors and these cartridges are what most require in some form.
I purchased my Bruan shaver with clean system about 8 years ago.  I use to be able to go to Walmart and purchase the refills, but here lately Walmart has not had them in stock.  So I had to go online to find them and of course Amazon did.  Not only was the refills cheaper, but instead of getting a 2 refill pack I was able to get a 3 refill pack cheaper than what Walmart sold with only 2 in their package.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who own a Braun shaver with a cleaning system.
I prefer this ear thermometer to my other one. The need for a lens filter may turn off some buyers, but I like it for the fact that they keep the lens clean and ready to use. The case the thermometer snaps into holds the filters for easy to reach convenience.The thermometer gets accurate readings quickly and easily. It only takes a second. My other ear thermometer took longer and I could never aim it just right. The other one also doesn't have a lens filter, which made it more inconvenient because I always had to make sure it was clean and then hunt down the alcohol to clean it with.This thermometer is tops in my book. I highly recommend it.
I have a number of Homedics products from the full body massager to handheld, to a neck thing and love all of them.  They are great.  While at Goodwill on $1 Thursdays, I picked up this foot massager for $1.  It works great.  All the good and bad stuff about this from the reviews - it vibrates too much, moves all over the floor, etc.  Yes, it does all those.The heat works great.  The vibration works great, though, I would keep the vibration thing on for probably more than 5-10 min.  I feel my whole body vibrating.  Anyway, I keep this under my desk with a big towel under it to keep it from slipping too much.  For $1?  I couldn't even get a $1 burger from McDonald's for less expensive.Great buy and find for me.
For the price, this product isn't that bad, but don't expect too much from it.  The "massage" basically amounts to it vibrating a lot, which can feel somewhat nice, but not as much as I had expected.  As a runner, I've tried many different foot massagers and this one is on the slightly below average end.  The unit also doesn't put off much heat at all.  You can get more heat from sticking your feet near a light bulb.However, being able to control the product with my toes was fairly nice, and I do use it occasionally.  I just don't think it should have been labeled as a"Pro Ultra."  There's nothing really "ultra" about it.
I used to stay in hotels 4 nights of the week when working out of town. Nothing worse for good sleep than noise, a strange place, and jetlag. If you get a smoking room or a stale-smelling room, it can be really be pretty bad. I used to put the television on a non-channel for the white noise (blocks traffic, elevators and voices a bit) and burn scented candles for the odors.The Homedics device is a lot better than burning a candle and having the TV on all night. I love the woodlands sounds and aromatherapy sure works for me (and certainly gets rid of that &quot;hotel&quot; smell as well.)If you travel or know someone who has to be on the road, this is a great thing to take with. And if you have a fussy baby, sometimes it can help (although I lent one recently to a friend with a colicky kid but he still preferred to be in a car, driven round and round and round and....)
Aleve helps me for my back pain but doesn't seem to help with most common everyday things like headaches.I alternate between Tyenol and Aleve. When one stops working, I switch back to the other. This is just about the same as Tyenol. Aleve may be a little bit better but it is more expensive.I would recommend this if you take Tyenol and it has stopped helping because your body has become adjusted to it. Aleve seems to be harder on the stomach so be sure to take with food.Another reviewer said it helped with her menstrual pains but it doesn't help me with mine. This does help me better than Tyenol with lower back pain.
I use this for everything; back pain, sore muscles, sprains, it works great on them all! It doesn't smell great, but not any worse than icy hot or something like that and you don't have to get it all over your hands to apply it. It feels sort of cool when you put it on, but warms up a la icy hot after a bit...but it really does help the soreness go away! I carry it in my purse for those moments when my back acts up and I need instant relief- definitely a great buy!
The relief from pain in my feet and in my lower back comes after a few minutes of applying. It does has a medicine smell, but is not near as strong of a smell as most sports creams and ice/heat rubs. The 4 oz. bottle of Absorbine will last you a long time even with daily use. The defect I find is in the foam applicator, which causes too much to come out and run. I have to be careful when applying to my lower back or it easily can run down my buttcrack, which feels like hot lava.
I didn't find that this worked very well for my arthritis (osteo), but it DOES work wonderfully on mosquito bites, especially if you use it on the bites as soon as you notice them. To me, it's worth it's weight in gold for just that reason. I purchasedAbsorbine Jr Pain Relieving Liquid, Original, with No-Mess Applicator - 4 fl oz, then theAbsorbine Jr Pain Relieving Liquid, Original - 16 fl ozto refill the bottle. I will purchase again next summer when those pesky critters come back.My husband doesn't like the smell, but I don't mind it at all ... and I don't care since it works!  :D
I bought this product today because it was recommended by my mother.  I got a spider bite on my temple and it caused quite a bit of swelling. So much that I couldn't wear my glasses because the head of the bit where the venom comes out was right where the band rides on my glasses.  The bite was causing pain and the Absorbine Jr. has helped.  It stings a bit on the wound but that is followed by relief and the relief lasted for a couple hours.My mom uses it for mosquito bites and says it's really good stuff.  I have to agree.
Its pretty good, its a lot like icy hot.  I guess I thought it would be stronger though.  Im using it on a sprained neck thats very painful so I didnt expect it to knock this kind of pain out completely but it helps ease the tension a bit.  My only complaint is it REALLY stinks.  Someone across the room from me at work asked me if I was eating a tunafish sandwich..lol.  It smells like tuna and kinda like rubber a little.  The smell makes me nausea after 3 days of use.  I never want to smell it again if my neck EVER heals...
Absorbine Jr. is one of best "old fashioned", now, sadly little known products on market.I do use several "legacy" type products still including Absorbine Jr, Cornhusker's LotionPfizer Consumer Healthcare Corn Huskers Lotion 7 Oz&Corn Huskers Heavy Duty Oil-Free Hand Treatment Lotion 7 fl oz (207 ml)and Bag BalmBag Balm Antiseptic, 10 ozWhile not quite as effective on muscle aches to me as some other products like Icy Hot, it is still good and is fantastic on athlete's foot problems (burns like hades, but clears up mine in 2-3 days) and works extremely well on insect bites and plant sticker punctures and irritations.  Kids may howl and complain as it can BURN on broken skin / abrasions, but it works better than most of today's fancy (and expensive) products and does not have an perfumes or fragrances added.  It acts, works and SMELLS like a "medicine".
Several years ago my dermatologist recommended Zeasorb and I have been using it ever since.  It has become more a necessity now due to my weight gain following radiation and chemo treatment for late-stage cancer.  The powder is helpful in keeping the moist areas of my skin as dry as possible and free from itch.  The 2.5 oz. size being sold now is probably as a result of TSA's size requirements.  I was used to buying the 11.5 oz. size in the past.  The 2.5 oz. size is more convenient for travel.
The only reason I am giving this 4 stars is because the product label is misleading.  It's just not for athlete's foot, it's also good for jock itch.  My derm told me that there's no difference between this powder and the one that's labeled &#34;jock itch&#34;.  It's deceiving because the prices are different, whether intentionally or not, it does not matter, consumers shouldn't have to deal with the confusion.  This product gets the job done quickly and easily.  I can't find a better medical powder out there.
I have hot air heating and it dries things out in the winner. Before I started using this product, I would wake up with very dry mucus in my nose, and if I blow my nose the mucus was bloody.I have tried several approach to reduce the dryness.Ayr Gel put inside the nostril before sleep really did the job. I also use Ayr SalineAyr Saline Nasal Mist, 1.69-Ounce Spray Bottles (Pack of 6)during the day if I feel a bit dry.Ayr Gel inside the nostril works better then room humidifiers which did not solve my problem and cleaning them was a lot of work.  I don't have any tingling or any other feeling. It has no odor.  My nose just feels moist and fresh. It is also reasonably priced compared to other products.Ali Julia review
Very good product would recommend just ordering with Christmas rush all types of packages in the mail. My order came in a envelope manila that is with small boxes of gel inside. Two boxes were crushed on one side. Took the other two out and cleaned them up. Contacted Ayr and they wanted pictures of crushed boxes that were in the trash. They stated in a email that they were sorry and would replace ASAP. HAS BEEN OVER TWO WEEKS AGO. They know Amazon is reading there response so they make it look great in guess. Would NOT ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN.
I have chronic anemia and am periodically on oxygen, and have developed nearly daily nosebleeds. My hematologist gave me a sample of Ayr because I was in so much pain from the cracking and irritation, I could hardly touch my nose. After a few days using it, my nostrils were actually *flexible* without being too painful again! I still get nosebleeds but if I keep up with using the Ayr as needed, I don't have the burning dryness, it doesn't hurt to touch the sides of my nose and I can blow my nose (believe me, that's an achievement).I purchased theAyr Saline Nasal Gel Moisturizing Swabs With Soothing Aloe, 20-Count Swabsto tuck in my purse when I'm out, since this is Wisconsin and it's drier than a bone here in the winter.This is better than the entire pile of saline-only mists, treatments and sprays I've been advised to use.
As my husband and I have gotten older we have had increasing nasal dryness during the winter.  For a few years we have been using Boroleum at bedtime.  The Boroleum is quite helpful -- but it is viscous and smells awful.  It is basically petrolatum and camphor.  Really do not want to be using it during the day.  My husband discovered this Ayr saline nasal gel -- it is very light, liquid, and unscented.  We find we need to use it several times a day but it has become indispensable.  If I forget to reapply it my nose quickly becomes dry and painful.  It almost doesn't seem possible that this simple and inexpensive salve could work so well.  We have bought so many tubes of this and it is now one of our subscribe and save items.  We are always stocking several tubes as we never want to run out of it.
This was a multi-box deal. The expiration was far enough away in years that I will easily use them all. I suffer from dry bleeding sinuses in the winter. My doctor recommended vasaline; that was a one time nightmare. I tried a generic of this from CVS and liked it, and then found this product for less than the generic. It helps ease the pain of dry nasal passages, help stop the nasal prescription spray from giving me nose bleeds, and coupled with netti pot, saline rinse, and two vaporizers, my nose has been happy and sinus infection free for two months. I will buy more for sure!
It's so soothing to the insides of my nose. Some types of weather makes my nose very dry and the AYR helps a lot. When my nose get too dry it might bleed when I blow it but because of the AYR it doesn't bleed as often, The only thing is that you will need Q-tips to apply the AYR. You could use your fingers but I wouldn't. You never know what's under them, no matter how much you wash your hands. I would recommend this to any one with this problem.
I have been using Ayr Nasal Gel for the past two years at bed time and have found that it keeps my nasal passages open throughout the night and it has eliminated the stuffiness I had before discovering this product.  I buy it in quantity from Amazon and save substantially from retail pharmacy's.  I can't recommend it more highly, especially after this winter.  Since it has been unseasonably cold making keeping adequate humidity in the home next to impossible with humidifiers and even warm mist vaporizors. Ayr Nasal Gel has provided relief that otherwise would of made my sleeping through the night extremely difficult. A small amount at the bottom of each nostril is all one needs to use and a tube will last for a reasonable time making it a cost effective means verses nasal strips.
If you live in an arid area of the country and are prone to nosebleeds, this is just the ticket. It is a pleasant gel that keeps your nasal tissues from drying out and bleeding. The person I bought this for had massive hemorrhages and was usually far from medical help. Since she started using this, not a single nosebleed. When she can't get to "the big city" drug stores, I know I can always depend on Amazon to back her up.This product comes in fine spray, gel spray, and gel tubes. I prefer the two later items myself, but even the fine spray or a saline spray helps.
During Utah's dry winters, I experience daily nose bleeds.  I've tried saline nose spray and humidifiers.  After a particulary bad nose bleed lasting almost 24 hours, I researched other treatments.  I had nothing to loose from trying the Ayr gel.  THIS STUFF WORKS!  I haven't had nose bleeds since using the product.  I wish I would have known about it years ago.  But two instructions for best success:1.  Put the get on the tip of the finger (not the bottom) and rub it all around INSIDE the nose & up as high as you can get it. (make sure your fingernail is cut short).2.  Look at your nose in the mirror about an hour later - sometimes there will be white stuff visible.  You want to make sure you don't gross people out.3.  I have to use the product twice daily to prevent all bleeds.This product changed my life; no more daily bleeds!
In the past our ENT recommended we use Ayr Saline Nasal Gel.  Our ENT said the Ayr gel would keep our noses from getting overly dry.  He said this would help prevent us from getting so many sinus infections.  He also suggested we each use a Neti Pot and saline solution.  As the doctor pointed out, you can keep Ayr gel with you at all times, but you cannot always keep a Neti Pot with you.I don't know why, but we sneeze almost each time we apply the Ayr gel.  The sneezing last for a few seconds and then the sneezing stops.  The Ayr gel moisturizes our nasal cavities, which helps us to have fewer nosebleeds.Amazon and Wal Mart charge the same price for the Ayr gel, but when we go to Wal Mart, they are often out of stock.  I was glad to find it here at Amazon.  When I bought it from Amazon, Amazon had temporarily lowered their price.
I have hot air heating and it dries things out in the winner. Before I thought of using saline nasal sprays, I would wake up with very dry mucus in my nose, and if I blow my nose the mucus was bloody.I have tried several approach to reduce the dryness.Ayr Saline Mist and Ayr GelAyr Saline Nasal Gel, With Soothing Aloe, 0.5-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)put inside the nostril before sleep really did the job. I use Mist during the day, and gel before going to bed.I have tried several saline mists, and I like Ayr the best for several reasons:1. the size of the bottle is convenient not too larger other other optins2. it squeezes well, delivering consistent spray every time3. it has no odor and does not leave an after taste4. i had no negative reaction to the spray, and the nose felt refreshed and moist5. it is reasonably priced (e.g. half of the price the Simply Saline providing the same results)
I ordered this when I couldn't find the 4-Way saline spray at a decent price.These probably work well for you if you want to use them as drops or dont mind a stream type delivery.I dont like the feel of the stream compared to the mist type so I probably wouldn't order again for that reason.I had trouble with it dripping from my nose as I was squeezing the bottle where as the mist type doesnt do this.Since I dont like leaning my head back to use nasal spray its not a good product for me personally.The product itself is fine overall.I dont like the longer,skinny tip compared to the short,wider,type on the 4-Way.Very good price for six large bottles though.
I suffer from year round allergies with nasal congestion constantly. This saline mist is the best I have tried. It is not drying like the others. The spray bottle is easy to use and gives off a nice mist spray, not alot of fluid just to run back out your nose. I have purchased other spray bottles that were so hateful to use such as the spray hole too small, or the bottle loses it's shape making it hard to squeeze, etc. This mist does the job I need it to to moisten and help clear my nose..sorry gross. Great price here at Amazon also, I'll be buying it again.
I bought these in a pack of 6 using Amazon Prime and considered it a great deal.  I need saline spray after having a septoplasty 4 weeks ago and this saline rinse fits the bill.The shape of the bottle and the nozzle are better engineered than Ocean (in my opinion).  This bottle provides a nice, gentle spray.  Great stuff and very good at moisturizing the mucosa.  Does what it was meant to do.I used this heavily after a septoplasty surgery and also imagine it would be good for those using a CPAP machine dealing with dry noses.  I prefer this over Ocean and some of the other saline sprays because the bottle format is actually nice and delivers a very consistent mist of saline.  The "fatter" ocean bottles always feel like they get squeezed in the middle and become more difficult to use as the bottle gets emptier.I like this brand the best -- great stuff!
I haven't even received this yet, but I've used it years ago for warding off sinus infections and colds. It washes out germs from your sinuses and is very soothing if you already have a problem that started. Helps heal the sinuses. I also use 8 oz. heated filtered water with a quarter teaspoon sea salt dissolved in water and pour it down my sinuses over the sink which works, too. But this in a bottle is more convenient and an excellent price and a huge quantity so you don't have to buy for a long time.
For some years I've had repeated sinus infections.  Then two years ago a new ENT Specialist recommended that I use Saline Nasal Mist on a frequent basis (several times during the day & once or twice during the night) most especially in the wintertime. (We already had a new humidifier on our furnace.)Happily this has made a significant difference for me since I've followed his directive.  I've only had one sinus infection in the following two years & my night time and early morning stuffiness are minimal so I am sleeping much better & arising without headaches which happened almost daily before.Since this is a saline nasal spray, it can be used daily & indefinitely & costs little (instead of the other expensive..some over $100 a small bottle... prescription drugs) and this great OTC spray surely does the "job" for me!
For someone who always has had troubles with her sinuses, I'm a big fan of nasal sprays.  For some reason, I can not get used to a Netti pot, just the sensation of water makes me gag immediately.  I've tried a lot of sprays, and my past favorite Rhinaris is wonderful, but expensive.  Plus, often it would get a little stale and smelled almost to a point of curdled milk if left unused for a while.  I like Ayr because of a low price on amazon.And here's a great tip, if you take care of the bottle and rinse the tip under hot water after every use [as per directions], it never gets stale, always fresh smelling, which really means no smell at all.  I usually do 3 sprays in each nostril, which I find does a fine job.
.Recently I have been on oxygen most of each day.  Although the oxygen helps the condition for which it was prescribed, it drys my nasal membranes.  So I get frequent nosebleeds.  Sometimes the nosebleeds cut off access to the oxygen.One of my therapists suggested I try Ayr products.  I found that Ayr produces a gel, nose drops, and a mist.  I decided upon the mist.Ayr Saline Nasal Mist is very helpful.  When my nose begins to bleed I spray the mist into my nose and it stops the bleeding.  My doctor explained that the sodium chloride in the mist helps form blood clots.I recommend Ayr Saline Nasal Mist for anyone struggling with nosebleeds.
After my five year old started suffering really bad allergies this spring I used children's Zyrtec. It worked but made my son feel "weird" and he didn't like it. So I tried Clariton but it did nothing. So I search for something that didn't have side effects and found this. I was drawn to it by the good reviews I found all over the web. Well after 2 days of use my son is allergy free! I can't believe it and I'm so happy! I'm thinking about switching myself from my Rx steroid spray.It's such a happy moment when you find something that works and it safe.If you suffer or know someone that does, please try this product. It rocks!
What a great little design that fits into your pocket just like a chapstick. No matter how stuffy I get, those Vicks vapors clear me right up allowing me to use my nasal spray to keep the airways clear. There are two things you should definitely avoid with this product. First, you should not over use the inhaler, as it will cause nasal irritation. Second, you should store the inhaler at room temperature because if it gets too hot the vapors will be stronger and also cause nasal irritation. The only other concern is that this product has an ingredient that will show up as an amphetamine on a drug test. So, you should keep the card with you if your boss gives you a drug test. If you follow these guidelines, then you'll see this product is a real lifesaver when you're all stuffed up.
This is a product that is intended to cure/treat an illness/disease, and HAS NOT BEEN PROVEN TO BE SAFE OR EFFECTIVE BY THE FDA!  *** ALL *** of these foreign medications/foods being sold on Amazon are ILLEGAL ...  Where are you Amazon?  This is a crime.This is a medication made by India (or wherever) for India (or wherever), IT IS NOT ALLOWED TO BE SOLD IN THE USA!  Wake up people - you have no idea of the conditions in developing countries, no idea of the quality of their source materials, their hygiene, their regulatory enforcement, etc.  I was almost killed by a substituted medication from Mexico.  Don't be an idiot.  If you wouldn't allow a stranger to inject you with a syringe containing an unknown substance, don't eat/inhale unknown substances either, because it is no different than being injected.
Thanks to this little stick, I don't have to fight with my gag reflex due to the horrific smells of my fellow airline passengers who fart up a storm as we fly across the oceans and lands of our vast planet. Out of pure necessity did I buy this product and 10 years later I still never travel without it. I've never used it for anything other than keeping offensive odors away from my nasal passages.I'd rather spray the offenders with Lysol but since that's no longer chic or eco friendly, this little gem works amazingly well. Plus, the Vapo Inhaler is US TSA friendly.
Decongestant pills deliver the drug to your whole body, so they can cause side effects in your whole body. This inhaler delivers the drug straight to your nose, just where you want it. I find these inhalers more effective than pills, much faster, and with fewer side effects.Decongestant pills usually contain pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine, both of which are stimulants - basically speed. I have tried pseudoephedrine pills and I find they cause insomnia and anxiety. I have not even tried phenylephrine pills. Decongestant pills tend to increase heart rate and blood pressure, and can cause chest pain (angina) in some people. A closely related decongestant, phenylpropanolamine (PPA), was withdrawn from the US market because it caused stroke. However, it should be noted that the stroke victims were generally taking very high doses as a weight-loss aid, they were not using decongestant doses.This inhaler contains a very similar stimulant drug, but the dose is very low and it stays mostly in your nose.
I had a Cold and I couldn't breathe my nose was all stuffed up so I order Vicks Vapor Inhaler, for some reason there are no where to be found where I live, It arrived in just two days, Amazing, with the Vicks Vapors you get instant relief, in just a matter of seconds my nose cleared up real good. One of the best over-the-counter Medicine for Sinus Congestion that really works, I have used it for years. I decided to order another one and for some reason I'm still waiting for it and it's been over a month, I think everyone had the same Idea! ...Thank You D.D.
I sweat if it's hot or cold!!! This is the only thing that works for me!!!!! I HAVE TOLD ALL MY FRIENDS!!!! Buy this!!! Just DO NOT use after a shower when you have shaved your arm pits it will bun you. At first it does tingle with applications but after a while your skin gets use to it. I did have a rash/burn looking after first application. But using it when I did not just come out of the shower and/or shaving it works best!
Purchased this for my adult son who has excess sweating; he was so grateful; "He was like Mom it really does work, thank you!"  Sometimes moms have to research products for adult children as they are where we were years ago, raising young children, working and just don't have the time to get helpful information that will solve their problems.  Anyway, it worked for him...Be sure that whom ever uses this product, that the directions are read carefully as it is not to be used like a deodorant.1. Use at night before bed (do this twice in a row)2. Then use every other nightDon't quote me verbatim, just read the direction for yourself before using, as I'm sure you would like to get the best use from this product.  If it does not work for you see your physician for a stronger version of this product...Good Luck!
when i was in high school, i perspired excessively. it was so embarrassing. i always had huge wet spots under my arms. i saw a commercial for certain-dri and i decided to give it a try since normal anti-perspirants didn't seem to help at all. after using certain-dri for a few months, my problem was gone. then i tapered off my use and only used it once a month or so. i haven't used it in a few years now and i don't sweat under my armpits any more unless i am working out. i recommended this product to my sister, who was in her late 30's, and she had the same results. i'm not sure how it works, but it definitely does the job!
I've spent soooooo much money on other products that never helped me :(This actually works!!! I was actually checking in the mirror through out the day to see if I found any sweat & it was completely dry, even after being outside & sweating my underarm area was DrY!!!!! It's watery when putting it on but dries pretty fast & may itch a little at first but it goes away. Trust me if you have embarrassing sweating arm pit stains on your shirt this is Worth it!!! Wish I would have know about it along time ago. But happy to finally find one that keeps me DRY!!! :)
I saw a TV commercial for this. I thought it wouldn't work so I got it from Walmart so I could easily take it back if it didn't.  IT WORKED.  Now I'm getting it from Amazon after this bottle runs out.It's not that it hides odor any better, it's that it stops wetness better.It's no secret about the aluminum ingredients.  The only thing keeping the mainstream deodorant makers form using the same ingredients is controversy over the effects of aluminum absorption into the system.
I sweat a lot, for no reason! I was limited to wearing black or white shirts because of the constant wet pit stains. Someone recommended this to me, and I'm so glad I bought it. It's really been a miracle product! I've tried those "clinical strength" antiperspirants, and they do help a little, but nothing like this. I absolutely cannot believe how effective it is, even on my "faucet pits!" I was nervous just applying it at bedtime and nothing in the morning, but I followed the directions diligently and it did what it said it would! And no BO during the day either! My ONLY small complaint is that it made my pits extremely itchy for the first few nights I used it, but that stopped after about 4-5 days. I swear it seals your pits shuts. I will never buy a different antiperspirant!
Works but hurts and itches like crazy when you put it on after shaving.  I purchased for wedding as this issue was a big concern for me.  Shaved on Thursday pm in preparation for rehearsal dinner on Friday (since I knew I wouldn't have time to shave on Friday with a huge to-do list), used deodorant on Friday night prior to wedding day.  However, still used another light layer of different kind (a roll-on) over it and had no issues whatsoever the next day.  No, wiping off on his tux or anything.  This was all a HUGE concern of mine too. Everything went perfectly and I didn't have to think about if I smelled or anything at all that day.
1. I was scared that it would sting so badly, and no it's totally bearable and it will go away in a matter of few minutes.2. I once used it all over my body (pits, back, chest), and that was a hot day! And I did sweat a bit, but 90-95% of the sweats were eliminated.NOTE: DON'T use it on large area, not only it will sting really bad the night you apply it, the next day whenever your body trying to sweat it will sting too! BUT if you just use it for underarm alone, everything's fine.3. It lasts for approx. 2-3 days before you'll have to reapply it. Once I used a lot (and by a lot I mean A LOT), it stayed effective for over 5 days!!!4. Instead of rolling it directly to your underarm, you should roll it on your palm, and apply it with your palm so that it won't drip.
If you have profuse sweating problems, thank the lord, because your problems are over. One swath of this under each arm and you can kiss those sweat rings good-bye. Ok, you won't want to do that, but if you have had that problem for as many years as I have, you may actually do it.The bottle says to use only on underarms, I advise that you follow that. However, I put some on my forehead every couple of days to keep those bothersome sweat beads out of my eyes (I wish I had bushy eyebrows). I have noticed an increase in perspiration on other parts of my body, especially while sleeping, but that is a small price to pay for the benefits.
This is an amazing product. I've went through multiple brands, even tried all sorts of Secret, but nothing worked for me. I don't usually sweat unless I'm nervous. After trying Certain Dri Roll-On, I got rid of everything else I had. This thing is amazing, and you do not need to use it daily. Just apply once every 4-6 days depending on how often you need it. I apply it about once a week. It dries quickly and leaves no stains. Be sure NOT to use it after you have shaven or if you have extra sensitive skin as it could irritate. You can use the solid version if you have sensitive skin. Don't forget to get the A.M. Certain Dri as it gives a refreshing smell for the morning.
For years now, I pretty much had to stick to black shirts since I sweat so much.  A quick Google search turned me on to Certain Dri, so I bought some and gave it a whack.  I put it on every night for 3 nights in a row.  Now I only put it on every 2 or 3 nights, and I have been getting great results!  I switched from using your standard antiperspirants, to a combination of this and regular deodorant.  My white undershirts aren't suffering from the nasty yellow pit-stains that normal antiperspirants cause, and I'm able to wear other shirts now without worrying about having wet armpits. We've had a hot May, and so far June here in Detroit...  I've only had minimal issues with sweat, even when it hits the upper 80's and 90's!  This stuff also seems to work well, even when working out or running!
Finally, a solution to damp pits!  I previously had horrendous sweating, and had to change anti-perspirants almost weekly.  Nothing had ever worked.  Now, I can put this on once a week, and use my regular stuff daily.  It actually works, and I haven't had a single instance of wet pits since I started using it.  I'm blown away that it took me so long to find this!It does sting a bit at night when you apply it, but it is absolutely worth it for the results.
Tried it for a week and it did nothing. Followed the directions exactly...nothing. Tried applying twice a day...nothing. By the third day I was getting severe irritation. By the fourth day I had what looked like abrasive burns under my arms. This was all with following the direction and then, when it didn't work, the suggestions given by other users of the product such as waiting until fully dry after a shower, only applying before bed as per the directions, applying lightly the first time and more the second application the next night, etc. etc. etc.. I didn't get any noticeable reduction in sweating and now I have chafed pits. Moving on to another product.
If you're looking for a product that is both inexpensive and works well, this is it. It does exactly what it says it does.It's sort of a longer term solution. If you put it on at night it'll last for up to 72 hours, but for me usually wears off around the second day. Put it on every night, you'll never have a problem with sweating.This isn't scented, so if you're looking for scented stuff- you can use something else to put on in the mornings. This strictly only stops the sweating, and it's good at doing it.
I love Certain Dri. I'm not sure I could get along in life without it. When I first started using Certain Dri over a decade ago, I would use it every day. Then, I dropped down to using it every other day after maybe two or three weeks. Now, I feel I only need to give my underarms a few swipes once a week. This is incredible because I used to sweat like a beast. I mean, just sitting down without moving around would make my underarms sweat profusely. Gross. I don't worry about that anymore. I do wish that the product worked on hands, though. I haven't had any success trying to get it to work on my hands. However, that's not how the product is marketed. It is just wishful thinking.
Skip all those &#34;clinical strength&#34; products that are sold by big name brands and just buy this!Certain Dri has helped me SO much, I don't think I could live without it! Ever since middle school I've had problems with underarm perspiration, but not anymore. I've been using this for maybe 8 years now, I used to apply it every singe night before bed, but now I use it about once every other week and its still working! Listen to the instructions and DO NOT apply it after showering, even if you haven't shaved your underarms, it's so uncomfortable and itchy!I really can't express how much I love this. Even when the rest of my body is soaked in sweat from working out in the hot sun in Florida, my underarms are still dry!
I work out fairly often and have a pretty good physique. I like to wherefairly tight shirts. Before I started using Certain Dri, I generally had to where baggier shirts for fear of wetness. Now I can where them as tight as I want. This stuff is awesome. I put it on every 2nd or 3rd night. On occasion it will itch a little if I put to much on, but not near enough for me to stop using it. I certainly don't recommend using it every night. It wasn't meant to be used that often.
I oversweat notoriously and embarrassingly, none of the OTC products quite cut it and make me go out in confidence, and about 70% of them give me rashes to boot, and Certain Dri proved to be a game-changer.1) It does NOT stop underarm sweating altogether, at least for me, but reduces it so dramatically that your underarms end up staying a lot drier than the rest of your body (sth  I def. Prefer)2) Doesn't cause underarm stains if applied correctly* (read sparingly).3) SAFE on oversensitive skin, again, if applied correctly*.*If you're worried you might've overapplied it, simply wait 30 mins after applying, then using a slightly wet tissue/paper towel, wipe the area application, once. This should clean any excess amount away, and don't worry; it will still work.
I am profuse back sweater and had been using Sweatblock pads with great relief.  However, I wanted to find something easier to apply at less cost.  I assumed since the ingredients were the same that Certain Dri would do the trick.  And it has lots of great reviews.  It's been somewhat of a disappointment.  While I can tell it does prevent some sweating, it doesn't keep me dry to the same extent Sweat block did.  I'll try it a little longer because of the price, but it doesn't do the trick as I had hoped.
The temperature hits one degree above 70 and I sweat like a pig, I drink gallons of water a day.  Thankfully my partner doesn't complain.  Her only complaint is body odor, aka pit stench.  Guess what? If there is no sweat there will be no haven for bacteria and hence no odor. This product works very well for me and has been a godsend.  Now my arm pits are always bone dry.  A little too dry actually,  I usually use a gentle skin lotion in place of daily deodorant.  No complaints from me, my partner or my coworkers.That being said this agitates my sensitive skin a little.  Using every other day helps alleviate that, but it's a worthy price to pay to avoid smelling like a dump and having gross stains all over my expensive shirts.
I wanted to give this roll on a try for a few weeks before I'd jump into a definite conclusion. I've been using Certain Dri for about 8 wks now. I bought it at a local pharmacy, wasn't cheap. I followed the instructions and I gotta say that it only helped for the first few applications. After that I started having irritation, itching, skin staining, clothes discolored and the perspiration was back.I stopped using it for about 2 weeks to see if my body had gotten used to the ingredients and perhaps that made it stop working. But that didn't do it. I still wash 2-3 times a day with antibacterial body wash and wear antiperspirant deodorant. Certain Dri seems a temporary fix for a permanent problem. Won't buy it again, it's just wasting money.
I've recently started feeling the affects of lactose intolerance and it has put a serious damper on my food experiences. Most of the time I just go without any lactase supplements and risk the small amounts of dairy that comes with the meal. However, when I go for lattes or cheesecake I practically inhale these. They work amazingly quickly, allowing you to take two and just have at it right away.I'm also a bit self conscious about my intolerance. These are individually packed and come in pretty small wrappings. I hide some in my pocket for those days out and if I ever need some I can just turn around and quickly take a few. Very convenient and very effecti...OMGBRB ICE CREAM TRUCK!
I have severe lactose intolerance (not an allergy, "just" intolerant) and I usually use the "Ultra" form of this product. However, since I used to be okay with the "Original" strength Lactaid, I thought this might be more economical, even if I had to take multiple tablets. I was wrong. For some reason, these tablets just didn't work for me, even when I took 3 or 4 tablets for something that would be managed by a single "Ultra" tablet.So, if you are really sensitive to dairy products, then you're better off with "Ultra" Lactaid, rather than "Original" Lactaid.
The lactaid product is wonderful for anyone that is lactose intolerant. The lactase supplement helps greatly. But go with the tablets. I bought a box of the chewables, and they are terrible. I take them now just because I paid for a box and want to get my money's worth. And once I finish this box, I will always go with the tabs. Granted, ther are more convenient in a place without water... but at the same time, when would you be eating without any liquid to take it down with? Stick to the tabs, you'll be happier.
man! i wish i knew about this when i was younger! I never knew that there were pills about this to help with lactose intolerance... do you guys know how much i suffered bc of milk when i was young? all that diarrhea? it sucked! One day I was like hmmm what if there are pills we can take for lactose intolerance? And there was! I was eager to try it. I'm partly lactose intolerant and It's not that severe. I only get diarrhea when I eat a lot of dairy but ti's not too bad. I take this whenever I drink milk and it does work. I don't get diarrhea like I use to. Now of course this might not work for you bc everyones body response differently to pills.
Lactose intolerance can be very stressful to deal with. Having to decline food, opportunities to eat because you can't digest is embarrassing and annoying. This solves the problem. Take one with your first bite and you can eat dairy products. It says take another after 45 mins but to be safe I would take it 30 mins after if you continue to eat dairy products.I prefer these to the chewables because I can fit a few in my wallet.If you have an empty stomach, be careful when eating lactose containing foods and drinking lots of liquids at the same time. That is the only time I've ever had issues. I took a bite of bagel with cream cheese and a Lactaid and then chugged a bottle of water, needless to say the Lactaid wasn't able to work very well in my empty stomach filled with water and a bit of cream cheese, my stomach was very upset.I drink the Lactaid milk all the time as well - I really like the whole milk.Great products.
I love ice cream & other dairy products but unfortunately, these pills are the only way I can enjoy them.I've also been recently diagnosed w/ extreme iron overload (I guess having steak everyday for lunch & dinner wasn't a good thing :)), So, now I try to drink milk w/ every meal (esp. if meat is involved). At home, it's no problem since I have access to Lactose-free milk, but at restaurants, you don't have that option so Lactaid pills to the rescue!
Lactaid Fast Act Lactase Enzyme Supplement, Chewable Tablet, Vanilla Twist 60 ea...but of medical necessity.  Lataid Fast Act and all that preceded it are and were essential to my physical well-being.  Lactaid always did its job as long as I did mine, which means, follow the directions and take the product with the first bite of anything dairy (in my case.)I would never hesitate to recommend Lactaid products to others.  I am certain that your results will be equally satisfactory, unless your need is due to another medical problem, in which case I can't say.  Now, go eat a great big ice cream cone, a bagel slathered with cream cheese, a large bowl of cereal (with your Lactaid milk, of course,)and a plate full of macaroni and cheese, and hum your way through each bite.  (For this feast of four items, three of which do not contain Lactaid from another source, you will want to take one pill for each.)
The National Brand of the best working Lactase Tablets - they get the job done--i.e. preventing embarassing dashes for the nearest lavatory, which can be a pain if you're taking the train, particularly as it tends to be rather drafty in there and on cold mornings any trip where one has to run down a long series of connecting cars just to partially disrobe to read a newspaper and pretend that's all you went there for- which allows you to be comfortable and not have to make the weaving sway-bumping into others -as you fairly leap down the cars to the necessary--only to find it &#34;occupied&#34; - is a good thing to have on hand to use instead- make sure you take it WITH the dairy product - not after and not more than 1 minute before eating ...(heed my advice on this -or- don't say i didn't warn you).
My mom has Type 2 diabetics. She began to start throwing up. The doctor confirmed that it was what we thought. She was lactoss intolerant. We greatly reduced the milk products she takes (i.e., milk, cheese, etc.) and had her take one of these pills before each meal. It worked wonders! And the cost when you subcribe to delivery! CVS charged me about $8.82 for just 32 pills. Now I can get 60 for $12.12 (I think that was the new price since they just went up slightly.) Well worth it folks. Highly recommend. And my mom's sugar as dropped so much her diabetic medicine has been reduced! I never knew that milk had natural sugar in it.
I'm lucky, these are "cheap" and work great for me; I eat a lot of dairy!I usually eat between one and three with my first bites of dairy, occasionally I've made a mistake and taken after, never have had a problem, knock on wood -funny thing, I live on a dairy farm, and I can drink our raw milk just fine. I need lactaid to eat our aged cheeses and pasteurized milk. I have not tried raw milk ice cream, and our yogurt is fine for me, all yogurt is fine for me ...I'm delighted I can buy this through Amazon, hard to get locally ...
These Lactaid tablets work well to prevent lactose intolerance induced disasters. The tablets are packaged in a way that is easy to carry around in your bag, pocket or other portable methods.I can finally enjoy foods with dairy again. I suggest taking one right before your first bite of foods with dairy and then having another in the middle of eating dairy if it is a good amount of food or you have been eating for a while. I'm very cautious so I like to be on the safe side I guess.The tablets are composed of lactase, a naturally made enzyme that people with lactose intolerance lack, so there shouldn't be any side effects to taking "too many" tablets. I would just use common sense and experiment with how many tablets to take when eating various dairy products.
I was taking accutane medication and woke up one morning with my eyes so dry my eyelids were stuck to my eyes.  I could not even open them without putting drops in my eyes first.  It was extremely painful.  For the remainder of my treatment I used this every night and it was a life saver.  My eyes were still sometimes a bit dry but never again had the nightmare of waking up with my eyes sealed shut.This stuff is very thick and is like putting vaseline on your eyes.  You will not be able to read clearly for a few minutes after application.  It is meant only for night use and for that it works well.If this is too thick for you use this instead:[...]Also remember to take fish oil for your dry eyes.  My optometrists noticed a great improvement in my eyes after using fish oil and this product.
I suffer with very very dry eyes. They sting a lot and I frequently have to put drops in them. Recently the drops just weren't doing it for me anymore.... felt like someone glued my eyelids open and sat me in front of an industrialized heavy duty fan. I had to take frequent naps daily just to help with my stinging dry eyes. I got headaches when I read or stared at the computer too long cause of persistent stinging. For my 'Dry eye syndrome' this is the FIRST and ONLY product that has really helped. My eyes are no longer red. They do not burn, they do not dry out quickly.I still use liquid drops but maybe only once of twice daily and this is only because I am afraid my eyes dry out again.This product is worth the money and I highly recommend it.
This sterile eyewash helps my dogs with his dry eye.  Once a friend was putting it in, I asked why do you do that? she said her eye itches ... so I keep a watch on my Westie, Marco Polo and wipe away his 'goop' and use the wash.  I used to use specific drops for dry eye ... but this has the same effect.It's a large bottle that you just tip, don't squeeze and the drop comes out.  Great price compared to the tiny ones.
I have had problems recently with dry eyes (horribly blood shot eyes at one point). I tried a couple brands of eye drops and another recommended by my eye doctor but none provided any real relief. But, this does - yea! Also, good to have on hand for an emergency. I can't fully open my eyes working to keep the small included eye cup from leaking (which it does anyway). So, I looked into buying a larger eye cup. TheEye Wash Cup 1 Countis perfect. It is curved, slightly smaller, is easier to hold, doesn't bend, and so doesn't leak - a highly recommended addition.
The single-use container version (no preservative) of Thera Tears is the only one that gives my dry eyes relief, and I've been using this product for years.  I've tried other products, which irritate my eyes rather than soothe them.  More important to me than the applicator design is the availability and pricing of the single-use container version.  Unfortunately, Walmart and Target (whose pricing was great at only $8.58 per box) recently stopped selling the boxes of single-use containers in their stores.  So, now I'm researching new sources for best pricing and availability.
I've had severe dry eye for 6+years now. I've used preservative-free thera tears this whole time. They started out with a sturdy little vial that had a resealable tip. Now they've extended the tip with a long "neck". When I open the vial it is sometimes still sealed shut. Other times it just squirts everywhere. It's such a waste. Many people are complaining but Advance Research isn't doing a thing about it. I guess we need to log more complaints. E-mail address: info@theratears.com
I have been using another, more viscous, product for quite some time for dry eye. I tried this and liked it as something to use in between, because it is thin enough, it does not blur my vision. However, it is too thin for much protection now that the heat is on in the house, so I use both, alternating them. I have a bone to pick with the makers, though. They designed the little containers (this is preservative free single containers) with a funny grip that often blocks the liquid from coming out, which is very frustrating and not good for use while driving.
I've used TheraTears for years in these handy vials but recently have not been able to find them in the stores. (The vials are far superior to the bottles that contain preservatives that irritate my eyes.) So I was delighted to find them on Amazon and ordered several boxes. They came without the box, just foil packs of vials thrown into a shipping box. Without the individual box there is no way to verify their expiration date. (I'm guessing they were expired or close to it.). I contacted the seller the same day. They sent me a return label WITHOUT the postage paid. I had to pay close to $7.00 to return them. Don't buy these from the First Aid Company.
We buy these for my 89-year-old mother.  It is so much easier than having a little bottle that she cannot get the top off of.We buy them on Amazon.com because we live in a remote area of Montana and shopping is 60 miles one-way away (besides, the prices are up to 40% higher and with Amazon delivering FREE to our door within 48 hours, why go anywhere else?)Anyway, these are the same name brand I have bought elsewhere for a lot more and they are excellent.
I bought these for my infant's first trip to Hawaii. I was freaking out about the plane and travel and yada yada... My daughter was 8 months when I used these but she's bigger than the &#34;typical&#34; 8 month old and these fit her ears fine. She was about 19# when we went to give a reference. She didn't have any trouble taking off or landing. These provide an amount of buffering to noise, similar to a regular ear plug, and this helped while we were on a prop (hopper) plane and to the regular noises of flying. I ended up buying 5 pairs to have on hand. Through the round trip of 4 legs, I used all 5 pairs since 1 fell out into the Netherlands of the airplane floor.
I bought these to try out when I am in public since I suffer from near deafness in one ear and hyperacousis in the other (the body tries to compensate for a loss of one of the senses).  I cannot tolerate noisy restaurants and loud venues like Costco.  These are rubbery tubes surrounded by a spiral (screw-like) rubber.  You can place them into your ear canal and twist to seat them well.  The rubber tubes allow air to escape due to changes in air pressure so your ears do not need to pop.  I cannot use them easily since they still do not fit my abnormally narrow ear canals despite the fact that I am an adult.  Still, I can manage to make them stay for a short time by twisting and twisting and it will help if I am exposed to a loud venue and have difficulty tolerating it.
The reason for this is because of the design. Instead of having a tapered curved sleeve style plug similar to the Etymotic ER20s, these have sharp ridges stab into your ear canal. They feel soft to the finger but in actuality apply more pressure on the ear canal than the standard sleeved style ear plug.  There are four ridges that taper in size and they really do push out on the ear canal as you push them into your ear.  It hurts like crazy.  Curved sleeve tapered earplugs, those ones lay against your ear canal and distribute the pressure across more ear canal surface.  With these all the pressure reside along these sharp ridges.I'm very disappointed in these. I thought they were sized for kids (which they are), they  seem to hurt more .  I know earholes differ greatly from person to person. Mine happen to be about 3/16th of an inch in diameter.  I really can't see any child wearing these comfortably, much less an adult with tiny earholes like myself.
I bought FRER pregnancy tests after two years of using the cheaper Wondfu tests on amazon. I loved the wondfu tests and  left excellent feedback but my third batch I got false positives which was, obviously, heartbreaking. I decided to spend more money and buy these tests instead. Well I got my BFP today and confirmed with a digital EPT brand test as well.  I'm 13 DPO and my period was due in 1-2 days. I did test earlier with these pregnancy tests and all tests were negative until today!! I recommend these tests - accurate and quick/clear results.
I have a 2 year old who still doesn't sleep through the night.  Since I was still nursing and periods weren't SUPER regular I would test around the time I get my period every month just to BE SURE there was no way I was pregnant.  I really felt a calm seeing that negative every month.  Crazy I know.  Well, Feb 4th I got a positive.  A definite positive.  Pretty shocking since we were using protection and I thought it had to be wrong.  I tested and tested and went to the doctor.  It wasn't.  Anyway, I can't believe I got a positive so early.  This test is super sensitive and truly is &#34;a first response&#34;.  Due in October and while I still can't believe I'm having another...this product did the job it was intended to do!  Great price too!  Especially if you subscribe!
I used these exclusively with my first two pregnancies.  Fortunately, it did not take us long to get pregnant, so I did not end up forking over more than the price of one package each time.  For my third (and current) pregnancy, in an effort to save money, I bought the Wondfo tests, and purchased the FRER to confirm the positives that I got from the Wondfo.  Wondfo detected the pregnancy at 9 DPO (6 days before my expected period), and did a good job at tracking the subsequent hormone build-up.  I can't imagine spending the money on FRER if it takes repeated attempts to get pregnant, when there are so many cheaper alternatives out there.  That said, I trust FRER's results, which is why I bought it to confirm the Wondfo results.  As I am rating the product itself (and not the price), It gets 5 stars.
I used First Response for all 3 of my pregnancies. They give you accurate results and early. I just found out I am pregnant with my third and I haven't even missed my period yet. I used the First Response ovulation predictor last month and I had a feeling it was a success. I used 2 of these on Friday the 10th and Saturday the 11th, got 2 lines on both. My conception date was May 31st. Granted I know it's early and things can happen, but the point here is that this pregnancy test gave me accurate results and very early. And everyone knows, false positives are almost impossible. I highly recommend these!!
I ordered these as they are a whole lot cheaper than what they sell in the stores. 3 tests for 11 bucks?! I&#8217;ll take it. They shipped super quick to me which is another plus. The best thing though? I took this test at around 11dpo. Got a faint positive. I went to the lab the next day to get my blood drawn. Came back negative. This test was able to catch a positive before the lab&#8217;s levels could. It was only a qualitative so I don&#8217;t know what exactly my levels were, had to have been lower than 20miu(the lab&#8217;s levels). Had to go back the next week and of course, got a positive. So I&#8217;m pretty impressed with these tests.
It's a shame First Response makes you think your result is accurate 4 days before your period. It is very, VERY rare to be able to get your reading that early.You simply do not have enough hgc in your blood for an at-home test to pick up.From my research, these FRER's are very accurate...but you have to wait til at LEAST 12-14DPO. And this is based on a perfect 28 day cycle with O at CD14research show s Dollar Store tests are also accurate but less sensitive. I would load up on dollar store tests then use these for final proof!Go to fertilityfriend.com and get the proof there that you will probably test negative until about a day before your period.
I was Eager, so I took this test 4 days before we could start saying I'd missed or was late...The faintest of faint lines appeared... a line, is a line and it was a positive line!  My husband was skeptical... so I waited 2 days and took another one... the line was VERY CLEARLY there this time... and we were pregnant. For fun, we tried other leading brands that can detect early... and got a 'Not Pregnant' indicator... so... in my books, First response, is about as FIRST response as you  get... b/c we were infact pregnant :)Goodluck!!!
I bought this on a whim since I was one day late and my body is like clockwork. Imagine my shock when I took two test and one came out positive and the other negative. I was hyperventilating. We were safe but things happen - condoms are not 100% and I was off my pill due to how ill it made me. I made a doc's appointment for blood work and we found out I was never pregnant.... Happy ending - yes. But we are still traumatized, if this was an accurate test a lot of stress could have been avoided.
First, the instructions to use your first morning urine are bad--it's best to test in the evening. If your cycles vary, there aren't enough tests to ensure you catch your surge. I never got a positive on these, and after testing with Wondfo strips (that provide more tests), I came to realize I ovulate later in my cycle. I never would have realized this on these strips, and I probably would have stuck to my initial fear (that I wasn't ovulating) if I had stayed with this brand.
After using and ovulation test for 4 months as well as BBT charting, we went to the Dr. and when I explained to him that my chart &#34;looked&#34; like I had ovulated but my ovulation kit had never turned. He said it was very apparent that I was ovulating and that I needed to use a better quality ovulation kit. I bought this one over the cheaper ones I had been using and it's true. Personally, I would recommend charting first to get an idea of when to ov. test and then only test on the days that are close. These tests say start on day 10 but I don't ovulate until day 18 usually so I don't even bother now until day 14 in my cycle. If you want to save money, I would recommend using these on your &#34;most likely to Ovulate&#34; days and use the cheap ones on the other days.
The first month of trying to get pregnant I used a more expensive clear blue digital test which didn't work properly as I kept getting errors of all sorts. I then got a cheap drug store brand which apparently didn't work either. I immediately ordered this for my next cycle, it was simple and easy to use. After my first try with it, I'm now 8 weeks pregnant. So what can I say, it works.Update 21/10/2013I'm sure it works!My son is now three years old so my husband and I decided we were ready to try again. So of course I turned to first response again, I bought a pack of these and used it for two cycles. They are pretty good so I was able to stretch it over two cycles, and to my surprise I'm pregnant again using these tests after two months.
This is the only ovulation test that works for me.Note: Make sure that you don't test your first pee of the day. Test your second, as long as you only have one or two cups of coffee, or whatever you drink in the morning that's not water. Also, you have to try to wait as close to four hours as you can from your first pee of the day. Then, your reading will be more accurate.Regarding coffee, Google how horribly caffeine is for fertility. A recent study showed that it's not cilia that pushes the egg through the fallopian tube, it's a group of cells that contract the tube and push the egg along. In mice, caffeine inhibited that. The study said that's only one reason they know of now. They know it really affects fertility, but they still don't know the entire reasoning behind it. I digress...
Never got a positive reading with these opks, even though I did with wondfos, and I had a clear rise in BBTs for the four days following the positive reading with wondfo.  These are ridiculously priced compared to wondfos ($2.43 per test versus .40) and didn't work for me!  I would have missed my LH surge if I hadn't also tested with wondfos.  Can't recommend these based on my results.  I highly recommend wondfo opks.Update: Tried using these again this cycle. Clearblue Advanced showed a solid smiley (peak fertility) and wondfo showed a strong positive (test line was darker than the control).  FR still shows a negative. FR apparently isn't very sensitive.  While I think CBs are expensive, they do work far better than FRs for me.  I would have missed 2 LH surges if I'd solely relied on the FRs.
You've been out camping in the woods for 3 days without a shower or a clean change of underwear - and your nether regions are ablaze and itching. Do you cancel your camping trip and ruin everyone's trip? Well, that would be my choice - but then again, you want to commune with nature, too - right? Stick a tube of this in your first aid kit for just such a situation. When parts are itching non-stop, it's hard to think straight, much less enjoy yourself doing anything - sleeping, eating, driving, etc.  The Maximum Strength formula helps to extinguish the flames of pain coming from your... uh... parts until you can get back to civilization and/or a trip to your doctor to make sure you didn't accidentally wipe with poison ivy leaves while camping.
I already raved somewhere about these.... they are JUST AMAZING and so far can't seem to find anything betterdon't like pills so these are very thin and compared to regular ones are night and day and they don't smell after like Trojans...you get used to how they look...but again, we disagree on the smell. I don't smell them but my other half does.these are the best we've tried so far! just amazing! ....they're hard to open but totally worth the price and the effort. He loves them, definately the best out there that we've tried. They're not slimy....will order again!
Pros: I hate condoms, and I love these. They are a little weird when you first open them up, if you don't know what to expect. Honestly, the smell is pleasant, and reminds me of kind of a leathery fruity woodsy smell. They are a little roomy when they get warmed up, which adds to the feeling of there not being anything there. For a while, I was just certain they would break at any moment because I figured an animal membrane couldn't possibly be that strong, but they are super tough. Fill one up with water and you will see what I'm talking about. I went off hormonal birth control a while ago, and have been using these instead. Again, they don't protect against STDs and should not be used by anyone but monogamous couples. Best condoms ever!Con: expensive, but I honestly would pay more for them if I had to.
I cut myself rather nastily at a friend's house and he gave me one of these.  They seal tightly and absorb blood and fluids to allow natural healing.  You just put the bandage on and leave it; no changing dressings.  Although they're expensive on a per-each basis, because you don't change dressings, they may be less expensive than fabric or plastic bandages per injury.  I bought some for car, home, and suitcase, so I'll have one wherever I might need it.
It's going to take me quite a while to use all 150 Band-Aids in the 3-pack, but I'll be ordering more as soon as I'm running low!At only a few cents per Band-Aid, I feel totally alright putting them on EVERYTHING.  Depending on your skin tone, these things can be practically invisible after you apply them.  They have decent sticking power (though not as strong as theBand-Aid Brand Adhesive Bandages, Flexible Fabric, 30 Count (Pack of 2)) and they're perfect for the most common sorts of minor injuries.
I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes, I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands, but go through them like water, because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge, very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly, but I will likely purchase another box, just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75" x 4"120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1" x 3"40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75" x 3"82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625" x 2.25"30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875" x .875"
While there is nothing wrong with the product, I am APPALLED by the magnitude of over-pricing on Band-Aid branded bandages. I am not blaming the retailers. I have also noticed that Band-Aid seems to be &#34;eliminating&#34; competing generic offerings, especially if they are in similarly sized boxes.Right after I received this I found packages of generic bandages with 100 total strips of assorted sizes at Walmart for 88 cents. That's $0.88! I checked several Walmarts BEFORE I ordered Band-Aid, but there was no better generic offerings, it was only AFTER ordering that I found them.Nonetheless, I don't have a &#34;good reason&#34; to return these (oh, I would, if I could, but it's not the seller's fault, so I don't want to make them take losses on S&H;), but I will be avoiding Band-Aid brand with even more resolve now.
I have an irritated spot on my face where my CPAP mask presses too hard, and no matter how I adjust it, it still gouges that spot. Band-Aid Clear Spots help a lot, and I use a fresh one every night. The Clear Spots are also very helpful for little cuts and scrapes where a regular-sized Band-Aid would be overkill. I've been buying these in a local pharmacy, but when I saw the 3-pack (150 total) for only a couple of dollars more than I was paying for one box of 50 at the pharmacy, I was sold.The Clear Spots are a very helpful product at a very reasonable price, and I'm very pleased with the deal.
First of all, let me say that whenever I tried a brand other than "Band-aid" I was disappointed.  That said, I believe this particular style is the best I have found.  When I was having a lot of trouble with eczema on my right hand, I needed to wear band-aids on two of my fingers, to protect them so they would heal.  All the other bandaids either had fabric that began to unravel almost immediately or the cushion area was too small or the length of the bandaid was too short.  This one is just right. The whole bandaid is 2 7/8 inches long.  The cushion part is a quilted 1 inch by 1 inch square and has a nice thickness to it.  Also, the actual fabric of the bandaid is a sort of rubber-plastic, so it does not unravel and it stays on pretty well.  It is water resistant.  Buy this one for your general use.  You will probably save money in the long run.
I couldn't bring myself to count all 280 bandages in each of the two packs of Band-Aid Brand Adhesive Bandages I ordered, but I did confirm that all stated sizes were in each box in what appears to be the correct distribution. This is a heck of a lot of bandages, but I have two sons and I like to be prepared. I will re-stock our auto and personal first aid kits from these large boxes as needed. I did not carefully compare prices for these, and I suspect a local Costco or BJ's might have better per-bandage prices, but this was a painless way to stock my medicine chest.
First, you don't buy specialized bandages like this very often. I think the last pack lasted well over five years.But these new ones, yikes! The adhesive - able to stick for days (thru showers), the breathe-ability of the flexible and comfortable material, the ability of this tiny bandaid to apply pressure when needed. Latex-free and hypoallergenic (I've had bad reactions to the adhesive in bandaids, not just the latex). This stuff blows away other (more recent) models of bandaids in my medicine cabinet.It reminds me more of surgical tape with a gauze pad fixed to it. Except my surgical tape isn't this quality.Where can I find this stuff in other sizes?
With our large family and all of us doing lots of sports - ok, the kids do sports and I'm just a klutz - I like to keep a large assortment of bandages in the medicine cabinet.  I like this huge 280 count box because it has some of every size in one place.  Having a separate box for each type of bandage takes a lot of space.  Most of these are the plastic kind, although it does contain some of the fabric kind. We don't use many of the little tiny square ones, but they're nice to have on hand for blisters or small cuts.  The biggest ones are perfect for knee or elbow scrapes.  The fabric ones are perfect for fingers, since the bandage is tougher.Bandaid bandages stay put on the injury, unlike some of the cheaper ones I've bought.  Every medicine cabinet should have one of these boxes, ready for any emergency.
I gave this product one star because I didn't even have the chance to really test it's effectiveness because it started coming off the same day I put it on. I followed all the directions, washed and dried the affected area, etc, etc. My blister was on my hand, while most other people seem to have them on their feet from running.The directions clearly show that it can be applied to your hand (actually their illustration showed the product being applied in the exact same spot I had mine). Well it stayed on for a while until I had to wash my hands and then it just started peeling off.The product says it can get wet and is made to stay on. Don't get me started on the cost of these either. Regardless of which option you chose, your paying at least 80 cents per cushion. That's a rip off. You could purchase 40 band aids for that price, use some neosporin and replace them each day. Much cheaper.Would not recommend.
We never seem to have Bandaids around when we needed them so I ordered these. They arrived quickly and contain lots and lots of Bandaids. They are of the no frills variety, meaning your traditional old-school Bandaid. No flexible fiber bands or anything. There are tons of bandaids in here. All sizes and shapes. Great if you have kids who often get hurt, or if you are accident prone. You'll always have a Bandaid in the house with this pack.Pros: Cheap,Lots and lots of Bandaids, all sizes and shapes.Cons: Very basic band-aids, not very sticky.
These are great band aids but they are not sticky enough, i have tried other Band-Aid brand type of band aids but these can be sticker. I used these for my elbow area and these always came out. They stick better on other parts of your body but anywhere that has movement, these are not going to work well. I did like the assortment though and the number of band aids but definitely not for areas that have movement because from my experience, they come off easily.The other issue i had was that was with ointment, like neosporin, these tend to slide of sometimes. So again with the sticky issue.I tried using these while i worked out at the gym and they came off easily from sweat.Overall they are average band-aids but they are not for areas that move or people that work out due to their lack of stickiness.
My sandals will sometimes rub blisters.  I don't like to wear bandaids or corn cushions, too freaking obvious.  This band aid blister cushions are pretty close to perfect.  They are flesh toned, (if you are beige colored, any darker skinned and they will be obvious.  Makes me wonder, why don't they make these in different skin tones?  Sounds like a great idea to me) and they protect the spots on your feet that are blister prone.  I use a ton of these and buy them often.  Highly, highly recommend.
I was very disappointed that the local grocery store and CVS both stopped carrying this tape at the same time. Are they discontinuing it? It was always more expensive than the other brands (store brand, NextCare), but you got what you paid for. I bought 3 rolls to hopefully last me a while.Unlike competing brands, the Johnson and Johnson cloth tape is:1. Easy to cut2. Easy to write on with sharpie, will not bleed and will not fade3. Very sticky4. Does not leave adhesive residue after being pulled off5. Relatively waterproof
I bought these after having a tooth pulled that would not stop bleeding. I'm by no means an expert on gauze pads so I won't speak to quality etc. I bought the smallest size which was 2x2 inches. If you are having a tooth pulled and want to have some on hand I can recommend these. I did find I had to cut them half in order not cause my 'gag' reflex to come into play. This may have been because of all the stuff the oral surgeon had stuffed into my mouth and my brain may have had it!  Anyhow, these fit nicely into the back of your mouth when cut in half. I'm sure since I have three grandchildren under 7 that the ones I didn't use will come in handy at some point too!
With my washing machine not working, I've been doing a lot of hand laundering, as well as washing dishes. (no dish washer either) My hands with dry Winter air and harsh indoor heating have become crinkled, cracked and rough.I have a box of hand lotiona and creams and last evening applied this one just before going to bed.It helped very much.Upon awakening this morning, I nearly forgot how dry and parched they had been because they feel so nice and soft.I'll be using this every night before bed until my skin heals.Wonderful product for chapped, cracked hands.
A family member had been suffering with lips so severely chapped that they would crack and bleed on a daily basis - the bottom lip looked like it was splitting in two.  This went on for several months.  After reading about this product, I purchased a tube:  within 24 hours, the pain was gone and the skin was starting to heal over.  Within 3 days - after THREE months of no relief and daily bleeding - the lips were completely healed.  To say that we are shocked is an understatement, particularly when we read the ingredients, which appear to be primarily mineral oil and petroleum jelly.  This is a miracle in a tube, and we are not going to use any other chapped lip products.  Highly recommend this.
For the first time ever I ended up with chapped lips this winter. I tried chapsticks, oils (from Vitamin E to Jojoba) and vaseline. Nothing worked. I found a tube of Aquaphor Advanced Therapy Healing ointment in the medicine cupboard that I'd gotten for the skin that cracks on my fingers when winter comes and thought I'd try it on the lips. Worked beautifully. I put it on my lips and within a day the chapped, peeling lips were back to normal. Although it doesn't stop the skin on the pads of my fingers from splitting during the cold dry weather I do find it soothes the cuts that seem to appear! I highly recommend this product.
Folks, the "active ingredient" in this crap is Petrolatum - basically, that's Vaseline Petroleum Jelly.  And this junk contains 41% of it.  Regular Vasoline Petroleum Jelly contains 100%.  At less than 1/3 the price.  So if you want to spent $6.00 on this vs. $1.50 on a Vasoline, please don't let me stop you, but I'm simply telling you basic science.  The "inactive" ingredients include mineral oil and glycerin.This concoction is why pharmaceutical companies are despised around the world.  Take $0.50 worth of Petroleum Jelly, throw in $0.02 cents worth of mineral oil and glycerin, and tout it as "Advanced Therapy".It's B.S. folks - pure and simple.  Junk.Save yourselves some money and do yourselves a favor - but the cheapest Petroleum Jelly you can find; Vaseline or store brand.
I bought this product because I saw that there were 62 5 star reviews and almost no bad ones. A mistake. I should have read the ingredients more carefully before buying. I should have read them at all.As soon as I squeezed some out of the tube I realized it was mostly petroleum jelly. I looked at the ingredients and, sure enough, active ingredient was 41% petrolatum.THAT'S VASELINE!So, if you want greasy hands and nothing else works, maybe this is for you. But I don't, and am somewhat disappointed I didn't read the description more carefully and bought based on all the great reviews. Caveat Emptor.
I discovered Aquaphor when a dear friend went on Accutane. She was in misery because her lips were so dry. Her doctor gave her some Aquaphor samples. I had thought it was only for body skin but I was very wrong. This thick, rich product soothed her lips and the dryness and cracking were gone within a day.I picked up a tube and found it has a many uses. In addition to softening lips (which I use in rotation with another favorite Carmex) Aquaphor can be used on dry knees, elbows and heels. A tiny bit works well as an eye moisturizer and it also softens cuticles.Great product for a little price!
I have dry skin and when the weather gets dry and cold, my skin keeps coming off like a snake (I think it's a common problem that many people have). Before I used Olay Moisturizer + Sun Block and it worked. However, for some reasons, it stopped working for me. My doctor recommend this to me. I tried it and it worked really well. My skin stays moisturized for the whole day. The best thing about this product is I don't have to use it everyday. I apply it on my face in the morning, wash it off by the afternoon, and my skin stays moisturize for the next 3-5 days. The only draw back is the product is waxy. When I apply it on my face, it looks like I just cover it with oil. Yes, shine, oily looking. However, if you don't care too much about your appearance, it is a perfect solution for your dry skin. Oh, did I mention that the price is very reasonable?
Truly the best hydrating cream-eye cream - lip balm that I've ever used!  I'm on Retin-A, and if you know the side effects to using Retin-A then you know what I'm dealing with right now and how you're not suppose to use any harsh products. Retin-A is making me peel and have some redness and irritation from the use but this product soothed my skin when even Cetaphil cream couldnt.  I've used the other $100 jars of worthlessness, and believe me, this stuff will moisturize even the driest of skin.However, some things you do need to consider before buying:This is quite greasy, therefor I wouldnt suggest you use this during the day or with make-up.This lotion tends to get on your bedding's....It didnt seem to absorbed into the skin as well as other top brand lotions or Cetaphil - but it worked better so I'm not complaining.
My dermatologist strongly recommendsAquaphor Healing Ointment, 1.75 Oz (50 G), (Pack Of 6)BIG time and so do I!!  Use it on anything from chapped lips to burns!!  Take the little ones everywhere you go and now there's one for babies!!  Cosmetic Hint: Excellent to use under eyes in lieu of antiaging products now and then and this was also recommended by my dermatologist too!!  Lasts a long time too - look into Amazon's Subscribe & Save Program for this item ->**MIRRACLE STUFF!!**
I have used this for years to combat dry skin on my face. Here is why I like it:1. It goes on clear and works very effectively to moisturize dry skin.2. It penetrates quickly, so I can wipe it off in a couple of minutes in order to avoid having a &#34;shiny&#34; looking face, but still have moisturized skin.3. It is more soothing and less greasy than vaseline.4. Unlike various facial moisturizers, it is fragrance free, so you don't have any smell after using this.5. This tube is a convenient size for travel and also to keep in the office.Bottom line: I have tried countless ointments over the years because I have always had dry skin, and this is the best one that I have found.Shop for price. I buy this for less at my local CVS than the price on Amazon.
I suffer from HS and bought it for this. This is great for itches as well. It numbs the area so you can forget about it, i.e. mosquito bite, etc. I also use it for my edges. After I got my hair braided it was tight and annoying and I am using it for a few days until my hair loosens a bit. I will also use if for my eyebrows when I pluck. Apply first, leave for a few minutes, then wipe. The product should have numbed the area long enough and makes tweezing/waxing less painful. I will buy many times.
After years of having toe nails that grow oddly while at the same time toe nails that would turn almost black , I started using this medication. Even after a just-a few weeks I have noticed a great change and would not be without it. My toes nails re now growing with a distinctive clear color rather than black and they are beginning to take a normal shape instead of the one-fourth inch thick toe nail I used to have. It is still too early to tell if the medication is going to completely clear up the fungi, however it appears it is working quite well.
I used a different product that is Acetone based so it dried & disappeared, leaving just the medicine in place. I like it still but thought a different product might be good so the fungus doesn't get immune to it. As you might know, there is NO cure for nail fungus, not even by prescription, you can only control it.  This product here is an oil, think what it can do to your socks or if any of it gets on carpeting etc. Also my nails started getting a dark cast to the top of the nails where this was applied. This product is no good.
If your going to try it and it has a applicator brush in it too . I bought the pen and it lasted about 6 weeks . Tea tree oil is really the best stuff . I am making some progress using both and planning to try kerasil or the vics vapo rub next if this doesn't clear it up after 6 months . It cleaned my little toes quick but my big toes just won't clear up . They look better but stay yellow - not gross anymore but slight greenish yellow . Getting old is no fun and either is using a dirty shower in a truck stop . Been paying for one slip in doing that for 25 years now but I treat it daily and know I won't do the same to someone else .
This is the only thing I've used that has helped the fungal infection of my big toenail (which I've had for 5 or 6 years). I use it twice a day in conjunction with Fungisoap and within a few weeks I saw improvement. My nail is no longer thick and dark, and while the infection is visibly still present, it looks much better than it did a month or two ago. I cut my nail down as far as I can and keep it filed down so I can apply this liquid under the nail as well. Right now it looks like my nail may fall off (sorry if this is TMI), but I'm hoping like others here that will mean I can continue to use this stuff on the skin under my nail. I'll update this review as time goes by.
My nails and cuticles have been so dry and were looking just awful!  Some peeling of nails, but don't think it was fungus~just cold winter and using bleach to clean while at my daughter's house with no gloves.  Ran across a bottle of this stuff while looking for nail polish, remembered how it had cleared up a toe fungus years ago, and decided to try it on my nails, just to see if it would help.  WOWOWOWOWOW! You wouldn't believe the change in my cuticles and nails in the last 3 days!  Whatever is in this stuff is just really great for dry, peeling nails, with or without fungus, dry cuticles, and who knows what else! I may try it on other skin issues now.  GREAT stuff!
Bought this and Tea Tree Ultimates - Funga Soap for my wife. Both her big toes were gross and cloudy and cracking. Why it doesn't bother her more...I don't know, but I took it upon myself to buy her these two products.She started using them, and within a week or two...both nails fell out. It was super nasty...but I'm guessing both nails were so unhealthy, they probably would have come out regardless.Over the last 6 months, they've been growing back. One of them looks great, but the other is cloudy. Why? Because she doesn't use the stuff I bought her. :)I can't say what the two products do individually...because she only used them together. For the price though, it's worth some of the more expensive options at the doctors office. But you have to be disciplined and actually put the stuff on!
Probably one of the world's best inventions, Vaseline.  But, this tube is just fantastic for babies.  We bought these for our newborn and it's just so much easier to use when you're putting it on the baby's belly button.  Plus, it's best for preventing diaper rash than anything else out there on the market.  When your hands are dry from washing them after EVERYTHING you do with the baby, the Vaseline comes to the rescue. This tube is a marvelous invention and the best sanitary-wise to use for a baby.  I keep one in my purse for my dry hands too.  Love this invention!
I know many use this for their infants but I had dry flaky skin around my nose and upper lip area and I added vaseline one evening and the next morning the dry flakes were history.  I was told by a friend that who has really great skin that she uses the vaseline on her entire face after she splashes a little water on it and it has really made a difference.  I did the same but I did get a little blemish on my chin and I'm usually not prone to acne anymore since I turned 40.  I think I will stick to using it on the very dry areas only.
Every year my Lab (Maggie) gets some kind of contact dermatitis or allergy on her Neck. Not sure from what. This year I purchased the BFI and the Columbia Powder. I do remember as a kid I think my parents used the BFI. At that time it was in a little metal can. Anyway  I use them both and they worked great. Just can't say which one works best. They probably both work the same but I would lean towards the BFI because I remember it as a kid.
This is a brand that I have read over and over that is safe to use during pregnancy.  Stomach problems are a reality of pregnancy so I take this twice a day.  I love the orange taste and found it actually taste better when I don't add more than the water required in the directions; a watery orange taste can be terrible so don't add extra water.The sugar content is an issue but I don't make smoothies so using plain psyillium seed husks is not a realistic option for me.  This is my best choice for something I will actually use on a daily basis.
What can I say? Metemucil works, not only to prevent constipation but also to prevent the runs. Our GI doc actually prescribed it years ago to slow down the works.If you check the labels, Metamucil has more soluble fiber that any other supplement I could find. Cheaper too.Since we use one cannister almost monthly the subscribe & save is great. If you drink it in about 10 oz. water quickly, it does not get mushy. Just don't let it sit for any length of time.It is GF, has no MSG or related products or aspartates.
This product contains way too much sugar for me. I just compared Metamucil (48.2 Oz Container) to Benefiber (18.7 Oz Container), and found the following:With Metamucil you get 114 servings per container.Serving Size: 12g (One rounded Tbsp)Calories Per Serving: 45Total Carb: 12gDietary Fiber: 3gSoluble Fiber: 2gSugars: 9gIron: 0.8mgSodium: 5mgPotassium: 30With Benefiber you get 115 servings per container.Serving Size: 4.6g (Two Tsp)Calories Per Serving: 15Sodium: 0gTotal Carb: 4gDietary Fiber: 3gSoluble Fiber: 3gSugar: 0gMetamucil is tasty but it gets too thick to drink if not consumed immediately. Benefiber is a little more expensive, but at least I'm not paying for sugar and putting on weight from the empty calories.Please rate this review if you found it helpful.
I'm glad that amazon carries this product because I can't find it in my area anymore. I've tried many pre-shave conditioners thru the years but this works best for me. I don't really like buying 12 of these at a time but the price is right and even buying 12 is still cheaper than buying just one of some of the other products I have tried. I will share this with my son and son-in-law who both use this product too. Thanks Amazon for keeping this available to us!
I have been buying this lotion for 6 years from my grocery store. Usually they cost $3-$4 each but now none of my grocery stores carry this anymore. I got this 12 pack for $26 and free shipping and you can't beat that anywhere. This lotion makes it so easy to use my electric shaver without any irritation and it glides with a close shave. Also you need next to very little after shave after using this because it has lotion built in and has a very subtle scent you can use a different after shave lotion or cologne without the 2 scents clashing.
After using all types of eyebrow grooming wax to hold down my unruly brows, I had almost given up until I found this gem of a product.  My current eyebrow wax was a little too hard and unfortunately would yank out a few hairs with it.  In a last ditch attempt, I tried the clubman moustache wax in neutral.  Keep in mind that my eyebrow hairs are VERY unruly (and yes, I am a lady)and finding something that really works and has staying power had been difficult until now.  You only need the smallest amount on each brow because the product is very concentrated.  My eyebrow hairs stay in place all day and look better than they ever have.  I also like the fact that it dries clear and that there is no build up.  It also doesn't dry out my skin like other products.  Definitely a keeper!
I got this a few days ago and each day my handlebar looks better. It's like my mustache is learning to form a curl on both sides. This goes on soft and easy with very little work and then after about 15 to 30 seconds it sets and you have a very firm but still pliable hold. It has a very pleasant fresh scent that reminds me of grapefruit. It washes out very easily my one complaint is that the neutral shows up as white on my red stache and makes me look like i'm greying or have dried boogers unless I am very judicious in my use of the product. So until I find something else this is my go to with a light touch.
This was actually the boyfriend's purchase since he wanted to try black (his hair is naturally black) instead of the clear which is all he can find in stores around here.His opinion was that clear is a lot better even though you have to work it in to make sure it doesn't show up because the black is too messy (i.e. it's black and tends to get on everything.)It'd probably be good if you wanted to darken your moustache/beard though.Aside from that he likes Clubman's and I have to say it makes his beard look much nicer...keeps his beard in control.
The odor was too strong for me. It was a fruity sweet smell but it wasn't working for me.  I had to wash my moustache within five minutes because I couldn't stand it.Also the brown mustache had a strong white layer look to it.  It was looking bad to me visually.It did hold the hairs into place for the brief time I used it.The only useful thing I got out of it was the small brush. Managed to pull one hair out but still nice addition to my comb / brush collection.
My beard always grew in patchy and I tried a ton of things to fill it out. This wax is the best by far.It's good and thick, but you can add water if you'd like to thin it out. It has a tiny brush for pinpoint accuracy. It tends to get on your fingers, then anything you touch, but you can't blame black wax for that. You can only blame mother nature. And if you got a problem with mother nature, you got a problem with me.It can rub off, but a holding spray or spritzer can help it hold. My beard looks naturally fuller and i've gotten a ton of compliments from other beard enthusiasts.
this wax is awesome. its soft and easy to apply it drys on clear and will hold my mustache for a good 10-15 hours without me having the fix it.only complaints are that sometimes it irritates my skin or drys it out, and the container it is in normally ends up getting damaged or a hole in it since its metal and will eventually just get a hole in it from squeezing or folding the tube, ussually happens to me when the tube is 50-75% gone but it will dry out inside the tube fast when it happens. Ive been through about 4 of these in a year and it happened to all of them.
I've been alarmed by the reviews on various sellers' sites saying they had ordered cylindrical and received tapered. I ordered these in August and did receive cylindrical brush tips, as pictured. The wires are pretty weak, and easily bent, but that's unavoidable if it's going to fit into tight spaces. They're supposed to be changed weekly, and I can generally get a week's worth of use out of one, despite having some teeth that are both very close, and slightly crooked, so it's a guessing game inserting the wire at just the correct angle to slide right in.I use a Proxabrush with the conical tip at one end for wide spaces, and the cylindrical one at the other end.
I use these with the Oral B interdental holder that my hygienist gave me. She originally gave me some of the WIDE interdental brushes which worked fine for larger gaps, but the #414 "Tight" works for more of my gaps. There are still a lot of spaces that these will not fit, so I recommend using regular floss as well as a Waterpik in conjunction with these interdental brushes. My normal routine is to floss, use the interdental in most spaces, then use a Waterpik, followed by an Oral B powered brush.Overall: 5/5 stars, as advertised - may not fit in the tightest gaps, but works for 90% of my teeth. I'd probably go with Moderate for a better fit in the larger gaps.
I have used these &#34;pick-like&#34; objects by another brand that contained no metal, and they worked well but did not have any specifically for tight areas.  I tried these.  The sharp metal kept hurting my gums, and were not small enough for the tight areas after all.  In between the teeth where they did fit, it didn't feel like they cleaned as well as the stiff rubber ones by the other brand.  These picks are a good idea, but the others worked much, much better for me.  I would not recommend these.
The "tight" proxabrush refills are just what I wanted and ordered. They get into most of the small between teeth gaps that the larger brushes do not.My only problems with the tight ones is that the wire is so fine they don't last very long (and bend too easily) and there are still some teeth that tight are still too big to get between.I also ordered "wide" only because I couldn't find "extra-wide" on Amazon.For both sizes, the brushes eventually wear out - getting either shorter or come off the wire, but each one lasts at least a week for my use (daily).
I hate flossing but I do it anyway.  I actually should say, I &#34;hated&#34; flossing.  The time it takes annoys me and it seems like my gums still bled everytime anyway.  Now I floss, use this to stimulate my gums and then brush.  This tool is awesome.  My gums like it.  They aren't bleeding now and I get more out with this thing because it goes around the whole tooth not just in between.  I really like it a lot enough to use it every day. I actually look forward to using it.  My teeth feel really clean now.
I purchased this product thru amazon along with another product because of it's ease in purchasing. I have gingivitis for the past ten years and my periodontist surgeon recommended that I use this product on a daily basis. You run the rubber tip (point) between your teeth and gum line. The white residue you see on the rubber tip is exactly what you are trying to remove. The main areas for this plaque for me are front and back of end teeth. Just rinse off with water after each picking and you can clearly see the results. When the rubber tip starts to curl, then it is time for a replacement . I go the the perio for a deep scaling twice a year and my gums are healthy and have been since my first visit over ten years ago. I also use daily a water pick as well, as prescribed also.
We've used these for years but most recently, they've found another use in our household. My son has braces and has been using this to get around the braces to dig gunk out of his gum line and the brace brackets. He uses it in conjunction with hisWaterpik Ultra Water Flosser. At our first check-up with the orthodontist, he was told that his teeth look great and he's doing a great job keeping them clean!It's a great tool for getting around without damaging the braces and I continue to use mine as well.
This is VERY durable; it hasn't broken in the months I've had it. (I forgot to write a review until now...).I had wanted a gum stimulator for quite some time, and I decided to buy this one. it was inexpensive, and it looked legit. Great product for a great price. I am a 100% pleased customer. When this one gets old or worn out (it still hasn't at all though!), I will definitely be purchasing this exact one again. (maybe from a drugstore, to avoid shipping costs. But still this product!)I also bought refills (replacement rubber tips) for when the tip gets worn.Note: For a while I was wondering why the rubber tip felt so hard and stiff... and nothing on the package said that you have to run it under hot water to soften it up before uses.. that, or I just didn't see it. Then again, it is sorta logical... but yeah. Run it under hot water to soften it. :D
With an angled head like a dental probe, the rubber tipped GUM Stimulator is a handy tool for stimulating the gums, and removing plaque from hard to get to areas, like behind the back teeth.  The sharp rubber tip works well in between teeth, and also along the gumline.  While it is recommended that the tip be heated before use to soften the rubber, it probably isn't necessary.  If the tip wears out or breaks, replacement tips are available.Controlling plaque is a lifelong challenge for most of us, and this is a very helpful tool in the battle.  Check your local drugstore for a better deal.
The G-U-M stimulators do exactly what they should do - get the bad stuff out and away from around your teeth.  Even after brushing long and thoroughly, there is still stuff left under the gum rims. The G-U-M Stimulator tip removes the bad stuff without hurting your gums.The difficult part about the G-U-M stimlators is getting the rubber tips onto the metal handle.  It takes a lot of hand strength.  Moistening the tip with hot water helps, but it still takes a lot of hand strength.  The other downside is that a single stimulator is good for only about 3 or 4 uses - then the tip begins to break.  Time to wrestle a new tip onto the handle.
Not much to say here, but I like when products I'm looking at have reviews.These are durable, good, effective... Basically, they are exactly what you want when you are looking for replacement tips for your gum stimulator. Also, they are inexpensive. I will definitely buy these again when I need more!Note: They may seem stiff at first, but you are supposed to run them under hot water to soften them before use. It took me a while to figure that out. I think it's on the package, but I don't remember.Anyways, good product. 5 stars!
These are great travel toothbrushes and I recommend them.  However; at the time I was updating my emergency kit and wanted to add a new compact toothbrush.  Not to take away from this great product - I found a better one right here on Amazon called the Wisp tooth brush.  They are one time use toothbrushes that come with toothpaste attached and weigh nothing.  So, if your traveling overseas or somewhere where ounces don't count these are great and compact enough.If ounces count check out the Wisp toothbrushes you'll be glad you did.  I am now happy I have both and I recommend both for different uses.
I have used Superfloss for years- this new version is a caricature of the original product.What's wrong with it?1- the threader part used to be longer & stiffer, thus making it easy to pass the floss under permanent bridgework, especially those of molars way at the back of the mouth. Now it's short, flimsy, & bends so easily, it doesn't do the job it was designed to accomplish2- the floss portion used to be much thicker, fluffier & stronger. Now it is a mere shadow of itself, and as such is totally useless. And, it shreds!I had read the poor reviews, and always try to keep an open mind. Now I know that the poor reviews are spot-on.  This stuff is worthless. Do not waste your money. Regular floss used in conjunction with individual threaders is a much better solution.
This is IMHO the best floss you can get with or without braces. It takes some practice, and when you get it, you will see how effective this floss is. The fabric works very well at removing an incredible amount of gunk b/w your teeth. It will shred if you get it caught on your braces or if you snag it on something but again it takes practice to avoid doing that. I havent been able to find this stuff in stores around my home, usually, its the only hanger thats empty. Annoying so I have had to buy online.
I had to try this after reading its description.  My denture comfort liner had come off (as my orthodontist said it would) and I couldn't afford an airline trip to have him reline my upper denture.  I was tired of my denture cream liquefying on me, and replacing the cream at least twice a day to keep my dentures comfortable.  Even after I faithfully followed the instructions, I got poor results.  It felt like I had a liquefying gummy worm candy in my dentures after several hours...and, much to my surprise, the stuff came off in a gooey mass.  I even tried letting the cream air out on my dentures--it's an effort, just getting the cream out of the tube--hoping that exposure to air might mean better results, but that didn't work either.
This may be the world's worst product. It is hard to work with, even when following the directions carefully. Once in place, it squishes out of your dentures all over the outside. No matter how much you clean it off, moer of it squishes right back out again. In addition, even after letting it set for thirty minutes or more, when the denture is removed, the cushion grip plastic like substance stays in your mouth; not in the denture. No doubt, this manufacture was trying to make a product to help people but it does not work.
This is a weird sort of &#34;goo&#34; that comes out malleable like fairly hard putty. It can be molded, but it's a little too hard to mold to the gums well enough. I left it in for a few days and it was VERY hard to remove! It seems to have a slightly glue-like consistency. I can see it being perhaps useful in &#34;fine-tuning&#34; a temporary reline kit, but DON'T confuse it with actual denture adhesive. It doesn't stick to the gums AT ALL.
"Cushion Grip" is a paste that is formulated to hold loose dentures in place for a long time - several days in fact (not that it is recommended to keep a denture in for days on end!).  Said another way, the paste has properties that allow it to remain retentive for several days.  I have recommended it to some of my denture patients (if they have a properly made denture, yet still need added retention).If you have to use excessive amounts of paste to keep a denture in, then the denture probably needs to be remade or relined (or perhaps an implant supported denture should be considered in cases of severe bone loss).konedog
First off I would not call this adhesive. It works good to use it at night before bed. I put in warm water till soft, roll it like a worm and sit it in the denture. Close my mouth till comfortable not tight.  It feels warm at first  and I try not to clamp my teeth or move my mouth much. In the morning dentures come right out not stuck at all. If product overflowed above denture I gently trim it. After that I use my regular adhesive and dentures fit great. You take them out wash and put back in with your reg adhesive for four or five days till the Cushion Grip starts coming loose.  Soak dentures in warm water and you can work the old Cushion Grip loose in one piece. I would only recommend for people that have really loose dentures as a temp fix.  It does need to be used with reg adhesive because Cushion Grip is not an true adhesive, just builds up and fills in dentures.
Nice product but after many trials, opted for another adhesive product.  Although CUSHION GRIP is  a good product, it takes second place, in my opinion, to EFFERGRIP.  Why?  Well, CUSHION grip requires placing tube in hot water for about 5 or so minutes and then applying to dentures.  Besides, it costs a lot more than the EFFERGRIP.  For some folks, this could be seen as okay because CUSHION GRIP doesn't need to be applied every day but maybe every 3-5 days while EFFERGRIP requires daily application.All in all, the ease of use of EFFERGRIP makes it the top choice, in my humble opinion.
"Sea Bond" denture pads are a unique product. Instead of being a paste, gel, or powder, the adhesive is impregnated into a pad that rests on the inner surface of the denture. As a dentist, I hestitantly recommend it only for those dentures that do not fit very well and have air space between the denture and the surface of the gum tissue. In this case, the Sea Bond pad fills in in the gap and helps seal the denture. I would rather have my patients get a remake or reline of their dentures if the dentures fit so bad that they need a product like this. However, dentures are not cheap and this product serves as a stop-gap measure until a new denture or reline can be done.Jim "Konedog" Koenig, DDS
After a friend burned some gum tissue on some overheated coffee, a dentist recommended this product, both for its healing properties and overall cleansing ability.  As listed above, this product is recommended (by "dental professionals!")for canker sores, gum irritations, denture & mouth sores, orthodontic irritations, mouth burns, and cheek bites (I'm not sure what the latter is).  I tried a little, and the taste was pleasant and the liquid nonirritating.  There is a mild foaming action as well.  Use ONLY as directed by a dentist or other knowledgeable health professional.
This is the regular Plax (not a knock off product). With the free shipping and no tax, it beat the prices I can get at the local stores even on sales. However, it still isn't very cheap. Maybe if you get lucky with a sale you can beat the price at retail.I use a little measure graduated cylinder (rectangle actually) from a water test kit to measure out about 7ml when I use this stuff. If you swig it out of the bottle you'll find you probably use 10-20 ml per rinse. All you really need is 6 to 7 ml, and at the prices for this, you are wise to make yourself measure it out. You might as well anyway to not waste...
I like always have to take good care of my own teeth.I did a little research like I always do,and found I wanted to try this mouthwash, however it is hard to find this available at any store :(But after searching and doing my homework I found it at: www.drugstore.com/A store I highly recommend,I do all my shopping for items that you would so at that store online.Getting back to the mouthwash, I ordered it because I had heard so many good things about it, things not all mouthwashes do, you see therefore not all are equal.It has a nice taste, I hate the other ones that make you feel like a rocket went off in your mouth and is so strong and zesty!This one is pleasant, and nice.I suggest you try this. I just wish it was more available, I worry they will discontinue it. So you might want stock up on this if you like it. Yes &#34;note to self&#34;
okay i was very skeptical about this at first, but after i tried it, it seemed to help me cure gingivitis! and plus it softens up tartar buildup so you are actually brushing away hard tartar without the dentists need!Amazing ive been using this for about a week now and 1 week ago i had a small tartar formation and today its reduced by a large percentage!i freaking love Plax this will put those cheapskate dentists out of business!Listerine and Crest despise products that actually help the teeth get rid of plaque and tartarall Crest and Listerine can do is just give you a "tartar and plaque fighting solution" but Plax actually removes alot of plaque buildup and dissolves tartarof course it doesnt say it dissolves tartar on the product but you have to use logic, tartar comes from fossilized plaque or plaque builduponce you get rid of plaque you have raw access to tartar if you have raw access to tartar its only a matter of time until its all gone5 stars.oh its a prebrush rinse use it before you brush
I've tried them all.  Natural Ice is one of the best, and MUCH cheaper than many others.  The cherry flavor fades quickly so you're NOT tempted to bite or lick at your lips.  It goes on smoothly which is important when your lips are chapped and dry.  Your lips respond almost immediately.  There is a slight tingling when you put it on, which is the medication going to work.  I bought one dozen in January, and I bought 2 more today. That fact alone says a lot.Caution: Be careful if you get it on your fingers not to rub at your eyes.  It will sting.
This chapstick has been a favorite of mine since I was a kid.  My mom put this brand in my stocking when I was maybe 10 or 12.  I;m 42 now.  It was years since I had seen it anywhere.  Whenever I did, I would buy it up!  I was greatful for the internet and Amazon!  I buy a box full a couple times a year.  Be cautions, my son is a chapstick addict because of this stuff.  He has worn it daily for years.  He says it is a real addiction. lol  This is not your typical sticky, waxy chapstick.  This is smooth and softening. Excellent for dry chapped lips, with overnight releif and healing.  I haven't checked the safety of the ingredients.  I don't think that I want to know....
I have used this product (lip balm)for a long time, and I am extremely satisfied with it, because it has SPF15 and menthol. That is why I ordered this product again.The shipment arrived sooner than expected and the product is undamaged. I was keeping my fingers crossed because the climatic condition for the past few days has been extremely hot. Said and done, the lip balm did not melt.I, highly recommend, NATURAL ICE MENTHOLATED SPF15 Lip Balm for every one for daily use.Thank you, people at NATURAL ICE and thank you, AMAZON.SincerelyKJ Kumar
Bought these after reading multiple excellent reviews.  I work outside and CONSTANTLY have chapped and cracked lips, that peel and bleed.  Chapstick, Carmex, etc...  work for me, but not for long.  Seems like I'm continually applying the balm. So, I hunted and hunted and hunted for the BEST, and came upon Natural Ice.  A few months of using the product, I'm hooked.  The balm seems to stay on my lips longer than other brands, not needing reapplication every few minutes.  My lips are definitely less chapped and painful.
In an urgent need to fix badly cracked/chapped lips I turned to Amazon to find a lip balm.I first tried outBurt's Bees Beeswax Lip Balm Tube, .15-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)only to end up with no improvement after 3 or so days. Although this might not be a fair amount of time I was in agony over my lips and needed a quick fix. I was in need of moisturizing my lips and repairing them, not just protecting them from further damage.I turned to Mentholatum Natural Ice hoping this would be an improvement over Burt's (for me, not that either product is bad) only to find out they were pretty much the same. There was no noticeable difference and my lips weren't improving after another 3 days.I would recommend this product for proactive lip protection, but I would look elsewhere for a moisturizing lip balm when being reactive to cracked/chapped lips.
This is by far the best product...ever...for Urinary Infections.  Better than anything you can have prescribed by a Doctor.  I did a lot of research about Cystex before I even ordered it.This is a very cleaver product...each tablet contains 1/2 of a normal aspirin, which acts against the immediate pain, and another ingredient that creates a chemical reaction in the kidneys and bladder and kills the bacteria and cures the problem.  I am a very allergic person and afraid to take any medication, but this is a dream come true for me.  Don't expect it to work in minutes, but all of a sudden...in a few hours...you will feel pain free.  The bottle says dose is 2 Tablets every eight hours, but I only take one every eight hours for two days and it's just great.  This is a staple for every medicine cabinet.
This product is good and I like it, however the price keeps going up just like many other things once they notice it is selling and get greedy. I am seeking a generic brand of this product so that I can lower my out of pocket expenses. I am a man and do use this product, it really does help when you are exposed to bacteria in your system. I will seek an alternative if price does not lower back to the acceptable range it was at previously or seek another store that sells at the lower price.
I keep these around for emergencies. Recently, I was waiting on the doctor to phone in a prescription for me because it was the second bladder infection in less than a month and I didn't have time for an office visit. Well, she took her sweet time about it. Without these, I probably would have ended up in urgent care over the weekend. With Cystex I almost forgot I had a bladder infection until I forgot to take them one day and I was quickly reminded. I highly recommend keeping a bottle of this in your medicine cabinet, especially if your prone to frequent bladder infections.
I get UTIs when I get overtired/overtextended, around twice a year.  I had been taking AZO but it did not control the pain from the most severe infections (which always happen Saturday at 4 pm when the Doctor is not available until Monday!).  AZO was OK for mild infections.So this time I did some research and people spoke highly of Cystex. Since I didn't have enough time to order it from Amazon I bought it at CVS.  It is significantly (25-30%) cheaper than AZO and works better (at least for me). For the most severe UTIs I would still go to the Doctor and get antibiotics but for moderate and inconveniently timed UTIs, Cystex works beautifully and is a real savior. The pain went away in about 20 minutes and after 2 days of suffering, it was wonderful.
Wish I'd known about this product in my 20s. Now that I'm in my 40s, I find that the hormonal changes are making UTIs something I need to be vigilant about again, after many years without them. I alternate between taking one of these at bedtime, & a daily tsp of D-mannose as a preventive measure. The mannose absorbs & carries away bacteria & the Cystex has a disinfecting action, so a multi-pronged approach. However, for travel these are a good deal less trouble than mannose which is a white powder. I have not had a single UTI in the 6 months I have been using this. I also give one to my elderly collie twice a week as she has developed the same issue. =o)  At least we're in this menopausal adventure together.
THis medication works, because it actually KILLS the bacteria in your bladder because it is converted to Formaldehyde when it reaches the bladder.  It also has salicylate in it (Asprin) to kill the inflammation which causes the symptoms of pain.It really WORKS and used to be a prescription medication.  A relative of mine had a UTI and called her doctor to get an appointment, but surprisingly, the doctors office instructed her to first try Cystex and if no relief in a few hours they would be happy to see her. It really does work.
This product changed my bladder problems from bad to better, but I still have flow problems.The main thing is that a full 6 tablets caused me to have spells of disorientation. I take no drugs, so it wasn't a compatibility issue. I now take 1 in the morning and two at bedtime with no ill effects. The full dose of 2 three times daily caused me problems.I am 68 and a major cancer survivor, but I don't think that affected it.UPDATE: 3/26/2013Working well now. I have chronic bladder problems, but I take 2 tablets in the morning, 1 in the afternoon, and 2 at night. I think I've adjusted to it now. Still have some flow issues, but the bladder discomfort is long gone. I recommend it! Better than Rx drugs.TaosGuy
When your kids go to school they get exposed to just about everything. About once a year our grandson gets the flu and sick to his stomach. He also has allergies that can make him sick to his stomach when he eats certain foods. Emetrol seems to settle down his nausea and help him not feel so ill.It contains no products that a child should be normally afraid of taking and it is doctor recommended. It does seem to help him a lot. It does recommend that you should not drink any fluids immediately before or after taking the product.We have had good success with it and we keep it on hand for those emergencies!
I've been a pack a day smoker for 40 years now and I just gotta kick this stupid habit. Been using these every day for the past six weeks now and have not yet smoked a cigarette in that time. I think that at this point it might just be psychological, but I'm still tempted to head over to 7-11 and buy a pack, so I keep putting on a 21 mg patch every morning and continue to tell myself how disgusting it would be if I start smoking again. Still taking it minute by minute and day by day, but I never could be doing this without the aid of the NicoDerm patches.
Bought cheap CVS brand patches and they never stuck to my skin.  These stayed on the whole day through.It itched a little bit but nothing I coulnt eventually ignore (itching subsided as day wore on).When I removed the patch there was a red blotch there, but other than seeing it was red it didnt hurt nor itch nor have any other symptoms.  Redness went away by the end of the next day (you use a different area of skin for each new patch each day).Dreams were vivid when I left patch on overnight.  Vivid, but not nightmarish in any sense.  I actually enjoyed it.The nicotine was very effective in quelling my urge to smoke, though I didnt quit smoking.  At the peak of my efforts I was down to 6-7 cigarettes per day when I had been smoking close to 40.As a nicotine substitute, it delivers!
I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However, I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit, once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first, and if I find that I'm still having cravings, then I'll bump up to the 21 mg.
I quit smoking twice, so far (hope I won't have to quit a third time but that remains to be seen...).The first time I used NRT, specifically NicoDerm. I followed all the three steps, for as long as it was recommended. It worked, I was able to quit smoking. Staying quit though, that was a whole different matter. I took smoking again after about 3 months, and kept smoking for 6 months when I quit again. This time around I used Allen Carr's method, and it was by far a more efficient method. It's all about mentality and unfortunately, NRT reinforces the wrong kind of mentality.
This is a stable and excellent product. The quality of the blades are very good, subsequently it serviced my needs MORE than the other ones I had. There were no RUSTING whatsoever and the quality of shave was very COMPACT with low irritation. A very good product to buy, those looking for a reasonably priced fitting blades. At Amazon - the price is excellent for this product. Just update - I left quite a few of these on med. cabinet (which is slightly damp) and returned after 3 months back. NO RUSTS.
I guess you can call me a stick in the mud. However since I started using these blades I have no incentive to change. So far, I found the three-blade system the optimal. Two blades work but they feel cheap. More than three blades feel like I am just overdoing it. I actually use the advanced indicator-lubricating strip to indicate when it is time to change blades because I really cannot tell. If it was not for the indicator strip, I probably use the same blade for a year. The package is a convenient size to ensure that you will not run out blades every time you turn around.I use bar soap as my lubricant however; I do not really need one so it is more of a placeholder. One quick rinse and everything is clean and ready to start over with the next day.The Razor's Edge by Somerset Maugham
I was afraid to order  after getting bootleg blades before online . These are the real deal as long as you use Amazon they should take them back no hassle if they weren't  . Amazon also sells  a in shower shaving mirror that helps make the blades last longer too .Deluxe Shave Well Fog Free Shower. It isn't truly fog free none of the are  but it works pretty well so far for me . You need to follow the directions of the company . Toothpaste works great to clean their mirror .  If I have a problem I will post in a review there but it has worked well just like these blades . Together my shaving experience is affordable and painless .
This is the ONLY razor I've ever found that can cut through my husband's beard.  No, I don't live with Grizzy Adams, but he's close! :)  Life without these is just ridiculous - he has to shave 3 times a day with any other razor.  Really, no kidding.  This razor not only does an outstanding job, but it doesn't cut up his face in the process. I cannot say enough good about this razor.  He's been using them for 12 years and won't be without them.  Highly, highly recommend!
This product is an excellent buy and at 1/4th the cost at any store or online sites.  My family loves the product and recommend this product as a great buy.  I even subscribed so the product  is delivered without having to go and order it.  The product just comes when I decide how often.  This is a wonderful program which recommend to all who use products and not have to go and order it over and over!!  A must buy with an awesome program to make it easier to get the best at a good cost :)
I tried the Fusion product and have now gone back to Mach3.  I contacted P&G; over my concerns and must say that you are totally on your own if you have a problem.  P&G; won't even take the time to respond to a person letter or issues related to their products.The Mach3 is a good, simple and straight-forward product that works well.  The price on all blades is so very, very high when you think about the basic components, but one needs them.  So, this is my preference.
I shave my head basically every day, and these bad boys are definitely sharp enough for the task. In fact, I have to be extra careful the first few times I use a blade, because I can easily chop some skin off my skull! Some people say the blades you get online are lower in functionality than those you get in the drug store or whatever -- I have never found this to be the case. The biggest change in functionality, durability, etc is when you go from using the blade that comes with the handle to the blades you buy in a pack. Yes, they put really good blades in with the first handle to get you hooked, then they sell not-as-good blades afterward once they have you hooked. If you don't know this about disposable razor blades, I'm sorry to be the one to inform you.The price was right for me, and the blades work to slide the dead hair from my scalp and face. I'm satisifed.
shaving almost daily for 30+ years now and tried most brands cartridge or disposable.atra was a great blade my worst experience the schick intuition plus.any of the mens mach3 blades a mug, brush and shaving soap is all you will needfor what may be one of life's finest pleasures...Closest shave on this planet, like silk baby!excellent blades, cost and experience for precision quick shavers..no man could ever beat our timing and terrain girlsmake sure you only buy your blades from amazon, don't get ripped upwith bootleg blades around here.blow dry them or place razor in a cup or stand at least(keep them clean/dry)for blade life.no goosebumps or forget about it, turn up the heat please.as for fusion and proglide i love them/but they are costly and mach3 willgive you the fine bare shave you desire for less.
We've been using Mach 3 razors since the 1990s, and I buy this 15-pack here on Amazon because they're cheaper at $1.84/each than buying them at Costco.  Add in free SuperSaver or Prime shipping and they're a great deal!We like that the Mach 3 razor cartridges last for several weeks, even with daily shaving.  They give a smooth, close, nick-free shave without any irritation, and the blades don't rust when left in the shower.We've tried all kinds of blades through the years, and always come back to Mach 3.
This is a decent blade that will give a nice shave for a few days, maybe weeks, with the added advantage of being able to get in tight spots better than later bigger head models of Gillette razors.  The biggest drawback is the price.  Gillette sucks you in with a low cost razor that uses high cost blades.  It's like some printers that are sold at cost or below just to get you into the market for expensive cartridges.  It's gotten so bad that many retailers keep Mach3 and Fusion blades under lock and key to prevent theft.  I've switched back to a double edged razor where you might expect an initial one-time cost of the razor but with very low cost replacement blades, not to mention double edged razors give closer shaves than the Mach3 or Fusion.  And they'll never go out of date.  So these blades get 3 stars for a combination of a decent shave combined with an exorbitant price.
been using mach 3 blades for years, and they work great. I've (unknowingly) bought knockoffs on ebay before, and was able to tell the difference immediately and got a refund. Since then I've been buying them on amazon, because they're cheapest here as long as you buy a decent quantity.I've tried 4-blade and 5-blade razors, and none are any better, so I haven't bothered to permanently switch.also, you can make your blades last longer by storing the blades in mineral/baby oil when not in use. It prevents the oxidation and dulling of the blades
I have owned Mach3 razor for over 3 years now. The razor is good, but hard to differentiate its performance from Sense Excel ( I have owned that one before). Only reason I switched to Mach3 was honestly, I got bored using the same razor. The blades give normal performance, nothing out of the blue like they show on tv. It doesn't causes itching, so that the good part about the blades. However, after a month of use, for a good shave you will need multiple strokes on the same spot. Overall, decent purchase, nothing extraordinary.
I'm an older guy with a very tough beard. When I was just beginning to shave (about 48 years ago) my father proudly gave me a Remington electric razor.  It never did a good enough job and I found myself going for a Gillette blade system.I have used these Gillette Mach 3's ever since they came out. They do the job for me better than anything else I've tried, so I've stuck with them. I buy them on Amazon when the price is right.For those reviewers claiming that they received fake blades, send them back for a refund. Or better yet, contact Gillette and let them know what you received.  Gillette wants to stop the trade in counterfeit blades and will be happy to work with you.
I've used the Mach 3, in its different incarnations, for the past 10 years or so.  But I've always hated buying refill cartridges because of the price.  I even resorted to using disposable Mach 3s for the past few months, but I really hated them.  I was very happy to find these refill cartridges available on Amazon for such a good price, especially with Subscribe and Save.  Now I get them delivered to me at a great price.  Now if I could only find the Mach 3 Turbo or M3Power refill cartridges for the same price...
I've been using the Mach3 for so long I literally can't remember using another blade. To me all blades are expensive but getting these through Amazon has saved me over twice the amount that my local store charges. Good deal plus I didn't have to go in a store to get them. I'm not what one would call hairy so I'm easy on blades. One will last me about a month shaving once a day. I get a clean close shave from the Mach3. If you are new at shaving make sure you do it correctly because if you don't then no blade will be good to your face. There are plenty of tutorials online so look for one. I suggest "Shaving Tips From Gillette".
These razors are definitely solid. I've been using Mach 3 razors for a long time and always get a close shave, quickly and with cuts being very rare and usually the result of my own negligence. That being said these razors are just too expensive! They are even more in the grocery store, but even online they are more than 2 dollars when you buy a dozen! Shortly after I bought this box of razors I discovered Dorco which has a mach 3 like system with razors that costs less than a dollar each and are very sharp. I switched to Dorco after I finished out this box of razors.
IMMEDIATE IMPRESSIONI fell in love with Mach3 razors years and switched over from a single-blade (not straight-edge) razor.  I just wish the price was cheaper!  I saved a few bucks and time by ordering these Mach3 razors directly through Amazon.  Everything went fine with the order.  The package arrived quickly and the product was not opened.  The razors appear to be in their original packaging (plastic is not cut and it is the Gillete stuff).THE CATCHI thought I had gotten past all the online negative reviews of counterfeits.  Nonetheless, I found it quite odd that the plastic cases (holding 4 razors each) were scrapped and had smudges on them once I cut open the plastic packaging.  Those oddities seem to suggest the product is not brand new.CONCLUSIONAll seems fine so far.  We'll see...
Shaving is about as personal thing you can do. It's not an experience you can share. It doesn't make for scintillating conversation. So, PERSONALLY, the Gillette Mach 3 is the best razor for my beard. My beard is pretty tough: to use the belabored joke, my five o'clock shadow makes its appearance around noon. And it's thick. However, the skin underneath is very sensitive. This razor gives me that "close shave" without irritating my face. The price for the cartidges are, yes, a little high. But it's a small price to pay for a product that works. It's sort of like paying a little extra for "bathroom tissues". (But that's another personal thing we do alone that rarely makes for scintillating conversation.)
Sometimes it just makes sense to shell out the additional funds for a superior product. I have a very tough and fast-growing beard that is a challenge to all the different razors (manual and electric) I've tried over the past 45 years.  I have stayed with the Mach 3 ever since it first came out and even convinced my wife that it would be good for shaving her legs. Actually she picked it up once instead of using her usual disposable and from then on I kept finding my razor in the shower.I learned a long time ago when using knives and axes that a good cutting edge needs to be complimented by a proper handle.  Normally the heavier and more durable the handle, the better the cut.  The Mach 3 handle is slightly beefier than most and it makes a difference, resulting in a good angle during application and a smoother shave with no irritation.  Until someone can prove to me that there is a better razor out there, we're sticking with the Mach 3.
I'm buying this set of 6 shaving creams for my husband for the 2nd time....if he didn't like the cream he would have said not to purchase again. At $2.99 per can it is slightly higher than if I were to wait for it to go on sale at CVS or Rite Aid but because of the convenience of home delivery the extra .10 per can is more than worth it for me. I think it smells good and my husband is happy with how it shaves....so there you have it, not exactly a rave review but definitely a "thumbs up".Cheers
$13 might seem like a lot of money for a bottle of cold medication but it's really difficult to put a price on good nights sleep!I was a little put off by the price of Vicks VapoSteam but I didn't realize how long this stuff will last. This bottle, for my Vicks humidifier, will definitely last the entire winter season, so the price isn't so much when you think about it that way.I worried that the smell might be too strong or even irritating but it doesn't overwhelm at all, it's actually quite comforting as it just sort of lofts around my bedroom.I don't use it only when I have a cold but when my head or nasal passages are just stuffed up from daily allergies (my cats!:) or the dry, discomforting winter air that's so irritating to my nose.  About 10 minutes after the humidifier is turned on, my breathing is so much easier and pleasant, I really appreciate this stuff.
I've never understood why Amlactin (and same-formula creams/lotions) have never been very popular for dry skin. People always go for the cosmetic brand lotions, but Amlactin works differently and MUCH better.  The active ingredient in Amlactin is lactic acid, which exfoliates dry, itchy or bumpy skin, and is great for those with keratosis pilaris. After just a few applications, you'll notice soft, supple, silky smooth skin.It smells a touch &#34;chemical-ish&#34; but it's not strong and the scent doesn't last, like some scented lotions. Also, since it's not fragranced, guys can use it too (actually my dad does).It tends to run a bit on the pricy side for lotions, but it's definitely worth it, especially if you have rough, dry, bumpy skin.
I've tried many different lotions & creams to end up with dry, irritated (sensitive) skin. Nothing seemed to work. At first the price of this made me now want to try it, because if it didn't work I was out that money & left with a bottle to pawn off on family.After just one use (after showering) I put this on & my skin didn't feel tight, dry, itchy or irritated. My hands are always cracking & itchy because of washing so much during the day & now I can go a couple washes without adding more lotion.My skin is really soft, not oily or greasy & I will continue to use this lotion for how ever long I can afford the luxury of buying it. I'd recommend to anyone with sensitive, dry or problem skin.
I have used this product for Keratosis Pilaris Rubra (KPR - the type of KP that involves reddish bumps) all over my arms. Unfortunately, it makes the inflammation worse. While it (perhaps) may be good for Keratosis Pilaris Alba (the type of KP that doesn't have redness on/around the bumps), it worsens my type of KP since it inflames the skin. Produced a rash on my arms that put me through itchy, painful, burning hell for a week. It hurt my skin so bad.On a positive note: Good moisturizer though. Just worthless treatment for KP.What a waste of much needed money and hope for a cure for this darned skin ailment! :o(
My dermatologist recommended AmLactin and Carmol 20 Cream to help with severe dry cracked heels. I used both products for several weeks into a couple of months and had *some* improvement but there was still a ways to go before I'd say my feet were going to be "baby soft". I wasn't really pleased with the expense, odor, and clammy feel that I'd experience with this combination and still getting lackluster results, so I did some more searching.I found a really good electric callous remover; it is made by Bario and hopefully you can find one with a google search. I continued to try different creams and lotions and have settled on one that really works and works fast - O'Keefes Creme. This creme is inexpensive, non-greasy, and unscented. I saw excellent results within a week - the elusive "baby soft" feet everyone has been talking about. Finally!Hope everyone finds *something* that works for them.
I've got keratosis pilaris, aka chicken skin. This does a great job of smoothening out the skin on my arms. It takes awhile to start working, as in weeks to months, but you'll definitely feel a difference. I feel less self conscious about my arms when in public wearing a short sleeved shirt.The only thing i didn't like about it was how runny it is. It's very watery, so you should rub it between your hands then distribute it to the body part otherwise it'll just drip everywhere. Also once it's on your skin it feels kind of sticky for awhile, till it absorbs more.Overall i'd recommends this product because it does it's job pretty well. Price is a little higher than i'd like but my arms are smoother so i'm happy to pay that price.
I put this lotion on everything. It is hands down one of the most important beauty products that I couldnt live without. I use this all over and it is the ONLY lotion I have found which 1. doest break me out, 2. actually moisturizes my skin, 3. I can use on my body and my face. I blend drops of hyaluronic acid which I buy from Amazon in with the moisturizer for an added boost. It keeps my skin glowing, smooth and beautiful.I also use this on my boyfriends KP and it is the first time he said he has had any success in getting it to go away.I am impressed with this product more than any other beauty product.
AmLactin moisturizing products come in different strengths to help alleviate rough, dry skin. This "Moisturizing Body Lotion" is for everyday use (recommended use is 2X daily) and works well to keep skin hydrated.For a dry skin cure, begin with AmLactin's "XL Lotion" for feet and hands or "Ultra Hydrating Body Cream" for all over smoothing. Once your desired results are achieved, switch to this one for maintenance.Currently Amazon directly sells only the Moisturizing Body Lotion. It is also the only Amlactin product available through Subscribe and Save. Other AmLactin products are available from third parties, some of whom are Prime eligible.You'll be hard pressed to find the Moisturizing Lotion anywhere for less than Amazon and I cross my fingers that Amazon will again directly sell the other AmLactin products.
My husband brought this home to me and I was excited to use it. I have very dry skin and I am always looking for soothing body butters that moisturize. Well this stuff is not even close, and should not be considered by anyone with very dry skin. It goes on smooth and then disappears, never to be felt again. My skin sucked it right in and was dry again in about 10 minutes. There is a reason why it states on the label to apply twice a day, but it still didn't make a difference. Its an ultra liquified lotion.I'm happy it worked for other people, but like Marissa, it did not work for me. For the record, I bought Nivea Essentially Enriched body cream. I love it! Its greasy at first, but my skin is soft, smooth, and STAYS moisturized all day, AND you only have to apply it once.
I bought this lotion after a friend recommended it.  After my first use, the ammonia smell was too much to bear....it cut clear through my clogged nasal passages (I have a really bad cold).  Perhaps I should have known this ammonia scent would happen since ammonium lactate is the 2nd listed ingredient...but for some reason, I did not review the ingredients list so it didn't even occur to me.  This lotion is so very expensive that I expected something different.  Due to the very prominent ammonia smell, I couldn't in good conscience recommend this to anyone.  Surely there is a more pleasant way to exfoliate and moisturize.
I live in the southwest and had pretty dry skin so my doctor recommended I try this stuff.  After about a week of use, once a day every day, I notice an obvious difference in my skin.  Areas that were dry and peeling aren't anymore and my skin is noticeably softer.  I ordered this size because I like lotions that have a pump, I find I used them more frequently and the bottle isn't as messy, and this one is no exception.  I would certainly recommend this product!
Yes, this stuff stinks. I think one of my pharmacy customers said it best: "It makes me smell like Chicken in a Biskit crackers." BUT, all alpha hydroxy acid products have a distinct, somewhat unpleasant smell. If your alpha hydroxy acid product doesn't stink, it probably doesn't have much (or any) alpha hydroxy acid in it.I guess they could try to cover it up with heavy fragrance, but that's never a good idea for a product used for treating skin conditions. The stink does fade after a few minutes, but if you apply it heavily, it will still be detectable for a few hours.I don't like how thick this is, but that's just a personal preference. Many people will enjoy the texture.Works well for keratosis pilaris, if you use it religiously. Helps dry rough feet a bit, but mostly if you start off with a clean slate (get rid of the corns/calluses first).
I have extremely dry skin and was constantly itching and scratching, sometimes actually causing bleeding. I tried AmLactan Mosturizing Body Lotion and FINALLY got some relief from the constant scratching. It took about four days to completely stop all the scratching. I used the product just once a day, even though the directions say to apply twice daily. Now my skin is soft and silky feeling and the scabs from bleeding have disappeared. The ammonia like smell of older bottles that I have used is no longer present. They seem to have improved the formulation. It's now completely odor free. I just found the 20 ounce size on sale at Costco.com for $15.49 including shipping. I will never stop using this product. It works just as advertized. I would highly recommend this product to anyone with dry skin and itching. Visit the manufacturers website at amlactin.com for more information and you can even sign up for their newsletter. I'm a fan FOREVER!
I got this form my local store because of an article I read. It works great on feet and body. I had a bad callus on my food - I know, disgusting, sorry. BUT I used this every night for about a week before it began to disappear. It makes my feet soft and absolutely amazing. HOWEVER, if you have cracked heels or calluses, they will come back if you do not use this lotion continuously. I guess that's the downside of it. I found this out the hard way when I stopped using it once my feet felt like velvet.Just so you know the generic name for this is Ammonium Lactate Topical. Exactly same stuff, but... cheaper.
My dermatologist recommended I use this lotion for extremely dry skin.  (I don't have any other skin conditions, so please keep that in mind if you are considering using this product for a specific issue other than dry skin.)I've been using it twice a day for about 5 days and am totally impressed with the results.  My skin was VERY dry and VERY itchy, and this lotion has completely eliminated those symptoms.  My skin feels great, and I'm not constantly itching and fidgeting!My only complaint is that the lotion is tacky when applied.  This little feature is annoying, but not bad enough to make my stop using the lotion.  I highly recommend this lotion for super dry skin.
I have a moderate case of KP that seems to be getting worse with age.  I bought this lotion at the store a week ago and after using it for just a few days, my arms look so much better.  I'm hoping if I continue to use it, the KP will go away completely.  So far, it's the only thing that has helped this condition.  I didn't have very high hopes for it but it is worth a shot if you are suffering from KP.
I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning, but then around week 3, it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don't think it did anything for my scar.After talking to a friend, who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months, I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said, it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.I am now trying the Curad scar therapy, and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus, I think a little of the coloring has gone down, but it is hard to tell.
Purchased this to use on a thyroidectomy scar immediately after surgery. I used it for a year before giving up. It did provide some relief to the itchy dry feeling of a healing wound but it did nothing to diminish the scar.I also used this on a scar left from severe acne immediately when it was safe to use. It actually made it worse. My scar became beat red. I discontinued use and began to apply aloe gel to the scar. Within one day the redness was gone and the scar began to diminish.There are positive reviews on this product, maybe it will work better for you. It's very expensive, I would recommend trying an aloe gel first, I purchased a large bottle for $3 at Trader Joe's.
My Physical Therapist recommended this to me to help with tissue mobility above the area where I had a plate and screws put into my fibula where I had surgery for a broken bone.  It seems to have a positive effect however the scar is still quite visible.  It may have helped reduce the visibility of the scar but the effect is not as significant as it would seem from the pictures provided on the box.  That said it did accomplish what my PT wanted but I don't give 5 stars because I don't see it as a &#34;must have&#34; or &#34;must buy&#34; which I consider a 5 star rating to be.
I have yet to see if it will improve overall healing of my scar.  I won't know for several months but my initial experience with this product is mediocre.  Only a tiny amount may be applied without having a flaking mess on my skin after it dries.  The box says that it is must be rubbed in well and even that does not keep the flaking away unless only a tiny amount is used at a time.  It forms a film on the skin.I wish I had ordered the mederma with spf in it because whenever I leave the house I have to apply spf anyway.  Consider that when you buy.  Also, you will not need a lot of this product unless you have a large scar to cover.  Consider the smaller tube.
I have big skin grafts, and I stopped using it after 6 months, then began again a year later.  And I saw almost immediate results when I began again.  Even my boyfriend noticed.  I have also been using it on a  section of tattoo that I just got which scarred on a few lines.  In a few months the raised skin came down and it doesn't bother me anymore.  The stuff definitely works.  Too bad its so expensive in stores.  The gel is tough to get out of tube when it gets 1/2 full.
I can assure you a 100% you will not see any improvement in this from 1 tube! Got to help with unsightly stretch marks and thought this might help with them, but knew this would not cure them. I applied the gel as directed to the affected area as directed for 3 months and saw absolutely no improvement in the skin or color of the scars, and the fact that the tube is so small you will not get enough of the gel to last to see any improvement with out several tubes! So I rate this 1 out of 5 stars considering this is but a common snake oil and should not be advertised to help improve stretch marks! And on a side not I would not recommend this to anyone looking to improve the sight of scars or stretch marks!
I didn't expect much from this cream but it really does work. On a fresh scar it began softening and smoothing the tissue within 2 weeks. I am just starting to try it on a much older scar so I can't really comment on that. Its a bit greasy and probably expensive over the long haul but I am excited by the promise and the results so far.+++++update 2/10:  Update February 2010. I had to have very nasty knee surgery last month resulting in a 10" vertical scar over the cap. I began using Mederma as soon as I got the staples out and it is working very well, softening the look and feel of the scar tissue.
I had a HUGE newly healed scrape that took up half my forearm and it was starting to scar up in a weird bumpy way.  I wasn't sure if this was really going to work because reviews seemed mixed, but it sounded like the newer the scar is, the better it works.  Honestly, I've been using it for a few weeks (I try for once a day, but I occasionally forget) and the results are AMAZING.  It literally looks better every day.  The weird bump &#34;over scarring&#34; areas were gone after TWO days.  Now my scar had JUST healed.  I started applying it a few days after the last of the scabbing had gone, so I suspect that's why I've had such great luck.
I've used Mederma in the past and it worked really well. Well, I've had to purchase it again because of my lovely doggie Isabella. I have so many scratches because of her jumping and playing. I've been using it for a little over a month,and again it's working. This is good stuff. I saw improvement in a week. Of course I would purchase this again,if fact I'll be doing that real soon. I would recommend this to a friend. I think Mederma deserves more than five stars.
I noticed stretch marks on abdomen got lighter and less noticeable. It doesn't take them away. It is very true that stretch marks are permanent because your middle layer of skin has actually torn. This product can be pricey but it is worth the money especially if you don't have many stretch marks. But if you have a lot of large ones You can try a TCA chemical peel. I have noticed that they strengthen the skin by improving collagen and elastin production which in proper amts keeps the skin from tearing.
Thanks to an accident at the river I ended up with a large scar at my wrist. I have scars over most of my body so it didnt bother me. What did bother me is going to hand cashiers money and them looking down at my wrist and looking back up at me with that "oh my he tried to" looks. The mederma has smoothed the surface and reduced the red shade by 2/3 after 4 weeks. I'm going to continue using the product for another 4 weeks and see how much better it gets.
I had a hip replaced and my doctor had recommended this product to help reduce scarring since I scar easily.  I had a fairy long and nasty looking scar so I decided to give this a try.  Here is what I found:1.  The cream is easy to apply and goes a long way!2.  The cream does soften the skin area and makes it itch less.3.  After 3 months my scar has reduced noticeably.  Instead of being raised and hard, it is flat and soft.  There is still a red line, but that is fading in places.While this product is definitely not an instant fix, it does work!  I have several scars that I have acquired through the years that while small, look far worse than this major surgery scar does now!  I am quite happy with the product and would recommend it to anyone who wants to reduce the amount of scar tissue.
I've used Mederma diligently for a couple of months; it was great in making fresh scars barely visible, but not so great with old scars. It is worth a try, but be prepared to be very disciplined - it won't work if it's not applied at least twice a day, for at least 2-6 months.On the other hand, and to be completely honest, I believe petroleum jelly, aloe vera or other similar skin repair products would have the same results if applied 3-4 times a day, for 3-6 months (as directed for Mederma), since the skin regenerates and changes almost completely within this interval. I'm sorry I can't write a raving review and collect dozens of helpful votes, but this is my honest opinion. I don't want to be a kill-joy, I just wish someone had told me the same so I could save some money.
I use this for cracked heels, cuticle oil, pimples, sunburn, & dry chapped hands and lips.  A little goes a long way, and it absorbs nicely (sometimes takes a few minutes to go away).  I'm always amazed how much better my hands are in the morning when I put e-oil on before I go to bed.  Same with my heels.  The higher IU's is too thick for my tastes, this seems to have the best viscosity for whatever I need it for.  I even put it on a Q-Tip and put it in my nose when I'm getting ready to run the tiller or mow because of the dust.  Keeps me from getting such a nasty sinus headach and has a nice lemony smell compared to the menthol that's for colds and flu.  This is awesome stuff.
I never try vitamin E oil before but I am using vitamin C serum which is good to follow  with vitamin E oil especially at night time for better results, this oil is awesome, I just love it!!! is very rich so just a few drops (2 to 3) covers my entire face, the bottle is small enough which makes it very convenient for traveling, some oils have  a rancid smell, this oil smells a bit like lemon grass it's a pleasure to apply it after my vitamin C serum, leaves my skin so smooth and dewy for the next morning. I highly recommend this product.
Niacin is quite effective in reducing bad cholesterol in your blood, especially in my case. I am sensitive to most statin drugs prescribed by doctors.  The usual downside to it's regular use is flushing from dilating the blood vessels while it is being absorbed.  Slo Niacin has an enteric coating that slows the absorbtion, so that the &#34;flush&#34; is not a problem. It is important to watch the date on the product, as the enteric material loses some of it's effect with time. Slo Niacin is also much less costly than statin drugs.
If you have high LDL cholesterol and you have not been able to reduce it with diet and exercise, this Slo-Niacin tablets will do the job. The slow release minimizes flashing that is normally associated with Niacin and the results are incredible. I have been trying to lower my Cholesterol for the last couple of years but with no success. I was stuck in the range of 230-235 and even though I was taking Flash-Free Niacin, my number was not dropping. Two months ago I found out by reading posts on the Internet that Flash-Free Niacin does not work for lowering cholesterol. So, I started looking for another way and found the Slo-Niacin which is regular niacin that is released slowly. This worked great. I took 1500 mg a day for a month and my cholesterol dropped from 233 to 130.  I was shocked by how well it worked.  It makes you wonder why doctors prescribe drugs when a natural supplement like Niacin works so well.
I used Slo-Niacin for several years before switching to Niaspan (Rx required). I take a heavy dose (1500 MG nightly). After the initial couple of weeks the flushing, hot and itchy skin, occurred only about once a week. With Niaspan, the flushing (etc) happened only 2-3 times per month. Now, my drug plan has raised my cost for Niaspan by 250% !!So, I will be returning to Slo-Niacin--but the cost to me will be only $11.92 per month using Amazon's "Subscribe & Save." This is in contrast to the new cost of Niaspan at $50 per month. Therefore, when the itching comes on I will chant a mantra of "But, I am saving $37 a month!"
i was told to take these for borderline anemia because these are supposed to be the best and least-upsetting to the stomach. well, after just taking it for two days, i had a terrible reaction to it, felt nauseated and could hardly eat for a week - i seriously thought i had iron poisoning or something. your body is supposed to be good at regulating iron level, so maybe it was just too much for me since my body was fine with my iron level.this is supposed to be the best iron pill, but it definitely wasn't good for me. i highly recommend that you research and investigate before taking iron pills.
First of all, the product is well tolerated and I am very pleased.  Secondly, to all of you whiners that complained about the packaging: iron is a metal that can, like most metals, kill you if you overdose.  There is no antidote.  An OD can do irreparable harm to your liver.  It is a slow, agonizing death. I do not have children, but I understand the reason for the safety packaging.  Most OTC medicines will not kill you if OD.  This one will.  So, look at the bigger picture here and don't overly focus on only yourself.  There is a simple solution. It is called scissors.  Personally, I don't think they are even needed.  The packets are a little difficult, but if you persevere, you might even find that you develop a little character (a virtue) in the process.  :)
Being constantly anemic, I always dread having to take Iron pills because they leave my stomach so upset.  The Slow Fe tablets are pricey but they are worth it!  No stomach problems associated with iron at all!  My big complaint is that they are extremely hard to open.  It is so time consuming and difficult.  If you have arthritis, opening these will be a nightmare.  I still think the benefits outweigh the cons.  When I am bored, I stand and open 10 or so tablets at a time and put them in a pill box.
OK, so I tried to save some $$ by getting the generic at my local store.  Big mistake.Went back to the doctor and he recommended this brand by name, so I ordered it here because it was cheaper than my drug store.I am on my second box now and it has made a world of difference in how I feel and in my test results.  I always thought generics were just the same as the name brands, but that is not the case for this supplement. I will be buying this brand again
This product (by Nature's Bounty) claims that there are 1 billion ACTIVE Lactobacilli in the pills. The best established test for ACTIVE Lactobacilli is to give them substrate (warm milk) and let them grow over night. Test Result: Two pills smashed to powder and mixed with warm milk (37'C) did NOT produce any growth (fermentation) overnight!. That means that Nature's Bounty is selling us Cellulose + Fructose flavored with strawberry. Should have done this test earlier. Will never buy from Nature's Bounty again. And will start testing one after another other vendors. Hope there will be a product for real?!
For the most part, I like certain kinds of yogurt, but I find that I just can't eat it every day.  I don't like it THAT much.  But I do want to take steps to keep my digestive system on track, and these small, sweet acidophilus chews are a great way to do just that.  I actually take one every day, even if I do eat yogurt.  Plus, the price cannot be beat.  It's always great to be able to consume things that are good for you without totally breaking the bank.
The joke is that this deodorant is not the one we received, even though we wanted this one. Yes, I am aware that I am not rating the correct product, but another Speed Stick (the one that comes in white and smears, and was the last one we wanted) product. Makes anyone upset to order an specific product and receive a totally different product instead. That is why the 1 Star review. For if someone chooses this product and receives one they did not order, I think that would warrant a star. Noticed this has happened more than once, according to other reviewers, and that is Baloney, because what it means is that someone in a warehouse is substituting products at their whim.I know the actual product is great, exactly what we wanted, but since it is deceiving in showing the picture when there are no intentions on delivering that product, I give this one 2 Stars at most.
Wow!! Great price for this pack of six 3.25 sticks of deodorant. Mennen surprised me with this musk deodorant & the quality of it.This deodorant is long lasting & works very well in all situations. This goes on clear & leaves no type of stain on any type of shirt. One stick is long lasting even after applying it several times a day.This is a great way to stock up at an affordable price. I am very,very particular about what I buy & use but could not find anything negative to say about this item.
I've been using Speed Stick deodorant regular for years.  It is effective at killing stink.  It has a nice smell when you apply it.  The smell is not overpowering and it is not noticeable after a few minutes (I have smell sensitivity).  This product does not stain clothes or leave any marks.  I tried Tom's and Trader Joe's natural deodorant but neither of those worked and I could smell my own BO long before the day was over.  While I like to buy products that have no animal testing, I draw the line with BO and use my Speed Stick deodorant.  It's great for men or women and it's inexpensive.
I've used Speed Stick before in the past and had a good experience. So, when buying online I figured I'd stick with a brand that I know will not make me break out. Well, it did not make me break out, however, the odor protection is not what I remember it to be. I really like the smell of the musk Speed Stick. Probably one of my favorite smelling deodorants. Kind of a manly cologne or aftershave scent, not too strong but every now and then you'll get a whiff and it smells great. Unfortunately, the odor protection does not last all day. Probably only last about half the day and by the end of the day I can definitely tell it isn't working anymore. I still give it three stars though for the scent.
I only use this aftershave in the summer because it tends to dry my skin in the brutal Chicago winter. It works great after a nice straight razor shave; smells great and cools my skin. It's alcohol-based, but I'm surprised it doesn't sting as much as I expected. Since the dispensing hole is a bit too big, I cover half of it with my thumb before squirting it into my hand. One day, a female acquaintance hugged me and commented I smelled really good. Two weeks later she asked me out ;)
My husband is very picky about shave gels, primarily because he is most concerned about razor glide and his sensitive skin.  My mistake on this product was not purchasing just one can of this for him to try instead of getting him a six-pack, even though the price was under $3 a can with super saver shipping.  He is not happy with this product.  He's been using this product since April and does not think that it lathers anywhere near as well as other products, namely, Gillette Fusion, which he prefers.  Also, insofar as use on his sensitive skin, the gel is only so-so.  The fragrance is okay with him.  However, what he particularly doesn't like is that the gel does not promote smooth razor glide.  Now we have about four cans left, which he will grudgingly use, unless I can find him a deal on Fusion.  He's encouraging me to find one...soon.
Consumer Reports tested all the toothpastes that promised to whiten teeth.  Some of these brands were very expensive.  If you should review these test results, you would find that there is no positive correlation between price and actual effectiveness.Ultrabrite was the least expensive and did the best overall job of whitening teeth.  Who would of thought?  The trick is finding Ultrabrite.  I usually have to order it in large quantities on the Internet.  My local grocery store and pharmacy don't sell it.  I guess there isn't enough markup in the price!
This Ultra Brite Advanced Whitening toothpaste I purchase in my local store and find it to be a superb toothpaste better than the fancy and more expensive brands.+ This cleans and foams up better in the mouth than the other brands.+ Cleans and WHITENENS better than the expensive kind I have found.+ Works great with a Spinbrush or Oral B Rechargeable toothbrush. Noticed that the Oral B one and this toothpaste work superbly together as my teeth shine and look whiter and cleaner!- For me, since I have somewhat sensitive teeth, so I use this every other day (for whitening abilities) and I use Sesodyne toothpaste on the alternate days. This works for me and keeps my sensitive teeth happy and with no sensitivity at the same time.Highly recommend this!
We use this toothpaste for two reasons; it works and it's inexpensive. We normally keep multiple boxes of this toothpaste around the house and at this point probably have around five or six unopened boxes in reserve.The toothpaste has a pleasant taste and is only moderately foamy which, in my opinion, simplifies the whole tooth brushing process.As another reviewer has pointed out a consumer testing organization has given the toothpaste high marks; that I'll have to admit was the reason I first bought this brand. According to the box the product is made in Mexico and distributed in the USA by Colgate-Palmolive. It contains sodium fluoride .24 % for anticavity protection.We have been pleased with this product for years and see no reason to change.
Now how often do THOSE two words go together? Not that often in a toothpaste! Consumer Reports got me to try Ultra Brite but the results keep my buying it. I've been using it for years and personally I've never noticed any whitening effects *but* it makes my teeth feel clean and maintains a healthy mouth. Rarely any dental issues here in years. My teeth look great and I frequently get compliments on my smile. These days I use a whitening paste half the time but I keep Ultra Brite in the rotation too.UB has a nice minty taste that is not totally over powering - meaning I can actually taste food again within the hour. The paste is a nice consistency and doesn't produce too much foam even with my Oral B electric toothbrush. The price can't be beat - usually a dollar or less locally.Very pleased with this product and highly recommended.
I use a variety of toothpastes (cough...whatever's cheap...cough) and this is what I'd call a "throwback" toothpaste.  It's very simple stuff down to the flavor, no crystals, no magic strips, no flavors from an alternate universe, no voodoo magic, just toothpaste that feels like the stuff they used to hand out on international flights.  It's fairly light, tastes like some sort of generic mint, and cleans very well.  Apparently it's good at whitening.  But the best part is that it's dirt cheap.  It's a dollar for a big tube of toothpaste, basically.  Much better than the other cheap toothpastes (except one of the aquafresh varieties).Only drawback is that it's made in mexico (if that bothers you).  I've never had a problem with the quality control on this toothpaste.
I ordered this a year ago for my grandmother who has arthritis & bruises easily.  Once she tried it, there was no other alternative that worked as good for her (she was using other topical creams & some burned her skin, or left a rash).  This soaks in quickly, doesn't burn or irritate the skin & actually does lighten her bruises within a couple days of using this day & night (she bumps into anything & a bruise starts. Immediately she puts this on & the bruise either doesn't happen or it fades away in a couple days).Now I am ordering again because I use this before & after workouts, when I get bruises and also to ease out the swelling & redness of acne on my face (yes, just 2 times a day on clean skin I rub this in & within a week my large, angry acne marks are gone).This stuff works quickly on pain, doesn't stain, is all natural & we could not be happier in my home using this product.
Of course everyone has a different response to treatments but this has been the go to gel for minor scraps & bruises for the family.It's amazing as upon immediate application its soothes the wound and eases pain,all while healing and lessening the presence of a scar.It's a must for first aide kits and medicine cabinets especially if you have kids.I even used it on minor burns and yes, it works like a charm.Gr8 product!!Also if you have body aches,cramps or muscle pain try arnica tabletsArnica Montana 30x 250 Tabletsnow these little tablets out weigh any other pain relief tablet OTC.
I grabbed this for my natural first aid kit- I use it fairly often now since its great for diminishing the pain and appearance of bruises as well as great for sore backs and hands resulting from yard work or-ahem-a tough camping trip...My son is nearly 2 and gets bruises from regular toddler antics, it is nice to know I can help the bruises go away faster- especially when we know we will be attending an event where photos will be taken...My husband only needs one application for a sore back, I used it on a smashed finger with good results- only needed it a few times to make the throbbing go away and the pain subside.the only side effect/gross part is that this can loosen dead skin-probably has alcohol in it-and the skin or other dirt and grime will pill up and swirl around on the surface when you massage this in. Yuck.but this is effective and naturally based -its just a nice product to have on hand or in your first aid kit.
Hey, I am a born skeptic.  But I think that this product actually works.  And it is easy to apply.  The only down side is a somewhat unpleasant aroma, but away from the nose this does not matter.  My pain is most often in the lower back.  If I apply the gel and then sit in a chair that encourages good posture, the pain is relieved within a quarter hour.  If you have tried cooling compounds, heating compounds, etc., and do not have a solution for pain yet, try this gel, and hopefully it will work for you as it does for me.
Never would I think something so topical could work on my deep down "what the heck did I do to cause this" back pain - but WOW.  I put it on about 2 hours ago and I don't hurt now.  Pretty amazing.  This tube is HUGE for the price, there is no smell, no sticky - it absorbs and goes right to work.  I'm no organic-shmanic gal here... I don't buy into the "natural is better" crowd (few, but we're out here) - still - this product floored me.  It works.  I wish I'd known about it years ago.  And this is the best value anywhere.  I'm using it for muscle pain and stiffness.  You should too.
Have used this Homeopathic gel for decades. As a professionally trained Modern, and Classical Ballet, dancer for over 30 + years, I have sworn by this for preventative as well as helping to speed-up recovery/healing time of sports-type & over-use injuries. Ii is essential to us dancers and athletes alike. Great for contusions, bruises and over-use injuries. Recommend. Only remember to remove all oils and perfumes from skin BEFORE using, and to be diligent enough to use in the morning and evening both. for best results.
I bruise easily, and they last forever (sometimes months).  This will make my bruise disappear within a week.  The one thing I've noticed is that while the bruise will disappear, the area may still be sore like a normal bruise (although the soreness won't last as long as a normal bruise).  Definitely worth the effort and cost!!!  I had gum surgery several years ago, which is where I learned of this.  I applied both the topical gel, and took the small pellets both before and after surgery.  My jaw never bruised (which was a miracle in itself), and had minimal swelling which went away in a couple days.
I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything, but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't, so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall, but I'm doing some topical things to it as well.
I have been lifting for about 3 years now (benching about 95lbs when I started) and about a year ago I hit a wall where I could not seem to increase my max anymore.  So then about 6 months ago I started using muscle milk, glutamine powder, BCAA pills, and this Creatine Fuel.  When Before I started this regimen I was maxing out on the bench at about 185 and just last week I did 245 for the first time and I have increased in pretty much every other area as well.  I have also noticed that my arms look and feel much fuller, they are up to 16 inches now and I hope to continue my journey and maybe someday in the next year hit the 300 mark on bench and make good gains in other areas as well.
i can't say this stuff work wonders,but I can't say that it doesn't help, Consistency is the key to all work outs and lower calorie intake, There those who truly believe in this product So don't take my review to heart, It could work for you better then other people everyone is different and since we all have different metabolism and health system it will work wonders for some and for some it won't, this is a case of try for yourself and see if it works for you.  Since individual result may (will) vary.
Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed, fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits, so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of, I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things.
I have read from a lot of people saying it doesn't leave you groggy but if I take more than half a teaspoon I find it makes me that way.  I don't take melatonin unless I cant sleep at all or if I am not tired but it starts to work pretty fast no matter how much I take.  I guess since its a liquid it affects you quicker since I have used the pill form before.  My 3 year old who is autistic has problems sleeping and staying asleep and as far as getting to sleep she will usually go to sleep in about 10 to 15 minutes.  This was recommended over medication from our doctor which is what we prefer.  She still wakes up some nights but I don't think it has too much to do with the melatonin as it is with her.  Overall I recommend this to help people sleep naturally without resorting to medication.
We have been giving this to my grandson for over a week and find that it helps to calm him down.  We give it to him about an hour before bed and it helps him to go to sleep at night instead of 11:00pm or later.  It has a "sweet" taste so he takes it readily. Now everyone get get some rest.  He has not been diagnosed with ADD or ADHD but is a very active little boy.  I would definitely recommend it.  FYI: we are also giving him Synaptol twice a day which seems to take the "edge" off during the day.  This has relatively no taste at all.
These caplets are fine to swallow and have everything I need in them.  My doctor told me I was low on iron so I've been trying different vitamins with Iron in them.  In these vitamins though is an additive that turns my urine to bright yellow no matter how much water I drink.  I don't care for that.  I went to the doctor to see if I was having a bladder or kidney problem and all is well.  The doctor told me it was the food coloring that they put in them.  Why do that?
I used to get nauseous every day, and couldn't figure out why. I would feel fatigued and get dizzy spells also. I had tried other multi-vitamins before, and couldn't tell any difference so I stopped taking vitamin supplements. Then I started taking this one, and I stopped getting nausous, and I find that I can think more clearly and have a more sustained energy throughout the day compared to days that I don't take it. I have been taking this for a couple of years now and I'm very satisfied.
There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's, and they're probably a whole lot better, too. However, I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine, where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take, I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins, minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick "horse pills." I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin, oblong capsule, and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way, it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin, and this one fulfills that need.
Consumer groups have a lot of info on line about which vitamins are most effectively absorbed.I'll save you the pain of what I went through reviewing the top 100 vitamins out there:Efficacy of vitamins ranges over a wide scale. The best cost perhaps $3 a day to use. The worst do the job 10% or less as well as the best ones. Name brand rarely coincides with effectiveness.These are powder in a capsule, so they absorb rapidly and do their job well. Cost is reasonable, too.What I found after a lot of research, was these occupy a unique niche between the dollars-a-day designer vitamins and the pennies a day junk, offering nearly the performance of the former at nearly the price of the latter.Enjoy! It's great having quality vitamins and not paying exorbitant prices.Recommended - and used - for years. "It's all the vitamin you'll ever need!"To your health!
I've always found it difficult to decipher the pro's and con's of daily vitamin consumption.  The only thing I can offer is over the last month or so I've noticed a slight reduction in energy and focus.  Overall I still feel decently healthy, however, it recently dawned on me that about 3 weeks ago I stopped taking these daily vitamins b/c my supply ran dry.  Now it wouldn't be right to contribute this reduction in energy solely on the demise of my vitamin consumption but it would be safe to say it's very possible these vitamins may have been benefiting me all along.  I'm placing another order regardless :)
I started using this in combination with Raspberry Ketones and found it made me stronger in my workouts. I have also been able to keep weight off with it. But remember, nothing is a miracle pill. I use it in combination with regular workouts and watch what I eat. I keep track of calories and always expend more calories than I use. If you are not wanting to loose weight then taking this along with the Keytones about 30 minutes prior to workout should help you to be able to move more weight.
I've been taking CLA for about 5 weeks.  I'm quite obese and I've noticed that my belly fat is shrinking more than usual when I'm restricting calories. I am eating about 1800 calories a day for the last four months and losing about 3-4 lbs a month.  That is fine since I've lost hundreds of lbs. over the years and always gained it back.  What I'm hoping is that I won't gain it back this time; that I can just continue eating the same, 1800, and my body, which fights me to gain, will be happy with the lower weight.  One weird thing that I have noticed is that when I take Tylenol, it's doesn't work anymore.  I take it 2-3 times a week for arthritis.  I can't take NSAIDS so that is unfortunate.
I purchased this product because I have decided to be in TOTAL GREAT HEALTH, I did not want to start off with anything that would give me the shakes or have me feeling weird or bad, I wanted something natural to help with my stomach fat, I can say that I have changed my diet, smoothie in the mornings, water all day, and a full course meal with protein and vegetables, no bread and no sugar, walking every day for 30-45 minutes, I have have seen a tremendous result. I feel much better and I am determined to obtain total health.
I enjoy that one soft gel is a serving. For me this was a good value, especially with being 1200mg per serving as opposed to something were you have to swallow 2 or 3 pills for the same serving.This is a very effective form of CLA with Tonalin and for the price it isn't bad. However, if foul smells bother you, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. The bottle I received left such a strong odor in the room long after I took my pill and closed the jar, that I cannot take it out of the house.It's effectiveness and ease to take is great, it just really needs to stop smelling so foul.PROS:Simple to takeEasy on stomachEasy to swallowEffectiveCONS:Bad flavorBad Smell
Pros:-Small-Great stats (high in protein and calories relative in size)-The Chocolate and Mocha Chip tastes Great-No chalky tasteCons:-Fiance thinks they taste awefulBefore I bought this product I always thought Balance bars were low in protein and just a womans meal supplement.  Well, now they are my main protein bars and eat them all the time between meals when I am hungry.I would give these a 5 star, best nutritional/protein bars I have ever tried.  No chalky taste, very smooth texture (overly smooth compared to others) however, the fiance hated them.  Not sure why, but she could not even eat them, however, she loves the Cliff bar brand.
I love the original Mocha Chip balance bars.  They were terrific.  But, they put them in new packaging (fine, who cares, right?) but they also re-formulated them and it's really sad what they've done to them.  They're sickly sweet now, they have a cake-y consistency that's not appealing and there's barely a "chip" in sight.It's all bad.  I bought tons of these and ate them for breakfast.  No more.  The new ones are so bad, I threw out the ones I bought after trying a few times to eat them.
I'm always the type that needs to snack on items through the day to avoid headaches and feeling fatigue.  I'm very physically active and don't have time to spend for large meals so need something filling, easy to take with me, and is delicious.  The chocolate craze is essentially like a desweetened chocolate bar for me.  I just can't tire of the taste, it's the best I've ever had with these nutritional bars.  I only wish they were cheaper as it's quite pricey.  But as the saying, you do get what you pay for.
Compared to other High Protein Balance Bars and other brands of protein bars, this flavor is very good. The coffee undertones complement the standard chocolate flavor well. There is no doubt about it as you're eating: This is a protein bar, chalky flavor and all. But the coffee + chocolate does a better job than most flavors at hiding it well. If you haven't tried it, and you have a reason to be eating high protein bars try it.Look at the nutritional information, these bars do have a lot of protein (15g), but are really not all that healthy. 6 grams of fat (4 g Saturated Fat) per bar. 21 grams of carbohydrates (18 g sugar) will make this bar a non-Atkins friendly bar. Perhaps all that fat and sugar are what makes the bar taste relatively so good.
Over the years, I've sampled probably 50 varieties of energy bars, and the Balance cookie dough flavor top the list. The provide the variety of nutrition I want in terms of the combination of protient, fiber, fats, and vitamins. Best of all they don't have lingering artificial taste I get from most other energy bars. Moreover, these don't require gnawing to chew and swallow. The only aspect I would improve upon would be the sugar content, which though not bad by energy bar standards, could probably be a few grams lower without sacrificing taste.
I've tried A LOT of different bars over the years.  Many serve a specific function like "high protein" for after resistance training or "150 calories or less" for a light snack.  In the general, "meal replacement" category, I always seem to come back to Balance Bars, and Peanut Butter in particular.  It's not overly sweet like many of bars that try to be more like candy bars and at 200 calories, it satisfies perfectly.  I am a Peanut Butter fan and this bar tastes really good.  You're not going to think you are eating a spoonful of PB, but the taste, consistency and chewiness all make you feel like you've eaten something.  Sometimes bars just disappear and you wonder if you ever ate anything at all!  As the name says - this is a nice nutritionally BALANCED bar that will fill in as a nice snack.
I can tell the difference immediately when I take this supplement.  I have replaced my multivitamin with this only, since I am concerned about taking too much of the vitamins A and C.  I have been reading that too much of those two vitamins can cause serious problems, worse that a defiency.This is my old standby and it has exactly the right amounts of each of the B vitamins, without overdoing any of them, which can cause, in the case of vitamin B6, serious nerve damage.  This has only 50mg of B6 which is just about right.  Any more and you are taking too much of a risk.This always acts like a tonic for me.  If I go without it for a few days I slow down and don't feel right.  Twinlab is one of my favorite supplements, and this one in particular is a mainstay of my supplement regimen.
I bought mine a few months ago but only took them like 10 times or so. I only tried these because of the Rave reviews on here & I must say Im disappointed. Not only are they WAY TOO BIG, and have to take 2 which makes it a choir to take, a forgetful one at that; but they dont really do much at all for me. It generally doesnt make me feel noticeably calm, relaxed, energized or anything. I expected so much better. Ill stick to my oneaday.
You clearly see Stess B-Complex Caps. Well look carefully on bottle on right hand bottom it has Vit C in it. I cannot take the acid of Vit C, thus had also ordered Ester C, non acidic. Greatly disappointed when it arrived to find the line under what you can see with any ease is saying VIT C also. I do well admit it was on confirmation of order but had to go back and read for first time. I look at what is on screen to order and seldom look at confirmation as most who order a lot on Amazon. Amazon, LOVE IT!!
While most people will benefit from a daily B-complex supplement, it should be a high quality capsule (tablets are produced under heat and pressure, which destroy some B vitamins).Most B vitamins are water-soluble, so the body can easily get rid of any overdoses. However, the B12 is useless in all these B-complex supplements because B12 has to be spray, sublingual or patch. I use the Vie patch for this.Be careful with folic acid though - it can cause cancer as it's synthetic - you really need folate, the natural version of vitamin B9. Anyone who finds a B50 or B100 complex with folate, not folic acid, please add a comment!
For many vitamins, you can list off several benefits that you'll receive from supplementing with them. But with B-Complex vitamins, the benefits gained outweigh the price you'll pay, especially if you're getting on here.  Some of the health benefits are the boosting of your immune system, increases in your metabolism, increases in cell growth, and in my case, the the optimization of neural functions. I take nootropics and this vitamin has been repeatedly indicated as being the vitamin with the highest cost per benefit ratio when it comes to keeping the neurons in your noggin in top shape. Highly recommended. Good luck with your noggin functions.
I have neuropathy problems and must take additional B Vitamins to keep it under control.  I had been taking tablets, but found that they often got caught in my throat and I would end up not taking that dose, and as a result I would have the pain and tingling in my legs that trouble me so much.  But gagging down a large tablet didn't seem the answer either.  These capsules are easy to swallow and I have noticed a marked improvement in my neuropathy problems, and an over all feeling of calmness.  I would certainly recommend this product to anyone who should take more B Vitamins.
For years I have taken a b-complex vitamin, but was interested in these because of the added ingredients to combat stress.  I haven't had any problems with the quality of the product as other reviewers have reported.  When I received the bottle it was smashed in the package, but I contacted Amazon and they replaced it immediately.  I had a new bottle the very next day.  I'm kind of on the fence as to whether or not the product is helping.  I can't say that they are much different from the b-complex vitamins I used to take.
I have been taking B-complex vitamins for years but recently changed to these Twinlab vitamins. I definitely like the formulation of these better than any others I have taken, particularly because these include choline and inositol, both of which are helpful in stress/anxiety relief. The directions suggest taking two capsules a day. I tried this but unfortunately I just felt too jittery and uneasy after taking such a potent dose. Thankfully one capsule a day works great for me. They're great to get me through that 2:30 slump at work and help me sleep better as well.
My anxiety had gone through the roof and I decided to check these out since I did not respond well to 5htp (tip: supplements that mess with your serotonin are not the best for certain types of depression). These are wonderful and contain inositol, a supplement that has been proven to help with severe anxiety. These are also capsules instead of tablets, which are always more expensive but I find are more effective. If you suffer from anxiety or depression, it is worth it to add these to your routine. I feel much better and calmer.
this is a good product, I like twinlab brand.  But be aware that all B complexes are &#34;stress&#34; relievers, and to label this as a stress b complex is just a way to entice you.  All B complexes relieve stress by giving your body the necessary nutrients to regulate proper blood flow, and the niacin which flushes toxins from your blood.Also, this complex adds vitamin C to the mix to increase immune support and helps to absorb the B vitamins, especially riboflavin and niacin.  You can actually get this same product cheaper by buying a B complex and then getting a bottle of vitamin C.  So this is a good product but the proportions and vitamins can be purchased separately for cheaper.
I found this list, which shows the percentages for each vitamin in this product, on a different site and thought I would share it here. Sorry it doesn't paste in table format. :PI only wish they would specify whether or not the B12 in this is the cyanocobalamin or the methylcobalamin version.

I chew these E's -- I could swallow them but I like the taste and the feel of these little perles rolling around in my mouth before and after I bite into them.I've been a Twinlab Customer for over 20 years-- they are consistently good, and when I first started using their products, I was drawn to them because of their quality and reputation.These E's are NOT Dl-Alpha ("fake" Vitamin E) tocopherols -- they are the Real Thing, made with pure, quality-controlled products.
I'm following the Vaso Guard therapy from "What your doctor won't tell you About Hypertension". The author has a list of vitamins,etc to take and lists specific forms of the vitamins.The author (also a doctor) was very specific in the E coming from several types. This was the only brand I could find that actually included the information!!!It's very frustrating that many brands don't include that info in either a picture of the back of the bottle, so you can see that, or at least in the description field.I'm glad this one did!
I never used to pluck my eyebrows but since I've been trying the &#34;do what the other girls do to look professional&#34; thing last semester, I've decided that it's probably something I should do.  I got a facial in October and the beautician gave me a free eyebrow wax.  I had someone else do one when the unibrow came back and decided that I could just pluck my own 'brows.This is not the most accurate thing but if they literally had something that could only pick up one hair at a time all of you would go insane.  It gets more than one at a time so you just have to plan a little better.  They're really very accurate when you're paying attention and they do hold on to the hairs.  If a beginner like me can figure it out, you seasoned pros should be able to, too.
I I love these things they are great to use and I don't know anything about grabbing the same strand 10 times because my strands come out on the first try every time. The tweezers feel great in my hands and I love them and I have styled my brows and am loving everything about my new sleek style. Let me not get a big head but these tweezers are awesome so believe me they really work if you want a little more grip then get the ones with the diamond dust their more grip worthy but the diamond dust does wear off but worth it while you have it in the mean time i'm loving these ones SO MUCH. Enjoy if you purchase them if not then enjoy which ever ones you did find contentment in. lol
I got this to put into my first aid kit.  I wanted a decent tweezer to ensure I could pull out a splinter or what not.  The worst feeling is when you go to clamp onto a hair or splinter and it cannot grip it correctly to tug and pull, then we got issues....To me, if a tweezer cannot grip a single hair, then it's no good.  Well this tweezer is good enough as it passed the single hair pull on multiple occasions.  I would spend the extra dollar and change to get a decent tweezer than be left with a useless piece of metal that looks like a tweezer.Cheers!!!
This used to be my favorite tweezer until I found Revlon Platinum Tweezer, Slant Tip.  Now it is just ordinary.  The tip is great and it holds well and all, but the Platinum has such a finer tip and I have uploaded just how micro fine it is in my images here:http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/customer-gallery/AXQNEMI9N0Z2D/ref=cm_aya_bb_listsWhile I haven't uploaded a picture of the Revlon Expert Tweezer here, it is similar to the Tweezerman tip in width.  The Platinum really is much finer and easier to use.I hope this helps.
I bought two, one for me and one to send to my husband who is deployed. They came in this blue flower design, my husband said they are embarassing to use, I like them better than the black. He made me buy a new pair in a normal color. The product works great though, I rate it up there with tweezerman which are much more expensive, they don't have the edge that tweezerman does but thats helpful for me because i don't accidently pinch my skin or break off hairs instead of plucking them. So I love mine, him not so much.
I think I paid something like twenty-three dollars for these blades the last time I got them at Walmart. They seemed to be a hot item as they kept them locked up or behind a counter for a while. The sting from the price was worse than any cut I've ever gotten from them. The blades offered here are currently about $6.00 cheaper. The exact same packaging but made in Germany (which seemed to be a plus in my mind) to be sold in Oceania. Came quickly (within a week.) No complaints.
I purchased these blades from MG Electronics via Amazon.  These blades are horribly dull compared to the same brand of blades you may purchase from a reputable retailer.  I was unable to get even one shave from the blades (I have attempted with two). I will attempt to return these to Amazon.  Do not buy these blades.Update: I have had a prompt call from the seller and they have informed me that they received a bad batch of blades and have happily agreed to accept the return and cover my shipping costs.  I'm pleased with the resolution from the seller and their prompt attention.
I use these for assisting in a low carb diet. I test for Ketosis daily and they definitely help keep me on track better than without-- it takes the guessing out it. Foolproof to use, results are instant and the colors are bright and easy to read. There are cheaper varieties out there which I have also tried but these are the fastest and they seem to be more accurate and reliable. Cheaper brands have given me results all over the place. If you use 1 or 2 a day a box will last you a long time.
I am an avid low carber.  If you buy any of the other brands they DO NOT compare to this one.  I was buying the cheaper reagent sticks in Walmart for half the price.  Here is the issue, they don't always turn color.  These however will not fail you and there is no guessing game as to the color.  I had bought both bottles and compared them as I was rather suspicious of the results from the cheaper brand, the cheaper one barely showed a color and/or none at all and the Bayer brand was a moderate to deep purple, where I thought it should be.  Make sure when your ordering that if your in somewhat of a rush not to order the one from the UK, you will wait forever!  Also, don't buy too many, they don't have a long expiration date.
As mentioned with the test strips [please see that review] these fit the Accu-Chek, meter with the built in lancing device.  They provide a convenient way to double check my blood sugar, against the One Touch unit I have (through prescription) and their lancets and strips [which are different of course].  Again, they take a little getting used to and making sure they are &#34;seated&#34; properly in the device is one reason I didn't give them five stars.  It's pretty much the same though with most of these.  Otherwise, they're fine.
I've spent years cringing even at the though of using lancets to draw blood for my glucose meter.  Sometimes in the past I was so fearful of the pain (small that it has been really) that I avoided testing as frequently as I knew I should--and then being so mad at myself for my cowardice!  Then I switched to an Accu-Chek meter and started using these lancets.  At first I did my normal cowardly cringing but was absolutely astounded by the minimal pain of the pricks.  I am sold.  I draw blood reliably with an intermediate puncture setting. The device is easy to use.  I know that I will manage my diabetes much better now that I am not so intimidated by finger pricking.
The only reason this product gets as many as 3 stars is because my mother-in-law who swears by them and cannot live her day or night without them.  HOWEVER!  Over the past month, the price has doubled and then some going from approximately $11 to $20 them to $24 or more per package.  Plus shipping in from some distributors.  I am pretty outraged by this.  The local pharmacy the caters to the elderly (and is overpriced on everything) sells the same pack for $17 (something I would never have considered before now) and Giant Supermarket sells for roughly $15 per pack.  What used to seem over priced now feels like a steal.  I've told Mom to start thinking about other brands since these are pricing themselves out of the market.  At 5+ packages a month, she is spending$125 or more on a necessity that used to cost under $50 per month.  Outrage(ous)!
These pads, which, as I age, I'm finding useful are indeed very discreet and also eliminate odors.  I have COPD, which means a lot of coughing and sneezing, and the consequences of age (80!) plus these - well, anyone interested will know what I mean!They come in different lengths and thicknesses, so there's a lot of choices to allow you to decide just which ones you'll need.  This brand was my first choice, and I've been very satisfied, so haven't tried other brands. I do recommend these.
Fist let me say that I have used Tena for a long time. I have usually been very satisfied with it.The last two purchases were not that great. In the first one, 2 of the pads were not usable as they split as soon as you took the tape off.On the next package, there were 6 of the same thing. I am hoping that this is not a regular thing as these pads are expensive and should be intact.Hopefully this will be fixed soon and I can upgrade this review because I really like this product.
After prostate surgery a man needs to know which pee pad to use. I went through a process of trying a few kinds, and am now settled on this one. I wear knit boxer shorts and attach the top end of a pad to the stretch band of the shorts and tuck the rest of the pad down to the crotch of the shorts. Not exactly the best feeling in the world, but beats having a wet spot on the shorts. The pad stays put, and if there's ever a big leak I just replace the pad. What's to say: prostate surgery is a bitch.
Of all the pads on the market that I've tried, and I have tried a number of them, I like these the best.  I used to wear Poise pads and one day on a whim I read the reviews of the Tena serenity products.  That review read like it was my own story so, it made sense for me to try the product.  I have never looked back since then.  In my opinion, these pads hold more liquid and are more comfortable than any of the similar products on the market.  I didn't give them five stars just because I don't feel any of the pads on the market are perfect..  But, I do recommend them!
I tried a new product I bought from Quality Home Care called Tranquility Overnight Pads. So far this web site is the only place I can find them and you will need to call Customer Service to order because they are not on the web site yet. Tena Serenity is almost as good but the shape is a little different. The Tranquility Overnight was just put back on the market in Jan. 2011. It has a full hourglass shape so is as wide in the front as in the back. The Tena Senenity is more narrow on one end than the other. I prefer to buy by the case so will order the Tranquility again but will also buy the Tena Serenity when I can find them on sale. Of the two products the new Tranquility is the best.
I have been purchasing this product and it is perfect for my needs.  But all of a sudden the price was jacked up from $18 to $46+.  I am a senior lady on a fixed income and cannot afford to pay $1.50 per pad - this is ridiculous.  I told Amazon to cancel, got a confirmation of the cancellation, then the next day got a confirmation that the order was shipped.  So, I have to refuse it when it comes as I won't pay that much for the product.  Back to checking the local brick and mortar stores.  Too bad as I liked the subscription delivery, but don't want to be gouged.
Bought these for a family member, and she finds them not too bulky and very comfortable to use; she has just a little stress incontinence, she "dribbles" a little bit on her way to the toilet, and even though it's only a few drops, it can be very embarrassing and upsetting.  The tena pads are capable of holding much more, and the surface stays completely dry, so each pad can be re-used all day long with no odor or wetness resulting.  She changes them twice a day, which saves on cost.  Also we have auto delivery which is also much less expensive than the local supermarket, you don't have to be seen buying them, and there's always a good supply on hand. Even without using available coupons, it's cheaper this way, although I wish I could use the coupons here. This product, and getting them through Amazon, has been a true dignity-saver!!
First, they change the product.  The packaging AND the pad.Grandma's comments..."What did they do?  They made it thinner and shorter!! It does not hold my pee anymore!Why do they always change something that works and make it not work? These really stink now.I don't want you to spend the little money I have left on this crap. Please find me something new that works!"This was when they were $10.99 for 30 overnight pads.  Now they are $28.00!!!!!Are they crazy??? Do these people know the limited finances seniors are on??
I have used other pads and thought they were fine.  This pad is GREAT in all situations--a little leakage to an all out situation where I simply cannot make it.  Saved me embarassment in a busy store or a car trip.  I had a mild allergy to the blue strip used in some other pads.  I am always comfortable and confident with this pad. It is very, very absorbent. Try it--you will love it !!!  I use "SUBSCRIBE AND SAVE" to receive them monthly at reduced price and NO SHIPPING CHARGE.  I can add an extra pack or skip a month as needed with this service.  Thanks Amazon
What obviously should have been listed as a three-pack of 36 pads each for $49.50 is a priced (AND SHIPPED) single pack of 36 pads.  If this is, as Amazon claims, a change in supplier that has resulted in this HUGE increase, then Amazon NEEDS TO FIND ANOTHER SUPPLIER.  Telling their customers that this is a legitimate product price increase just shows that Amazon.com is not paying attention to their customers AND their products.  I hope someone at Amazon.com is looking at these recent reviews, since they don't seem to be taking their e-mails seriously about this ludicrous price increase! For people who need this product for medical problems, many of whom are on fixed incomes, these pads can still be found elsewhere for between $17 and $19 for a package of 36 pads.
Between November's shipment and December's, Amazon tripled the price of this item with no warning. I got a shipping notice for TWO orders when I only have a subscription for 1 a month. THEN THERE WAS THE PRICE! These pads went from around $17 to $45! Now I don't know about you, but I can't afford an unwarranted price increase like this.From now on, I'll be going to the drug store and paying the regular price even if I have to stop by three of them to find this size.
It works, however unless you need to watch your cycles on a long term basis (infertility, PCOS, etc) I found a website that sells very cheap ovulation test strips. Google early-pregnancy-tests. For a 'normal' person this site is what I recommend over these strips, due to cost. With that said, this machine does work (remember you must by the $150-200 monitor to use these strips) though it is pricey when the above mentioned site has test strips for a fraction of the price. Again, for long term issues (infertility, multi preg, etc), this machine is a good investment.
These are the test strips for use with the Clearblue Easy Fertility Monitor. The 30 pack is great if you are returning to fertility postpartum and need to test every day. Amazon has the best price I have found for the test strips, especially if you will be needing them every month and join the subscribe & save program.My husband and I use the Marquette Method of natural family planning and these test strips work perfectly for that. Although these strips, when used with the monitor, will test for LH surge, these are NOT ovulation predictor strips. These are for use with the Clearblue Easy Fertility Monitor only.
I love the clearblue monitor.  It has been consistently reliable for me and I used it successfully to conceive my son.  Once I bought these test sticks off Amazon, however, the monitor isn't working properly anymore.  I'm backing up my ovulation tracking with OPKs I bought at the drug store and despite the fact that they are showing an LH surge, the monitor isn't.  This has never happened to me before.  The ovulation tests from the drug store always coincide with the monitor.  My cycle is so reliable and the monitor has been so reliable in the past that I suspect something is wrong with these sticks I bought off Amazon.  I will not be using them next month.  I will be buying a new box from another vendor.
I have experienced neck bumps from shaving and ingrown hairs for 15 + years. They are now a thing of the past because of this item. My dermatologist could not help me with the several different prescription medication. --- My suggestions / buy one, test as instructed (small area of skin for 24 hours), if no allergic reaction start using 2 times per day - Once after shaving in AM and apply at night after washing face for bed. I noticed the improvement within 3 days... yes 3 days!!!!!!  Final tip - if this works for you, look for the 3 or 6 pack to save $ as they are small and you will use one can within 30 days.
I can't begin to tell you how good this stuff works. I was browsing Amazon and came across this product. It's the same one I purchased at the drug store. I've been using this stuff for about 4 years now, and it doesn't even take a day to see the results. When using it regularly, you won't even see any bumps. I used it on my face for a while and haven't had any bumps since. I stopped for a while using it on the back of my neck, and although the bumps weren't as bad as they were in the past, I went back to using it. Same results. Bumps go down and in a few days, away.The dermatologist gave me a cream some 11 years ago and it worked so well. But this stuff works even better. Great product.
yes it is true, this thing works over night, I put it on as soon as I got it and while I was not that sure it will work, to my amaze, this thing sure did work, I get these bumps on the back of my head, I guess must be a bacteria from sweating a lot, because I do not shave, so this cream specify is for shaving bumps, but hey what do you know? this treatment did work on me, just after 3 days my head is clear.. the only bad thing about it, the size, too small, but well worth!!!
I purchased the high time bump stopper for the red, painful, ugly razor bumps on my neck. For the first couple weeks the product seemed to work. But after extended use my body seemed to become immune to it and it no longer worked. It is easy to apply and goes on smoothly.  Although this is not the best product I think for razor bumps.  After years of research and trial and error I discovered Tend Skin.  Tend skin works the best on my razor bumps.  With habitual use my razor bumps have almost gone away. Occasionaly I will get a couple smaller bumps but never the large painful ones.  Try tend skin and see if it works for you.  I purchased it also using amazon.
I didn't realize at first that you don't set the time window with any clock inside the machine yourself. It does this itself when you set it for the first time. So make sure to set it at the most convenient time as possible for you. If you set it to start on the first day at 9am, you have from 6am to 12pm to test. It asks for your first sample on day 6 so make sure and buy the test sticks too. Its that simple. Anytime before that window or after it, and the machine will not ask for a sample.My ovulation is irregular and comes late so I start my first day about five days after the last day of my period. It will all work out the same.
I bought this to help me conceive more quickly. The first month I used it I got pregnant. After having that baby I used it a couple of times more to try to get pregnant and both times I fell pregnant the first month using it but miscarried. This is a lot cheaper than going to the fertility doctor and works great. There is no need to be guessing or waiting for smiley faces this monitor is great and easy to use. I spent over 6k at a fertility specialist trying to get pregnant and didn't and I spend $150 on this monitor and got pregnant on the first try.
First month using the monitor it gave me 5 days of high and 2 peak days.  However, the second peak day and following high day are automatically programmed - not based on what your test sticks say, so I'm not sure why it requires you to waste your test sticks on these days.  Also from talking to friends and doing more research online, despite the monitor saying it can be used for women with longer cycles, it seems harder for the monitor to identify peaks for them.Personally, I wished that I just stuck with the Clearblue digital ovulation tests - gave me the same info for a lot less money (you can tell when you are getting close to ovulation as your LH line will get darker each day until positive).  Maybe I should have done more research on the monitor beforehand, just not sure yet the cost of the monitor is worth it.  I guess if you have a hard time temping and figuring out when your are ovulating, maybe it will be worth it to you.
Me and my Hubby has been trying to Conceive for a Few Year's, I'm 37 and not getting any younger, so we Decided that we might just not be hitting my ovulation day's like I believed I was. Well after buying the monitor I did find out I was calculating completely wrong.  The monitor is very easy to use. And within a few minute's, it will tell you if your not ovulating, or you hit the high peek to conceive..Just as simple as that...Takes the Guessing in a whole better direction. I would highly recommend this monitor, and you only use about 10 strips thru the month. Hopefully my next review will be that it worked!!!!
After trying for years to get pregnant (using disposable Fertility tabs, timing methods, thermometers, etc.) we decided to see a fertility doctor. After failing at two IUI's and an IVF, we bought this monitor while waiting to do another IVF cycle.  After the third month, my wife became pregnant! This product is easy to use and apparently more accurate than the disposable types. It is also cheaper than IUI's and IVF. Although this monitor may not help every couple get pregnant, I highly recommend trying this product for a few months before seeking more expensive treatments.
I was using the Wondfo ovulation strips before using this, and sometimes I would get a positive ovulation line, and other months nothing, day after day. What was going on was that my cycles were fluctuating between 27 and 41 days. Each month was different, and even though I had bought a lot of ovulation strips, I sometimes ran out before getting a positive. My husband and I gave it our best effort to get pregnant for 5 months. A friend loaned me her Clearblue Easy Fertility Monitor and I started to use it (without resetting it, or anything), and on the first cycle with this, I did not ovulate until day 24. A few weeks later I got my BFP on my pg test. To restate my title of this review: Gem of a product! Worked perfectly for us. If time is of the essence, you should use this!
I seem to have tried just about everything out there.  I would rate the Astroglide product as one of my favorites and one I keep coming back to.  My wife is over 50 now and while she still enjoys sex, but we do sometimes have a lubrication issue.  The problem with the other lubes is they tend to dry out and become very thick especially on the outside where exposed to air, sometimes within 5 minutes of use.  The worse I have tried is the Kroger Brand KY, felt like we had velcro between us.Astroglide is very runny and water like which is one of the reasons we actually like it.  It tends to stay runny and resists thickening when exposed to air.  Eventually it will thicken (which is why four stars), but it seems all lubricants do this eventually, the meantime seems to be longer with this product.
I just tried three of these on and realized that this product would not work for me. I guess this product is not for everyone.  I wonder if this product is suppose to have some scent, because mine does not. I tried to look for a expiration date and guess what!??!!?  THERE IS NO EXPIRATION DATE ON THIS PRODUCT.  This is not a glass mug, or a plastic chair that surely does not require an expiration date. This is a medical product that you use on your body. I just thought this was a really negative aspect of this product, and it is something that the producers should consider fixing.
For some time now, I have had one nostril that seems to get clogged up when I go to bed.  I tried using a decongestant (i.e. Sudafed), and that would usually work.  However, I felt like I was taking too much of it because sometimes I would have to take it nearly every night.  I wanted a non-medicine remedy and so I tried these strips.  I'm very happy I did.  I don't know how they work exactly, but they work.  And I've never had a problem with them coming off at night.  They seem to stick just right.
These definitely open up your nasal passages and functionally work as advertised.  However, the first night I used them I woke up with a bruise-colored mark on the bridge of my nose where the strip was resting.  The next time I tried them, I tried to put it on with more of an arch so it didn't rest against my nose.  It didn't leave a mark in the morning but was surprisingly difficult to pull off and left a sticky residue on my nose that I had to scrub off.  If this is the sensitive skin version, I definitely wouldn't want to try the normal version.  Maybe I will give them another try and try to wear off the stickiness by sticking it to my shirt or something first, but I haven't been to excited about them thus far despite the many positive reviews that others have given.
I really wanted these to work. I seem to get congested at night and these seemed perfect. I tried everything - different kinds of soaps, washing my nose two/three/four times, even different types of towels - but these would just not stay on. Even using two at a time didn't keep them on. They'd only stay on for about an hour and then they'd peel off the sides of my nose and just be stuck to the top. I'm glad they work well for others, but for some reason, they do not stay on for me - and yes, I followed the directions/placement exactly.
These will really hold your passages open, and they stay on extremely well. Nonetheless, if you have oily skin, I suggest cleaning your skin first with alcohol or something. Best to remove it with an alcohol-soaked Q-tip. If your skin gets raw on the bridge of your nose, you can put a tiny amount of lotion, vaseline, or something; but only put it right in the place that's getting sensitive, on the bridge of your nose. It won't stick in that tiny spot, but it'll stick everywhere else and stay on.
These bath wipes are amazing. I cannot get into a bathtub and we are remodeling our shower, so I can't bathe for two weeks. We are one week into the remodeling, and I feel and smell clean. Would I rather be able to take a shower? Of course, I would. But for the next week, that's not in the cards. I am so glad I found these bath wipes. They are thick and super wet, plus they smell good. I would highly recommend them to anyone for any reason.
These are perfect for keeping clean when unable to properly shower or take a bath while recovering from surgery. Here are my observations:+ Thick; holds up well, even with a good amount of scrubbing+ Microwavable; adds to comfort+ Refreshing; these leave me feeling very clean and much better smellingNote that the instructions say the eight cloths in a pack equal one "bath", but I find four more than adequately cleans me up nicely.These work very well and go a long way to making a sick or convalescing person feel much more human.Highly Recommended! I also recommendedComfort Personal Cleansing Shield Incontinence Care Washcloths 32 eato protect "delicate areas" of those who are bedridden.CFH
I bought these for a friend who had surgery and couldn't bathe. I also bought some for myself as I wanted to try them for quick clean ups when I don't have time for a shower. I do shower daily but wanted to try these after taking a walk, or cleaning the house and then need to make a trip to the store. The towels are thick and soft, the scent is kind of odd though, not really fresh or clean smelling. They work okay but are not the best ones on the market.
It says I can't leave feedback I guess I hit something wrong, purchased recently, and I am very pleased with this product. It is a great help to me when I have trouble on bad days, low oxygen, I am on oxygen 24/7, and with these I can still clean up nicely, feeling clean and refreshed when I could not bathe otherwise on bad days, has helped me out greatly. A great product. They use the rinseless soaps in the hospital now so I am very comfortable using them since I discovered them during my last hospital stay.Followup i am so impressed with the thickness of these bathing cloths and with how long they stay wet, so much more than any others that we've used! Very high quality item Thank You!
My husband has COPD & emphysema, he has had 2 collapsed lungs this year and was in the hospital for a month and a half. During his hospital stay the nurses used these wipes to give him a bath. It is hard for him to shower due to the moisture in the air making it hard to breathe. There is also the worry that if he gets short of breath he could pass out in the shower so I have to be there if he wants a real shower for safety. These wipes are the same wipes the nurses used in the hospital and really make it easy for him to see to his hygiene while I'm at work. The price was very reasonable.
I had to go to the doctor and my bath nurse never came.  These "Comfort Bath Cloths" really came to my rescue.  They are an inch or two larger than a regular sized wash cloth.  They are the thickness of felt.  This feels really soft against the body.  The fragrance is fresh, clean and light.  Once you are finished washing the fragrance fades, and you can perfume yourself with the smells you love.  There is not even a whiff of bad orders left after you wash.  "Comfort Bath Cloths" were a delightful surprise that really does what they claim to do.  You won't be disappointed.
These are excellent cleansing washcloths for use on those who can't take care of themselves. The cloths are moist with no rinse soap solution and thick, not thin like the cloth wet wipes ubiquitously available in stores. The thickness is the key-- holds the soap solution and doesn't bunch up while in use. This item is available at Walmart when they have it in stock ( Comfort Bath by Sage Products) but I've experienced problems getting them to keep them in stock.I purchased this item here on Amazon for basically the same price I paid at Walmart except this was delivered to my door. Advice -- watch out with pricing on Amazon a lot of the sellers are asking absolutely ridiculous prices ( item & shipping ) for this item. I've found 2 Amazon sellers whose prices are competitive with Walmart. I've purchased from both and both shipped fast and are recommended.
These wipes are a nice size, sufficiently moist, and thick, what I thought I'd like.  Although I like the thickness, they leave me sticky until the residue finally dries on the skin.  Then they're almost okay, except that I don't feel clean.  I bought them to replace Sam's Club, Simply Right brand, which arrived more dry than wet and weren't as thick.  The Simply Right are 12"X8", so they're slightly larger than these Comfort 8"X8".  Neither brand will exfoliate old skin and residue and they're no substitute for a good shower, but good to have for simple/small clean-ups.  Despite the fact that the Sam's Club brand is dry and not as thick as Comfort Bath, I prefer the Sam's Club.  I simply rinse them for added moisture and to eliminate some of the chemicals, especially the fragrance and carcinogens, which both brands have.
I was given these one time when I was in the hospital, remembered them and now i keep them on-hand for home use.  They really do clean you up,  have a pleasant smell, are soft and comfortable easy to use, and are great for when someone can't get in the bath or shower due to injury or illness.  I found ideal for camping and although you couldn't microwave them, I found you can warm them up with warm water either in a closed package or individually.
After surgery: a must have.On a hot day, getting sweat off after doing a bit of housework, or for washing off dusty feet or even mud on arms, perfect. It's not a shower, but sometimes this is the quickest and quite good enough.I've never heated them, but I may be this winter as am having another surgery and it will be a cold recovery in the winter in CA. Usually I'm in a much hotter year-round climate where I always have a package going.I buy them in bulk, so that rates 5 stars.
Works great! I have tried every deodorant I could find and I always smell when I sweat a lot. It's like I would sweat off the stuff. This stuff is the first I could find that I am not sweating off and I don't smell the next day. I don't really care for the lavender's smell so I will try the fragrance free one next time but it does work great! Plus it is more natural which is a major plus. I had thought since the regular crap deodorant wont work then I would never find a more natural product but I was wrong thanks kiss my face
I guess I thought it would work better. for a deodorant (not antiperspirant), it works okay.  I don't smell lavender at ALL (and I use lavender oil all the time).  It smells like plants.  That's the only way I can describe it. LIke if you rip the leaf off an aloe plant, that sort of &#34;fresh cut&#34; smell.  This is not strong enough for me to wear it out of the house, because it wears off in a couple of hours.  I tried following others' recommendations and just putting a TON of it on in the morning, but it still didn't work. If I ever get pregnant, I'll definitely switch to this to avoid the chemicals during pregnancy, but otherwise I don't see myself using this.
There's been so much in the news lately about the toxicity of cosmetic and personal hygiene products, that I thought it would be nice to try a "natural" deodorant and a friend who has had cancer recommended this one.  On the plus side it truly is fragrance free and it works just fine for a very short periods if you're not exerting yourself.  So, good for running errands, not so good for going to the gym or even for a full work day.  What's more, according to the cosmetic safety database, Mitchum deodorants, which are also anti-perspirants, are no more dangerous than this product and they work a whole lot better.  So unless you really must have a natural product, I'd give this one a pass, especially since the cosmetic safety database rates other natural deodorants as even less toxic than this one.
I have been in the market for a paraben free deoderant and have been using this for 2 months.  Now I don't know if the scented version does a better job at masking odour, and I don't think that I sweat or smell any better or worse than the average person, but this product does nothing to deoderize for me.  And I'm talking about from whether I do light (common day to day living) to moderate activity (playing outside with my kids), this deoderant just does not work from the moment I put it on to a few hours later.  Period.  It's as if I didn't apply anything at all.  I feel that I've given this product a fair chance by wearing it for 2 months regularly.  I wouldn't use this again or recommend this, and I am very disappointed.  The only reason I gave it an extra star is at least the container is a #2 recyclable plastic.
Only reason I gave these two stars is because I got them so cheap and they last for a time. Overall, I find that these ear plugs simply do not last nearly as long as virtually any other ear plug I've used. I might use them for a week and they're shot. The comfort level is good but they quickly get deformed. If I had my choice, I used to use these 3m ear plugs and a set of those would last nearly two months. But I have a hard time finding those anymore. *sigh
I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I quit using vaseline! This product is VERY Pricey as I paid $16+ for a tub at the store. This is the best healing lotion for dry spots even on my face (NOT EVERY DAY THOUGH) and "THE BeST" chapstick I have ever tried! This made my dry,cracked winter lips that peel almost every day to every other day with constant use of chapstick (that didn't help) restore my lips...YES this stuff restored my lips back to when I was a baby lol it is so soft and even when you apply at night before bed you still wake up with it moisturized!!! WILL REPURCHASE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE!
Do not waste your money.  This thermometer only measure 1/10 of a decimal point and it is such a pain to use.  It remembers your last temperature and displays that instead of taking your current temp when you turn it on.  There is only one blue button and I have yet to figure out how to make it start recording my temp - I push the blue button once and it shows yesterday's temp, hit it again and it flashes blank but nothin else happens.  The beeping while it records (when it finally starts!) is pretty quiet and I don't really mind that.  I just wish it worked consistently and actually measured the extra decimal point.  I've been using this to help diagnose hypothyroidism, but I would not recommend this thermometer for any purpose!
This is a basic basal thermometer which I use for NFP. I found out about it from the book Taking Charge of Your Fertility - a system which I totally love and recommend for every girl/woman. This thermometer works well and quickly. I've been using it for a few months now with no issues whatsoever. It is a good quality thermometer - and it has even stood up to my toddler's "attention" - when she finds it and presses the buttons a million times before I can intervene :)Very good product that can serve many purposes and definitely serves mine!
I ordered the BD brand BBT and got this lavender colored Nexcare BBT model instead.  It's back lit which is quite nice in the dark in the morning.  I'm not sure it's all that accurate though -- sometimes I'll take my temp again right away to double check and it will be .2 to .3 off.  On my old BD brand which wasn't even a BBT, it was usually no more than .1 or .2 off if I redid it immediately.  The beeping is pretty quiet and doesn't bother me.
Been using this every morning to try to track ovulation. Its quick and accurate (from what I can tell).My one complaint is it beeps the whole time its taking your temperature. If you are getting this for ovulating, you know that you have to take your temperature FIRST thing in the morning (preferably before you get out of bed). I wake up for work before my husband so I don't really want to be laying in bed while this thermometer beeps continuously and annoying the heck out of him... So I end up just taking my temperature in another room after I get up.. which makes it less accurate.So if it didn't do the annoying beeping I would have given 5 stars. For someone tracking ovulation, it really is a hindrance to have to get a less accurate reading just because the darn thing won't stop beeping.
I'm very happy with this purchase. I've been using this thermometer almost every morning for about 2 weeks now and it seems consistent and accurate. The beeping sometimes seems loud since the device is right next to your head, but it's never disturbed my husband or the baby who sleeps in our room. I opt to cover the little speaker hole with my finger to mute the beep even more.I like the constant beep so I know that it's working and I have it positioned correctly.I think the best thing about this thermometer is how quick it is compared to regular thermometers I've used in the past. I don't want to be stuck in bed for 3 extra minutes when I need to be cooking breakfast and getting the kids up. This thing is done in under a minute every time.
I have used FAM to chart for close to 3 years now, and after a few months I ordered this digital Basal thermometer. I LOVE it. I use it every day and have only had to change the battery once so far, which is amazing.I take my temp at 6:30am every day, and usually go back to sleep. This thermometer beeps to indicate that it is in the correct position, and the beeping keeps me *just awake enough* that I don't fall asleep and screw up temping. It can be a little louder than I (and my husband) would like, but I discovered that if I place my thumb over the back where the battery goes in, it muffles it a bit. My husband doesn't even notice anymore, and I am never going to a different bbt thermometer if I can help it!
I've had coccyx pain for a few months and I just new I had to find something for a trip that would involve 14 hrs straight on a train and  several 5 hour day trips. It needed to be durable, packable and cleanable. This was the perfect find. It's made of sturdy rubber, it inflates very quickly to your desired level. It's very easy to clean with a lysol towel and the best thing is that I was able to carry it in my purse during those day trips when not in use. It takes the space of a sweater, it folds in 4 when not inflated leaving you with about 12&#34; triangles. It's not very light even when not inflated but the comfort it gives my back is worth carrying around. I even carried it around during a tennis tournament and the relief it gives my back is so worth it. Recommended for those with back pain.
After trying a dozen different creams and a supplement, I think getting pressure off hemorrhoids is the only way I can keep them calmed down. I ordered one for the car as well. Sturdy, made of thick rubber, affordable; wish it had a removable, washable cover to match, but overall it's a keeper. I just slip it into a pillow case for aesthetics. It does have a rubber smell, because it's new rubber. I suspect over time, the new car smell will fade like most of these types of products. Now I am going to look for a hot water bottle too.
What can I say. It works great. Only those with hemorrhoids can understand the relief this little tube can bring.This small inner tube sits on the toilet seat. Drape a steamy hot towel over the top, then sit on it. It offers much relief once seated on the hot, moist towel. Remain seated for 15 minutes or so, and Voila! Relief at last.Amazon also has the Sitz bath available, which offers a small tub of water which sits on the toilet seat. Rather than the towel pressure, you actually feel the hot water.The pressure of a steaming towel always worked better for me. But, either of these items is reasonably priced so that you could try one or both at a small price for the relief they offer.
This is my second one of these. I have a deformed tailbone which is prone to bruising (not great for a girl who rides horses!) so I keep one of these in my car for my long commute to and from work. I also use one for my riding lawn mower. Really saves my tush from being sore.These things last a long time, too. My first one is several years old (and I am no light-weight!) and still going strong. My only complaint (and it's not much of one, at that) is that when I mow on it, the older one leaves a faint ring of red/orange color on my bum.  Really not a big deal, especially since it has lasted for so long (sitting in my boiling hot and freezing cold car). These things are TOUGH!
ALlllright, so I broke his tailbone somehow and needs a Donut Cushion.Pro: it fits fine, inflate easily, you can spot it from miles away since it's bright red, helps relieve my tailbone while sitting. A great conversation starter.Con: it STINKS of rubber, I've cleaned it, aired it, used it for almost 1 month now and it's still stinky. You can spot it from miles away since it's bright red.If you don't mind the cons, get it.
The price is right, and the product is great.  My Mom is a senior with COPD and other serious health issues, and this has been a life saver for her.  She can soak as long as she wants to help her feel "refreshed."  We use a small tub, filled with fragrant bubble bath, to soak her feet, and this methods lets her maintain her dignity, when she can't make it upstairs to take a full tub bath.  When this one cracks or begins to wear out, I will certainly buy another.God bless the inventor of the Sitz bath!!!
The shipping box was in good shape but the product box arrived opened and the inner sealing bag was open as well.  The product had multiple hairs on it, various other dirt, and oily rub marks were visible in light where perhaps someone attempted to rub it down to clean it. The inner bag's sealing tie was broken and the product box appeared banged up and used. The overall impression I got from the product and it's inner packaging was that it had been used.  Needless to say, I will not be attempting to use it.  In a hygiene-sensitive item like this, cleanliness is paramount.  The thing should be sparkling. Great care should be taken to provide NEW, clean products, and especially so when selling products for the "nether regions". Disappointed with this transaction but thankfully Amazon allowed a quick refund.
I had to have a rectal fistulotomy and hemorrhoidectomy. I am a plus sized woman (wear sz 26-28)  and was so worried about finding a sitz bath that would &#34;hold up&#34; through my recovery.  This was a blessing!  The pan is STRONG and I used it daily x4 weeks without any cracking or problems.  We have an elongated toilet bowl, the lid did not fit over the pan, but it was no big deal.  The pan is comfortable to sit on directly.  I am thrilled with the purchase.
Woah, does it work!! I had to cut back on the intervals recommended on the directions, just so I could go out and be human.But it SURE cleanses!After cutting back on my own specific dosage, it still worked but I didn't have to "run out of the office" several times a day.......It's a good cleanse!! And yes, I DO recommend it for you Amazonians out there -- just try it at home for the first few days to get an idea of what it does for you, as you may have to adjust your dosage too.
If your thinking about getting this, becuase of the review rating, think again.  This stuff is terrible.  It did nothing but give me a stomach ache.  I'm not a huge health fanatic that knows all about the detox and clease process.  A year ago I took Yerba Prime and it worked really well.  I decided to try this one, becuase it was cheaper.  Well you definitely get what you pay for.  I do not recommend this product at all.  Horrible!!
I just finished the 30 day cleanse last week.  I did it for the entire 30 days.  I never used the bathroom so much in my life - but it was a wonderful thing.  I felt "cleaned" out and I like that - the bloating went away, my tummy was flatter, my skin looked brighter and I lost 6 pounds!!  However, one week after the cleanse I have gained most of it back and I am feeling constipated again - this is not a permanent cleanse but I definitely enjoyed feeling great for 30 days.  I would try this product again.
I am just starting with the product today and to be the first day I can tell it is working because I went to the bathroom nicely, I can say at first you feel like a tickling sensation in your abdomen like a feeling that you gonna get diarrhea but is not; that's just the fact that it is working and cleaning your colon and you feel like that.I wont be explicit but I took a nice day in the toilet =)So far is working for me...!!!
I am in the military and I work hard at eating clean. Sometimes in the field for work though I can't avoid eating &#34;Army food&#34;. It is not clean or healthy. the point of Army chow is to fill you up and keep you in enough carbs and calories to keep you going to harsh conditions. Well I am a small female that gains fat very easy. I take two of each in the morning and two of each at night and it really keeps me happy. I don't get bloated or fatigued from all the heavy food. I don't think it will keep weight off but it will keep it from slowing you down during low hot training.P.s. You shouldn't take this stuff for too long as it contains a tree bark that can darkness your colon and make it hard for doctors to see anything going on down there during testing. Also for a couple of people I know it makes them have to run to the bathroom often so I would start slow.
I've been buying this product off and on for 5+ years from a local vitamin store.  The price on Amazon is slightly cheaper.  I use these when I travel and whenever I want to &#34;detox&#34; my system especially after holidays when I eat stuff I don't typically eat and after indulging in too many spirits or when I am kicking off a new diet or when I just feel bloated and ugh.  I have never done a complete cycle (ie take daily until they are all gone).  Instead I generally take them for a few days or a week.  I like these better than the occassional laxative which for some reason make me very uncomfortable no matter how &#34;gentle&#34; they claim to be.
And I trust the purit of their products and the products of their research. Creatine Fuel Stack Performance is my latest purchse. I bought it to help supplement my efforts to help heal the shoulder (&#34;Frozen Shouulder&#34; which I could feel coming on since last summer) that I pretty much messed up by overdoing the heavy schlepping (many book-filled boxes, and a dorm fridge that I picked up and carried for 30 feet). I am a skinny melinky -- I should not be doing the afore-mentioned but no one else was around...and, well.. it had to be done. So my doctor put me on painkillers, which helped but which I could only take for 7 - 10 days max. Here is where the Creatine comes in-- knowing from past experience how it seemed to revive me after my (pre-frozen shoulder) workouts,.I figured it might help reduce the pain and limited mobility of my shoulder on my off-the-painkiller days. And it certainly seems to be doing just that.
I've been using this product for a few times already.  I have also tried other brand and stop using creatine for comparision.  Therefore, I can honestly say this product is solid and delivery the result I expect consistantly.For the record, my expectation from what a Creatine Monohydrate should offer is very realistic.  An extra rep or two plus slightly faster recovery is all that I want.  Nothing miraculous, no fuller muscle, no strength gain bull craps or anything else.  This product give me that.  I notice the different when I am not taking it.It might be my body, I've never experienced any bloating effect at all.  I drink between 1 to 2 litre of water a day.  My only comlain about this product is the pill is large and they can get sticky if your hand is wet.
I don't understand why they can't take less filler in these products and add more product.  Why does it take 6 pills to equal 5gr Creatine?  This could be accomplished in 3.  So you think you're getting a deal with 180 pills when you're only receiving 30 days worth of product.  I've decided to seek my protein and creatine in one supplement.  A powder with what I want/need.  I don't think the price for a 30 day supply is justifiable in 180 pills.  Just my opinion.
This Creatine is good for OFF SEASON. Meaning This is the kind of creatine you take when you're not training as hard. This is the SAFEST creatine I've ever tried there is literally no side affects. The reason why this creatine doesn't work as fast or intense as the others is because 1) I've open 8 capsules and put it into a cup and it doesn't even equal to 1 scoop of what you would use from another brand 2) There aren't as many ingredients. Even GNC Creatine XXX which is their version of Cell Mass etc if you look on the back labels of those products there is a lot of ingredients. Yes this isn't the craziest creatine you'll ever try but you won't get any side affects. This is perfect for when you're body is healing and you want to keep your pumps without overdosing on creainte all year long.
I was absolutely suffering before I came across the reviews for this product. I couldn't breathe for MONTHS, I thought I was going to have to get some kind of surgery or something. I was popping nasal decongestant pills like M&Ms, to no avail. But holy cow, this stuff is amazing!! One caveat: it won't work if your nose is 100% blocked (which mine USUALLY was), because obviously you need to be able to inhale to use this. But when you get a little break in the action and there's even a hint of a clear airway, pop this baby in, inhale and BREAAAAATHE!!! Love it, love it, love it.
I had a pretty bad cold (maybe the flu) and needed some decongesting. This stuff worked pretty well when I could inhale enough to get a decent dose. When I couldn't, it wasn't much use. Unfortunately I did get some stinging & burning, too (some of the side-effects). I also wish the decongesting effect lasted longer as sometimes it didn't seem to last very long though that might have been because I was seriously congested and may not have been able to inhale enough of the medicated vapors.Note that it says on the packaging that you should not use it for more than 3 days, and that frequent or prolonged use may cause nasal congestion to recur or worsen... so one should probably not come to rely on using this product heavily.But the product did provide some much wanted relief.
I have a chronic problem with nasal congestion; I have one of those narrow noses which sometimes gets stopped up. I have found the Benzedrex inhaler to be very helpful in providing quick relief when I'm out. The effects are good for about two hours when the inhaler is new and then began to taper off as it ages.I have one in my pocket at this very moment and am pleased to say that I haven't needed it all day; there is comfort in knowing that it's there if I do need it.I've found it works better than any other inhaler that I've used that is available over the counter.
It does work, but I found it more effective at some times rather than others.  It seemed better at making stronger congestion less noticeable than it did in reducing slight congestion down to nothing.  In other words, I felt little relief if congestion was minor, but very noticeable relief when I was more congested.The one other complaint I have is that I found it slightly difficult to use at times of heavier congestion - or at least, less effective...because think about it - it's a NOSTRIL inhaler... if you are congested, getting a good inhale through the nostrils could be difficult.  A good strong inhale is needed because there is this "ball-like" mechanism that lifts up in the inhaler that seemed to allow more vapors through.  To combat weak inhales, I simply tipped it upside down during use.Size is similar to lip balm, so it's easily pocketable.
I love these inhalers. I stumbled across it at either CVS or RiteAid once and I can't imagine being without it. I've actually been searching for them at drugstores but cant find them again, I'm SO happy Amazon carries it. Amazon Rocks!!If you have a stuffy nose from allergies or a cold, this seriously clears you up right away and keep you clear for hours.  Inhale and soon you'll no longer have a stuffy nose. It works great to prevent snoring too.Vic's inhaler only works for a short period of time. This one works really really well!
I have chronic sinus problems, and allergies, especially to cats.  This product works within MINUTES, even when my sinuses are swollen nearly shut!  It's not very well known, which is a shame, because it's the only thing that makes my life livable around cats.  I buy extra whenever I see them, because they're hard to find locally, and I always want to have one or two around because I HATE not having it when I need it.I highly recommend this product, it is THE best decongestant ever, and works instantly!
MyVicks Vapor Inhalerseemed to have run out of decongestant, so I wanted to buy another one. I saw the reviews for this product on Amazon and decided to give it a try. Wow, they were not kidding, this stuff is strong! Just a couple of sniffs, and my nose was no longer blocked. It even made my eyes tear, it's that strong. I'm glad a bought a three pack, because I intend to keep one in my purse, one in the bathroom, and one by my bed. Great product.
I cannot give this product a great rating, because it was not what I needed for my dry eyes. It is kind of thick, but your visions clears fast after blinking a few times and it melts in your eyes. It is very lubricant like ans makes the eyes moist for a long time. My problem is, my dry eyes are caused by allergies, so they not only get very dry but they get very red and itchy. This product does nothing for red, and itchy dry eyes, but it probably very good for normal non-allergy dry eyes.
This was purchased as a replacement for the first aid kit in an old home 3 day emergency kit, and I'm very satisfied with the purchase.  Although it says that it is an outdoor kit, it has most of the things from our old kit, plus a number of others. There were, however, a few other things that we purchased separately to add in that you may also want to purchase: electrolyte tablets, insta cloths (condensed cloths that expand with water), iodine tablets, benadryl tablets, and small bottle of bleach (not really first aid, but we keep it in the kit as an emergency water disinfection option).There was a large enough quantity of many items that I took a portion of some of them and put them into a fanny pack for our very small hiking/outdoor first aid kit.Overall, very good and I would buy this kit again as the most complete one I could find for the intended purpose.
To be honest I bought this one in haste without any research of any other kits and I don't regret it one bit. Although its a bit unorganized it has everything you need and is very simple and compact. I was looking through the other kits today and they barely give a description of what comes with it (the ones that are the same size as this one). The case is a bit soft but the orange color stands out whenever someone needs to find it. I keep this one in my car and I'm probably going to buy one for my house soon.
This is exactly the kit I was looking for to keep in my ATV.  It contains a generous supply of the basics for injuries and minor wounds that might occur in remote areas. Although it contains two small rolls of medical tape, I've found that a large roll of tape sufficient to wrap sprained ankles, wrists or to bandage a puncture wound always comes in handy.  Add that item.  This kit is light-weight and fits perfectly into an ATV saddle bag.  The flexible nylon container allows for extra items that might be desired - and the bright-orange color keeps it easily visible in the woods if you are working an emergency away from the vehicle, so you will not lose it in the leaves.
This product came shipped promptly, and came just as advertised as the title says.We purchased this first-aid kit for our bug-out kits.  As an adjunct, we added a few other things like different gauses and some creams in order to 'beef it up' so to speak.  Nothing wrong with it!  We were just personalizing it a bit, since we have a few people that might need a few other allergy pills and such more often than not.This product would be great for bug out bags, get home bags, camping trips or simply to have around the home.  We are VERY glad to have gotten it and it beats anything you would be able to get at the store for the price.  Highly recommend it.
Thank you so much for this company!!! Now I'm very confident about my self and become more positive person!!!I wasn't able to eat a junk food or chocolate before because make my skin really bad, but now at least I'm able to eat some chocolate. I been having a horrible acne since when I was 15years old, (now I'm 20) and I try a lot of product and went to dermatologist but didn't work at all. I was about to try acuten but I know the side effect is very bad but works really well (they said) but I just decided to  try this product since the review was great. I wish they sale this in local store such a king soopers or wal-mart becasue I don't really buy a stuff in Amazon and shipping was like $6 so its kind a expensive.
I am a 28y and have suffered from acne for years! I bought this because of all the reviews and now I am halfway through the pills and everyone has noticed! The only thing I'd like is a supply of the pills and the pills alone as I don't really care for the ointment. I am wondering if anyone has tried clearzine... seems to be the same thing but just the pills but I am reluctant to switch to something I don't know anything about. I will be purchasing this again for now and now that I know something actually works I'll be recommending it to others. I don't understand why doctors do not recommend this if it works so well.
Homeopathic is just a fancy way of saying placebo. Its all about what you believe. I did extensive research after I bought these because it was not working for me. It might have worked, but a placebo is broken once you arent convinced it isnt doing what it says. If you want something to believe in to make you think your skin is clearing up, then this is perfect for you. However if you are looking for something that is going to ACTUALLY do something, you need to find another product.
Bought for my face but have ended up using it for massage/after bath/body oil.  It is NOT 100% vitamin e but an oil blend, though a very nice blend with a nutty smell.  Warning: my cat goes nuts for this so I don't dare leave it open (learned once - he knocked and spilled it) and have to keep it out of their reach.  Not sure if all cats are like mine ;-)  But for humans it's a nice and soft oil, great for sensitive skin and will leave your body glowing.
I'm surprised nobody is talking about the smell of this oil. I'm super sensitive to odors, and the minute I opened the bottle, I was sorry I ordered it. I would describe it for you, but I've never smelled anything like it, sort of cheap perfumy, like those car deodorizers people hang from their mirrors......or that smell that hits you when you walk into a public restroom. I don't want to use it on my face or anywhere that I can smell it, though the scent does dissipate fairly quickly.Why would they want to add a scent? I thought "Jason" products were all about being natural. Pure vitamin E isn't the greatest scent in the world, but I'd much rather they hadn't tried to mask it.I gave it 2 stars because it's a nice enough texture, and I'll probably use it, or at least keep it until it's too rancid, but I won't purchase again.
I am allergic to both almonds and apricots. This product is advertised as "Pure vitamin E" with no ingredients list. I take vitamin E and have used vitamin E oil before, and never have I seen one containing almond and apricot oils. I am SOOOO glad I read the ingredients. I almost didn't, didn't occur to me that I needed to, but as the bath was filing, I turned it around and read it. Just goes to show that one should always, always be careful when dealing with allergies. Needless to say, I'm relived that I read the ingredients and disappointed that this wasn't listed anywhere on the Amazon site. Many people are allergic to nuts. This product is going in the garbage.
I mixed a capful of this Vitamin E oil with a cup of coconut oil in a plastic bottle and use a little each night as a moisturizer before I go to bed. My skin is dry but this doesn't goop it up at all. My skin absorbs it quickly and leaves my face feeling smooth and hydrated. i also mix this into my hair oil mix (Black Castor, Coconut, Jojoba) and it has worked wonders. This is always good to have on hand, the smaller bottle is best since it doesn't stay fresh forever.
I do not smoke but I bought this because I read scientific studies that it is suppose to help with memory and help prevent the onset of Alzheimer's which runs rampant in my family. Both of my parents died with it.  It does in fact improve short term memory but it had a second effect I didn't expect and that is it helped to do away with my crazy appetite. I have lost 15 lbs since putting this patch on every day.  The only side effect I can tell that might bother some people is it makes your arm or wherever you put it on your body itch just temporarily for a few minutes after application. If you use it make sure you change up the place you put it each day.
I like this stuff better than any of the high end stuff I can find.  It is great for skin with acne.  It is a very grainy scrub.  It is NOT one of those really fine sand particle like scrubs that are the usual on the market.  This one is different.  There is another one that says it is for acne, but has salycylic acid.  This one does not.  I did not want to irritate my skin by adding that.  I use this and then my Peter Thomas roth benzoyl peroxide wash.  It keeps me from scratching my skin with my acne.  This stuff is different than other things on the market and is not oily if you are concerned about that.
The blemish and blackhead control version of the ST. Ives Apricot Scrub is a great face wash for removing makeup, and for exfoliating old skin from your face. This consistency of this formula is thicker than most face washes, and the particles in it that make up the abrasive scrub are densely packed, so you get a ton of scrubbing cream in just a small amount of product. Much more exfoliation power than in the original Apricot Scrub version. It's great for removing long wearing, color-stay foundation, which tends to need something with a little extra scrubbing power in it to get all of it off of your skin. It cleans out pours and leaves skin super smooth, without drying it out. It works quite well, and it's been a favorite face wash of mine for well over 10 years now.
I've been using St. Ives Apricot Scrub since it was introduced back in the mid-1970's and it's a fantastic product!!  I always get the 'Blemish Control' version, not because I have acne anymore (I'm nearly 60), but because the coarseness of the scrub removes all the dead skin and leaves my face glowing with fresh, smooth skin.  People who meet me for the first time can't believe I'm even over 40.  Ok, that's part genetics, but I also give credit to this wonderful face scrub and my Jergens lotion.
I was a little apprehensive to try this scrub because I usually buy much more expensive scrubs and this was only a couple of dollars.  But this is the best scrub I have ever used. It was only about $2.50 on S&S and it was better than the $25 - $30 scrubs from department store brands.  It smells good and your face feels fresh, clean and soft after using it.  It takes off all the dead skin so your makeup goes on smoother.  It has all natural exfoliants so they will break down after you wash them down the drain and not build up in your septic tank or sewers.
I don't like this product. It is way too rough on my sensitive skin. It's my fault though. I thought I was getting the new cleanser and I bought the scrub instead. So I am giving this product 3 stars. I am sure people love it. It is just too abrasive for my face. My entire face turned red and looked irritated when I used this product. I love the new apricot fresh skin cleanser. It has the exfoliating beads but it is gentle. If you have sensitive skin, try that product. Don't use this product if you have hyper sensitive skin like I do.
I bought this one instead of my usual St. Ives that is a bit more coarse and found this one worked great for my skin.  Though I like both I found this is perfect for both me and my hubby who has more sensitive skin.  I use this once a week and moisturize afterwards with a neutragena moisturizer with sunscreen.  I feel like when I use it is makes my skin glow and it feels great.  This, combined with using sunscreen, eating (fairly) healthy and drinking enough fluids has really helped my skin to look good and to make me feel younger.  I would highly recommend.  I would say my skin is not necessarily sensitive but hubby's is and he had no issues.  His skin tends to be dry/normal and mine more normal/oily and did a great job for both of us!
My fiance has had acne since he was a teenager. He's tried several things, to no avail, which is understandably frustrating. I have used this scrub for awhile, and I noted to him that it was actually the thing that kept my own skin nice and clear - the exfoliation helped to scrub the skin nice and clean, and the salicylic acid helped to prevent new blemishes from appearing.My fiance's skin is noticeably clearer. He had tried a stronger salicylic acid lotion prescribed by his dermatologist, but that had some unpleasant side effects, while doing nothing to clear his skin. The only thing that has actively cut down on the amount of facial blemishes has been the apricot scrub. I ended up purchasing several new tubes of the scrub because it was now disappearing twice as fast.I've never minded his skin issues, but it makes me happy to see him happier with his skin. It's certainly not a miracle product, and it doesn't eliminate every blemish, but the difference is certainly clear.
I have severe acne and I have tried just about everything including high dose salicylic acid.  One time I stumbled upon an article that says that dead skin cells that clogs the skin essentially cause the skin harder to breath, therefore pimples keep reappearing.  makes sense, so I bought the scrub.  I tried the Loreal, it was okay, but the scrub particles are finer in loreal.  St Ives is more coarse and left smoother skin.  One month after using this product, my face is visibly cleaner.  I have occasional one or two zits, but overall my face is much better.  I use it daily.  The instruction says not to use it that often.
I have heard many times that this isn't good for your skin because of the tiny sharp pieces used to exfoliate.  However, I only use it about once every two weeks for a &#34;deep cleaning&#34; and am very gentle when using it.  It just seems to do a much better job with the deep, penetrating exfoliation than anything else on the market that I have tried.  Other brands have the round pieces which seem to just roll around on my skin instead of gripping or scraping off the dead skin.  My skin doesn't feel much different after using other brands.
This is a great exfoliating scrub for your face I live by.The smell and fragrance is excellent and the texture of the beads are GREAT for getting rid of blemishes and smoothing out your skin.Try not to use this everyday as it can damage your skin after prolonged use. I would suggest using this 2-3 times a week at the end of the day.Try for a softer and milder facewash for the morning.The cost of this item is very cheap and excellent for its worth. HIGHLY recommend both Men and Women to have this in their bathroom.Price/Value: 5/5Effectiveness/Cleaning power: 5/5Fragrance/Smell: 5/5Cleaner Skin : 100/5
This products works! I don't have skin problems, but I was looking for something to keep my skin fresh. I use it about 3 times a week, and each time I feel very refreshed. I've used this product for a few months. Unless you're using a gallon each time, this product should last for a while.Pros:- Refreshing- scrub cleans the skin without being overly abrasive- Smells niceCons:- none that I can think ofOverall: 5/5. This is a quality product that really keeps the skin fresh.
This stuff is great. I have read mixed reviews before that say the product is too harsh for your skin, but I love it. I definitely don't use it daily because I think that *would* be too harsh, but I love it for those days when I need a deeper clean and a nice exfoliation. It smells great and it always leaves my skin feeling great. I don't know that I'd recommend it to those with very sensitive skin, but it's also really inexpensive so it may be worth a purchase just to see how your skin reacts to it.
I have been using St. Ives apricot face scrub for past 8 years and I never found it being worse than other more expensive drug store face scrubs. I'd say this scrub is better than other big brand babies. The scent is very pleasant, and the scrub does not irritate the skin nor breaks it out. I have used a LOT of different brands and types and I experienced variety of side effects like super dry skin, more pimples and irritation. This scrub cleanses your face squeaky clean, it clears acne and leaves your face SO refreshed and soft! Cheaper than all other scrubs in the drug stores yet more effective than all of them combined! I also like the green tea scrub by this same brand. So try it out as well.
After reading a lot in magazines about this scrub I decided to give it a try. After all, it's so cheap that I had nothing to lose. I have been pleasantly surprised. I really like the smell and my face feels really smooth after using it. When I combine it with an electric facial brush or a face sponge it works even better. I don't feel it has encouraged any breakouts in my acne-prone skin but I'm careful and prefer not to use it whenever I feel my skin is breaking out.
I have used this for years. But recently noticed that St. Ives is now part of Unilever. The package no longer says &#34;no animal testing&#34;. Where it used to say that now just says Unilever. And I think Unilever does do animal testing :(There may be some ingredient differences, too. I compared it to a old tube I found laying around and noticed that there used to be more flower extracts and botanicals. Now the only natural extract is apricot.This use to be 5-star product for me but with the changes, I'm dropping it to 3. Hopefully Unilever will bring back the natural ingredients that made St. Ives special. And maybe they'll stop animal testing, too.The scrub does still work though.
he apricot scrub is great for removing regular makeup with its gentle but tough formula. I just tried out the apricot scrub and not only does it smell wonderful, it leaves skin soft and touchable.  You can really feel it going to work and exfoliating as  soon as you rub it in. It not only removes makeup but dry skin. Whenever I use St Ives I see a remarkable decrease in whiteheads and blackheads. This scrub is perfect for both adults and teens. Most importantly, its made from natural ingredients.
I have sensitive dry skin with mild rosacea and was looking for something that could scrub off the dead dry skin but not irritate my face too much. I started using this and was initially happy with the results. It worked well and left my skin feeling clean and dead skin free. About 4 or 5 uses in, everything changed. My skin broke out into this weird texture. I had tiny skin-colored little bumps all over my face and my face felt like sand paper. I've never seen my skin do this before. Everywhere I had used this scrub was bumpy and irritated. My skin wasn't red but it felt like it was crawling and very irritated. I immediately stopped using this and after a week or so of just water, my skin finally started to clear up.Needless to say I will NOT be using this anymore. I guess my skin either didn't like something in this scrub or is just too sensitive.
I've tried several exfoliating scrubs over the years. Most of them significantly more expensive than St.Ives.This scrub is effective. The grains are large enough to clean out pores and exfoliate off dead skin. St. Ives also makes a sensitive skin formula, which is obviously gentler on the skin.My husband and I have oily skin and large pores. We love this scrub and use it daily. Nothing keeps pores cleaner, and the price simply cannot be beat. If you don't have oily skin you probably only want to use this 2-3 times per week.We order this through the Subscribe & Save problem so that we never run out. We even buy the travel size tubes so we don't get clogged pores when on trips.
This is my favirote skin product to pamper myself with. The smell really isn't that great (I think they need to introduce something which really does smell like apricots), but it is very effective at removing dirt and oil from the skin.This product should be applied in the bath or shower. It is very messy and has a tendency to glop everywhere. Plus the acne medication can stain fabrics.I also strongly recomend purchases of the larger sizes because I go through the little tubes on a regular basis.
I am a guy who has been using Pro Active and several other expensive products since I was a teenage...Yikes, that's over 10 years now! My Wife convinced me to at least give the St. Ives product a try so I did. As usual, I got a pimple or two while switching to the new product but my face is now clearer than ever. What I also noticed about other brands is that if I stopped using them for a couple days (ie: road trip, business travel, etc.) I would be ridden with Acne for weeks as a punishment! Now with the St. Ives I don't get that same reaction, I don't have to worry about dry flaky skin, and its at a fraction of the cost. If this review was helpful, please give me a thumbs up :)
I hadn't used St. Ives Apricot Scrub in years because I'd moved on to higher priced and - I assumed - better scrubs. Just tried this scrub again and I was very pleasantly surprised! It really has changed: the scrub particles are finer than they used to be and, even though they provide fabulous exfoliation, there is nothing abrasive about this newer version. If you haven't used St. Ives Apricot Scrub in a while, I suggest you give it another try. I'm thrilled with it and have even started using it on my legs in the shower. Love it!
I love this product and use it to wash my face every morning and night.  The paste has decent sized scrubbing particles to get dirt off your face, but as long as you don't press too hard with your hands/washcloth, it shouldn't be too abrasive for your skin.  After using it, my face feels shiny and smooth.  Make sure to apply facial lotion after cleaning your face though, to avoid drying out your skin.Also, the smell is wonderful!This product also came with a sample of St. Ives Skin Renewing Collagen Elastin Body Lotion.  That stuff smelled funky, and I did not like it very much.
I have been using this product to help me recover from my scalp recover fromthe hair loss I suffered due to my iodine deficiency.  This is my 2nd time ordering andin my opinion it is worth shot.  I could actually start to notice baby hair sprouting around the12th day of use.  But put this on your scalp when it is dry and not wet.  If you wash your hair wait a full 24-30 hours before you put it in your scalp.  I believe the directions say that also but I realized that pending onwhether you use a shampoo with parabens or sulfates and other ick in it you don't want your hair tobecome taffy so Please wait 24 hrs.
I use breath strips every night, they really help me breath better.  I have been buying the small/med tan ones for some time.  I do not like the feeling of the clear plastic ones, and the large size is just huge.  I decided to give the menthol ones a try, since they came in the sm/med size and the tan fabric style.  I like them, but I don't know that I can tell an actual difference.  I think I'll keep a box on hand for those days when I'm really congested, like when I have a cold.  In those cases perhaps it will help just a tad and make me feel better.  Maybe it would just be in my head (pun intended!), but to be perfectly honest if it makes me feel better than whatever, right?
I wanted to comment but every one here has said it all. Huge compartments which I need for all kinds of supplements. Strong construction and unlike some reviews the compartments close securely. Now for travel the thing is so big any strong movement of the bag can open it. I would run Scotch tape over it and yes if your pills are sensitive to light you need to keep this box in a draw. I'm not going to give it less than five stars because these drawbacks don't effect me and I have had a lot of trouble finding a pill box that would hold my supplements.  Oh yes its size and the reason you bought this thing may annoy you some if space is a problem in your overnight bag.
I have two of these, and although each compartment is only partially filled, the lids pop open and spill the contents.  This happens much more often with this size, than with the regular size.  I have to tape the lids closed after each filling.The size is nice.  But you can see a gap between each lid and the bottom, so they let humidity in more than the regular size.I would prefer the kind with a single lid, and 9 compartments, each about the same size as these, but this is no longer available.
I take a lot of supplements.  In fact, I am personally responsible for the "vitamin and supplement industry bailout program" (Mr. President, you can thank me later).  Anyway, I have never found a pill container that would hold all my supplements.  I have the size smaller than this one and I would try cramming everything in there and praying the lid would close (and stay closed).  The 3XL size is PERFECT!  My only regret is that I didn't buy 3 or 4 more.
I have pills I have to take in the morning and some at night.  I've been using some 2X boxes that my retired-nurse wife got from drug reps at the clinic.The problem is that they were too small.  My vitamin, Glucosimine-Condroitin, Fish Oil, Welchol and Co-Q10 capsules are all huge. Just those five things add up to nine capsules in the morning batch and five in the evening.  Then add in my aspirin, BP meds, Lexapro, Plavix, Niaspan a few others...Anyway, everything is solved with these 3X containers.One holds all my morning meds for a week with room to spare.  Yes, even with nine large capsules.  The other holds my evening meds with LOTS of room left over.The only thing I wish is that I could have gotten one in a different color or perhaps tinted a bit darker to make it REALLY obvious which held my nighttime meds.
This has nice, large, daily container pockets to easily hold a lot of pills or several big pills for each day. The lids on each day's pockets snap on very tight and don't have a big lip for pulling up to open. I find the lids a little hard to pop free, so it's a balance between knowing the lids will stay closed and easily opening them. It meets my needs very nicely, but I'm not sure I'd recommend this for someone with arthritic hands or not much hand strength.
Some people have complained about the size (either too large. . . or too small). . .but no one has posted a picture, so I just did.  If you take quite a few medications. . . or supplements.. . . or both. . . then this pillbox might be for you.  I actually have two of them. .  one for AM and one for PM.  They are easy to open. . . I like that they are clear so you can see if you have left anything inside. . . the lids stay shut. . . I've had one for several years, and it's still going strong. . . I really can't think of anything bad to say about them.  They also have braille in the corner of the lid.
This pill box is does what it should. It opens easily, snaps shut securely and holds your pills. It's solid and labeled for the days of the week in an easy-to-read way. But be warned, it's jumbo just like it says in the description so depending on your needs it might actually be too big. You can get at least 6 horse pills into each section or about 50 little ones. Whatever your pill needs are this container should be big enough. The container itself is quite long so take that into consideration if you plan to carry it around. If you're looking for a smaller pill reminder I recommend the Apothecary 7 day 7 Sided Medium Pill Reminder.
While it is exactly what it looks like (A large box with seven compartments and daily labels), it is very difficult to open. There is only the tiniest sliver of plastic to push up to open one of the compartments, and it locks very tightly. I have full dexterity and I often resort to opening it with my teeth. I would expect that kind of clasp on something that will go in a backpack, not something for around the house. If you want something 'child-proof' then this is good, but if it's just for personal use then find something easier to open.
I always have heartburn after a spicy meal.  Unfortunately, I lived in Mexico for a number of years, and it caught up to me.  I have ulcers, and terrible about taking care of them.  Nonetheless, Pepcid AC gets me through the meal & through the night.  No waking up with caffeine burns & or too much hot sauce burns.  I like what I drink & I like what I eat & as unhealthy as that may be at times, Pepcid AC is there for me....and she doesn't judge me either ;)  GOOD BUY!
I'm taking NSAID therapy for my arthritis and was required to take medication to protect my stomach. Initially I tried Nexium which unfortunately I had uncomfortable side effects while taking it. So I spoke to my pharmacist who had a complete list of all the various prescriptions I as an older person have to take, she recommended Pepcid AC 20 mg saying it would have the fewest interactions with the other medicines I was taking. I went online to find the most reasonable price as usual ended up on Amazon and so far so good...my tummy is fine, no heartburn and no side effects. While I have no way of knowing if this would be true for other people I know it was a real Godsend for me. The price is right, the delivery was really quick and Pepcid AC has worked just great.
I've recently put myself on a strict low carb plan for a few weeks and after several days, I couldn't figure out why the weight wasn't coming off. Thanks to these easy to use strips, I was able to verify that I wasn't in ketosis yet. Once I was able to determine where the hidden carbs were coming from, VIOLA -- strip finally changed color! I love the convenience of these -- just place the strip in your urine stream for 1 second and wait 60 seconds -- no pee cup!Some of the other reviewers noted that these "expire" quickly. I've only used this for a week so I have no idea whether they'll hold up for 3 months. Since these appear to be sensitive to exposure, I think they should've shipped the bottle with a sealed foil at the top. Who knows how long this particular bottle I was shipped has been around since it doesn't have a seal...
I found this product through the Amazon subscribe and save program. It is now the only razor that my husband will use. His skin is very sensitive, so most razors cause nicks, cuts, scrapes and rashes. He has none of these problems using this razor. On occasion he will nick himself, but that is usually because he's in a hurry! I will continue to buy this razor for as long as Amazon has it at such a good price. They are much more expensive at my local stores.
I've tried every razor on the market (for reasons even I can't explain) and have come to the conclusion that this razor is &#34;the best&#34; for the following reasons:1. The shave is clean and long-lasting2. The chance for nicks is much less than most3. The razor head is wide, which provides stability and reduces shaving time4. The price is far less than the insanely-priced Gillette Fusion, which in my experience has some -- but not enough - benefits to justify its lofty cost.5. These razors can be purchased at very low prices not just a Amazon but at CVS and no doubt other retailers using a coupon or watching for a discount.6. Note: This razor has a better feel than the cartridge version, which is heavier and unbalanced.In short, Schick finally got it right, eliminating the need to line Gillette's pockets.
These razors work great on my scalp.  I use them about three or four times before tossing them, but I use them on my head and my beard since my hair on the top of my head is getting thinner by the day.  They offer the closest shave I've had on the top of my noggin since I've been shaving my noggin(about two years).  My only complaint is that my neck is rather sensitive, and this particular razor doesn't handle my neck so well.  So, I'd recommend it more for shaving your head than your beard if you're a tender, rugged man like myself, heh, heh.In short, it's a pretty good razor that definitely has my vote when considering my scalp.  For my beard, I'm still on the lookout for a better blade.
Since I don't eat powerbars to achieve the advantages of being energized before a workout, I chose them purely as a snack.  Unlike the usual powerbar hardened feel, this is unique soft chew, and it looks like a drinkable smoothie.Fruit Smoothie Energize has a strong berry aroma upon opening the package.  The bar is with 210 calories and 30 calories from Fat.  It is filled with 17...count 'em...17 vitamins and minerals.  The product claims no artificial flavors, colors or preservatives.I like the taste for a quick pick me up...Now I am energized for the day, or maybe for just for the ride home from work.....Rizzo
Received this powerbar and tried it along with my preteen daughter. After her first bite she exclaimed that it tasted like her vitamins. I had to agree with her that it actually did. It also has a funny after taste which if you can stand might make this a good an nutritious meal. I did give my husband a bit to try and he seemed to enjoy it. It does seem to have enough vitamins but has a little too much sodium for my taste. I would have loved to give it a 5 star rating but a 3 will have to suffice.
I've always had a bit of an issue with PowerBars:  they look like someone has poured a chewed granola bar into a packet and sealed it up.  If the unopened bar even gets slightly warm, it warps all out of shape.  So when you open the pack, you get this weirdly shaped bar of stuff.  Even so, this new Fruit Smoothie bar, while not overly attractive looking, tastes pretty much like a fruit smoothie surprisingly enough.  PowerBar did a good job of hiding that usual "protein bar" taste with these.  The texture is a little strange and the calories are a little high, but if you can get over the weird sensation your tongue will get and use the bar as a meal replacement, then these bars a pretty dang good.
I received a free sample power bar through the Vine Program and looked forward to trying it; when it arrived I was babysitting two preteens, so we each had a portion and all of us agreed -- yuk! I'm giving this item 2 stars because the flavor was fine; though one child said it tasted "like vitamins", I think he meant the good fruit-tasting vitamins. The problem with this bar is the texture -- it is VERY gummy, and even stretched a bit when we cut it into portions. As one chews, it becomes rubbery; in the interest of this review I had to force myself to finish my one-third portion because it was so unpleasant. If you're prepared for the texture you may enjoy the fine flavor, but otherwise I'd suggest you steer clear of this energy bar.
Why anyone would subject themselves to consuming this horrid concoction unless they are close to death is beyond me.  This is the most foul tasting power bar I have ever had the misfortune to consume.  It's rather gooey in texture and bitterly sweet with an overpowering, intense, awful fruit flavoring.  It's loaded with sugar and calories, which is what a power bar typically consists of, but I've had others that at least didn't leave your taste buds damaged for the rest of the day.  Unless you are absolutely desperate for some carbs, avoid this one at all cost.
Strawberry is definately there. There's definately a ton of vitamin flavor in here also. The first taste, well, chalk comes to mind. Then bitter. Then sweet. Then strawberry. A little bit of dairy. Then, well I really needed to clear my mouth with something else.Smoothie flavor.... not a chance. It's stiff, sticky, chewy, and sickeningly sweet.How does it compare to those nasty marzipan bitter vitaminie energy bars? Well this one is just vaguely tolerable compared to those.Sorry, I'm afraid I'd rather go hungry.
I selected this product for my 18 year old daughter to try. She's always on the go running from work to dance to class or to have fun. She burns a ton of calories and was interested in an energy bar with nutritional value.This bar was disappointing. The texture was grainy and the taste wasn't appealing. She ate it with a glass of milk and said that the combination left a feeling that there was a coating in the back of her throat. She did not care for the flavor of the bar and was unable to finish the entire thing -- not because she felt full, but because it just didn't meet expectations as far as taste, texture and satisfaction. Would not buy.
I've been a fan of PowerBar since 1996 when I was pregnant with my oldest child. I used the bars as snacks when I had to be at the University for college classes all day.  I came to know "the PowerBar aftertaste".  I used the bars again as nutritional supplements during two subsequent pregnancies.  Some slight differences but still that aftertaste.I am happy to report that the PowerBar Energize Berry Blast Fruit Smoothie bar has no aftertaste. It isn't too sweet. It isn't gritty.  It's actually very good.It's nice to see how PowerBar has grown up.  The nutritional values have increased, the taste is better. I would actually consider using this as a  meal replacement or healthy snack a few times a week.
The PowerBar Fruit smoothie is an all natural energy bar that tastes surprisingly good.  I wasn't expecting much in the "taste" department, so that was a pleasant surprise. So what does it taste like?  Well, as far as texture... it's very chewy like Starburst candy or Airheads but also has some crunchiness to it like in a chewy Granola bar. It's sort of a cross between those two things. And it tastes kind of like "fruit loops" cereal :)So because it's packed with vitamins, protein, yada yada yada, and actually tastes good...  I can't complain.  I'd gladly eat another one as a snack. I wish they'd sent me a whole box to review and not just one sample. Oh well.
These aren't terrible.  I know, hardly a ringing endorsement, but I was a bit divided about the things.  They're not terrible.  But they're not particularly good either.  Now, PowerBars have their own unique flavor to start with, and I can deal with that.  I even buy them when I travel and need something to much on the flight.  But this flavor was a bit odd.  Okay, I know what it made me think of - those rubber taffee things we used to eat as kid, the long wide sticks - that's what they taste like.  Kind of a fake fruit flavor.  Again, not terrible, but would I buy it again?  No.  Try it if you're curious, but buy one - not a pack.
I think most energy bars taste pretty bad, but this one actually has a pleasant fruit flavor, and a consistency like a thick fruit rollup.  With 42g of carbs this bar should really get you going.  I use Clif Builders protein bars as a meal replacement, and like them a lot.  I don't think this particular bar would work as a meal replacement, but instead as a supplement before a workout or other physical activity.If you already eat Power Bars, but haven't tried this specific flavor, you should give it a shot.  If you aren't really into energy bars, and are thinking of trying one, I think this is one that has decent enough flavor that it won't turn you off.
I like the taste of this product. It's sweet, fruity, chewy and creamy. Unlike many energy bars, it wasn't difficult to eat. Buyers should be aware that each bar has 24g of sugar(5.7 teaspoons)and 210 calories.  If you have food allergies you should know the bars contain nuts(almonds, peanuts) and soy, and it states that it is "made on equipment that processes wheat".  The bars also contain from 20% - 100% of the RDA of many vitamins and minerals, something to think about if you take vitamin/mineral supplements. I think I would eat them occasionally for a quick energy boost.
Well, this bar tastes decent and has lots of nutrients added, but I found it more sugary than I'd like.  I really prefer more natural bars... Luna & Odwalla have healthier bars and I personally like extra-healthy ones like Raw Revolution - getting energy from raw whole foods is better than getting it from a sugar burst.  So this PowerBar is fine if you don't mind getting the high amount of sugar-based carbs.  Anyone sensitive to dairy should be aware this has a small amount of milk component in it.  I give this 3 stars for being a bit better than average but not up to par with what I personally look for in an energy/nutrition bar.
As someone who has eaten his fair share of Powerbars, I found this to be my least favorite of all.  The first bite tasted like Flintstones chewable vitamins from my childhood.  As I ate more, the Fliststone's taste lessened a bit, enough for me to finish the bar.It tastes like a raspberry-blueberry mix might taste.  It definetly does not tast like strawberry, which is the first-listed berry on the ingredients list.  To its credit, only raspberries and blueberries are pictured on the wrapper.This product is very soft.  The softness makes it feel like it melted, but that is not the case because it was room temperature.  It is very chewy and is easily mishapen because it is so soft.  The texture and grittiness reminds me of Airheads candy, but much, much softer.Overall, I probably would not purchase this product in the store now that I have tasted it.  I would like to try the other flavors though.
This product tastes great at first but after chewing for a few moments it becomes quite boring especially the part that sticks to all of your mouth.  The flavor was just super; howevere, most of the other features caused the taste to get on your nerves.  Additionally, I noticed no power associated with the bar.  Bottom line for me is I would not buy the bar unless I was in a serious need for power or chewy chewy chewy...  Put another way, I am glad I only tried one of these.  Maybe different flavors would make it better but that is speculative.
The Berry Blast Fruit Smoothie PowerBar provides all the energy sustaining vitamins and minerals which one might expect from an energy bar, and it has a satisfying, mildly fruity flavor without being too sweet.This 210 calorie bar will carry you through any rigorous workout whether you're exercising at the gym, or you're landscaping out in yard, this power bar is a tasty way to keep from suffering the dizzying effects of nutrient deficiency while performing demanding tasks.An excellent pick-me-up, Berry Blast Fruit Smoothie is a delicious way to keep going!
I'm an energy and health bar fan who prefers granola and Kashi bars rather than "sweet" and "fruity" yet this product surprised me with its flavor plus. If you like a "sweet" yet healthy snack or meal replacement you might consider this product. It does not have a strong overpowering fruit flavor but it does have a blast of berry taste. The consistancy is like taffy and it is best when "pulled" apart than just biting into it as it will stick to your teeth a bit. The carbs and sugar grams are a little higher than I would like and the fiber a bit non-existant but overall the vitamins and minerals are quite sufficient even though it does not contain any Vitamin A and very low potassium with only 35mg. The calories are 210 a bar which is average for a power bar and slightly less than a candy bar. Great for a quick breakfast on the run or a snack in between.
My daughter and I each took a bite of this bar -- and one bite was enough.  With the consistency of taffy, this bar has got 24 grams of sugar.  It's like taking a heaping tablespoon of sugar along with your vitamins.  Ugh.Note for celiacs:  Not a gluten-free food.  Although the ingredients list no wheat or gluten, it is processed on equipment that also processes wheat. Also contains nuts, milk, and soy.  And sugar. Lots and lots of sugar.
If you've never had one of these, do yourself a favor and try one before you commit to an entire box. They're sweet, sticky, and really chewy, and they'll do a great job of giving you energy and killing your appetite. That may actually be a good thing, depending on the context.I don't eat these much lately, but there was a time when I was very busy at work, and I didn't want to take a half-hour for lunch and pay $7.00, and I didn't bring my lunch, but I had a box of these and it took only one to get me to totally forget about food for several hours. Power indeed.
This is a very delicious bar. It doesn't have that weird, dusty taste that so many nutrition bars have, it's chewy and, to coin a phrase, it's satisfying.If I had to fault it at all, I would say that its sweetness is quite intense. That's an easy fix, though: Don't eat it all at once. Take your time and nibble at it over a 30-minute period.It's high in carbs but not in calories so it's a good choice of nutrition right before a hard work task or exercise routine. It's crammed with vitamins, too, more than most bars.As a martial arts teacher and weight trainer, I highly recommend this one.
These power bars in that mixed berry blast flavor are tasty and delicious! True, I have to take a few minutes to chew them--they're not something I can eat very quickly, they're too chewy for that. Most importantly, but they are very  helpful to me when I exercise. For example, they are excellent for a power boost shortly before I exercise; and they help me replenish the salt I lose when I perspire both during and shortly after exercising.Some will say that these bars really give you protein while others maintain that these bars don't have enough protein. They do have 6 grams of protein per bar so I guess it becomes an individual decision when it comes to just how much protein you want; you could have two bars before a workout or running if extra protein is what you want.Overall, these bars are great. I love them! They are excellent for athletes and anyone serious about working out, but of course they can be enjoyed as a snack if you wish.
I was pleasantly surprised by the tangy fruit flavor of these Berry Blast PowerBars. Obviously, you won't get the cool-down effect of an icy fruit smoothie, but the lighter flavor, as compared to chocolate and other dessert-inspired varieties, is perfect for summer. Plus, with 17 vitamins and minerals, it appears to be a healthy snack.It's marketed as an "Energize" bar, but don't expect any significant pick-me-up effect. You'll get more of a boost from a mug of caffeinated coffee. Plus, 24 grams of sugar per bar might scare some away. But, if you're looking for a tasty snack to tie you over till your next meal, I think it's a pretty good choice.
First immediate impression: really sweet and artificial tasting. Though it kind of tastes like fruit punch in my opinion, it's kind of a shocking type of taste for a product like this. Definitely a bit like candy as reviewers have mentioned.Apart for the energy, it did keep me going for a game of basketball I had about an hour after eating the bar. Nutrition facts aren't that great compared to completing products, however. And like other products from this manufacturer, they're still quite expensive per single bar.
I've never been too fond of PowerBar in general, but decided to give this Fruit Smoothie Berry Blast flavor a try regardless.  The end result is a flavor that isn't too bad (compared to the Chocolate flavored Powerbar, which certainly doesn't taste like chocolate to me at all), and better yet, doesn't make you gag as soon as it touches your tongue.  It's flavor doesn't entirely taste like a berry flavored fruit smoothie, but the fruity taste of the bar is strangely satisfying however.  All in all, in terms of energy, nutrition, or protein bars, you can certainly do worse than what you get here with the PowerBar Fruit Smoothie Berry Blast flavor, and if you're an energy bar fanatic looking for something new, this is definitely worth a try at the very least.
I am an endurance athlete who does long distance events. Powerbars are a staple of my pre and post-workout fueling regime. They are calorie dense (250 per bar) and combine protein and carbs (40 g. carbs, 8g protein) which the current research says is most optimal for performance. You are feel "full" during your training without discomfort or cramps. Plus, I just like the way they taste, but they all taste similar. Avoid the berry varieties and fruit flavors:)  The downside of the bars is that they are not for "on the run"--they are rather chewy and need to be well digested. They also get hard in the cold, so do not bring with you on runs in the winter:)Dieters, beware: these bars are not for weightloss, but performance. 250 calories is about the equivalent amount of calories in a donut, so make sure you're working out, too:)
POWERBAR ENERGIZE BERRY BLAST FRUIT SMOOTHIE is extremely sweet, fruity, and tangy.  The nutritional contents may appeal to those interested in adding a little healthy snack in between meals.  And for those who need a push to their day, the sugar contents may provide the energy for those on the go and the essential vitamins and minerals.  Indeed, the taste and chew is somewhat reminiscent of taffy candy similar to a Starburst or fruit roll-up.  However, after gobbling an entire bar, it may leave you wanting to grab something to drink to wash it down.Overall, it is a nice and refreshing treat.
I was disappointed in this bar.  It seemed at first like it would be a good item.  It smelled really good, and I liked the texture.  Kind of reminded me of Airhead candy.Now the fruit taste is pretty good actually.  And it is easy to chew so no complaints there.  But other than that, I have nothing but complaints about the bar.  I mean come on, ultimately what's the most important thing the consumer will care about.  The taste.  And that is a big F on the old report card.The bar is not smooth at all.  It has a very fruity taste which is good.  But soon it is replaced by a gritty, grainy taste that overpowers any tastiness of the bar.  Overall, it comes across as kind of nasty.  I would never spend money on this.  Come on guys.  You can do better..
Today I tried thePowerBar Fruit Smoothie, Berry Blast (Pack of 12). I had flashbacks to my college days where I supplemented my diet and exercise regimen with the peanut butter or chocolate PowerBars. Mostly I didn't always have time to eat and these were easy to carry in the backpack and were better than vending machine fare.This still has the familiar chewy texture, but now with hints of berries. At first I thought I noticed a slight tropical punch flavor, but then it was really more of a cross between a strawberry toaster pastry or candy chew...but in a good way. Not overpoweringly sweet and the right balance of flavors. Actually, quite tasty.If you have tried and liked the texture of the PowerBar, this is a worthwhile flavor to consider.
(I'd actually give it two and a half stars if I could) I'm always up for trying a new protein/energy bar, so I have a lot of experience with them. PowerBar regular is not the top of my list, but I don't dislike them. So I thought this would be interesting."Interesting" is a good word. Nutritionally it seems pretty sound (though not the best) 10 vitamins plus amino acids. 210 calories, 24g carbs, 6g protein. Flavor-wise it's ok. It's fruity and a bit tart. This makes sense since it has strawberries and cranberries in it as well as four fruit juices. The consistency was a bit on the grainy side.Think: Laffy Taffy or Airheads taffy (+ vitamins and protein) dropped in the sand.
. . . what this is . . . a good tasting, portable/storable shot of 210 calories fortified with a variety of minerals and vitamins (substantial vits B, C, E, as well as a wide list of minerals).Filling.  A taffy-like consistency with a grittiness akin to ground up berry seeds (whether authentic or just for effect, I do not know). Pleasant berry-like flavor.  Very low fat (no trans-fats), low sodium. 24 grams of sugar.I am not a big fan of energy bars and their often medicine-like taste.  I like this one.  Seems to be a good choice for lunch boxes, trunk of the car, backpacks or emergency kits.
I really enjoyed this bar. It was a sweet and fruity treat that I enjoyed.  The texture was a little gritty but not bad at all.  Infact, I barely noticed it.  The bar itself was soft which is nice when you are tired after a workout.  I could see that this bar would harden if I kept it in the cooler.The only downside was that I did not feel any extra amount of energy.  I basically felt as replenished as I do with any bar I eat.  I was satisfied with this and a bottle of water.This was definitely a flavorful treat that I would reccomend to anyone.
I bought these a few days ago at CVS drugstore, and though I really do like them I am unhappy with how they slide down in my shoes. When they slide down a half inch in my shoes then I'm not getting the arch support I need and my feet then hurt (a lot). I even tried to keep them in place with strong 2 inch wide double stick tape, and still have the problem as the tape won't stick to the gel insoles. I then tried using the tape to tape the top of the insole to the shoe, but then I feel the tape against my foot, and, when the insole slides down a little anyway then there is a ridge of tape that is definately uncomfortable on my feet. I hope I can find some way to keep them in place; otherwise I probably won't keep using them.Also, I don't think the arch support is very 'supportive': it's barely there.
These do cushion your feet, but are very HEAVY.  They made my running shoes noticably more heavy.  I went to a local running store and purchased running-specific inserts.  These running-specific inserts allow me to run marathons much more comfortably.  I believe the weight of the Dr Scholls would slow down my running time and add to muscle fatigue.  You get what you pay for -- the running-specific inserts were $24.I now use the Dr Scholls at my job where I work long shifts (often standing).  The Dr Scholls do help eliminate fatigue on the job.
Smells like the barber shop from when I was a kid. A little goes a long way- bottle will last me a year!  Shipping is limited- can't ship to an APO/DPO or FPO.  Hard scent to describe. It will heal up the nicks.  Not sure how it works after shaving with cartridge razor since I'm old school and use the double edge safety razor- this stuff does exactly what it's suppose to- cools the skin after the shave to calm the razor burn.  Heal the nicks and moisturize though this does have some level of alcohol so it's not like the old formula.
I used to see Clubman at the drugstore (in glass bottles) but at the time I was an Old Spice and Aramis guy. Bought a bottle of this on a lark to get an order up over the $35 mark and tried it the next weekend (weekends are when I'm alone and if it bombs I don't have to suffer all day with it).After the alcohol flashed off and the essence warmed on my skin the most pleasant aroma filled the room, but not overpowering. And you won't smell like the boys in gym class with their Bod and Axe.
I just rediscovered Pinaud Clubman, and was instantly transported back to the barber's of my youth.Love the fresh, clean, powdery scent.  Wish it came in an EDT or EDC - but according to Pinaud (I wrote them to ask) it doesn't.Cannot believe such a great scent exists at this price.If you are on the fence, just roll the dice - the beauty of Pinaud's Clubman is that even if you are in the &lt;1% of people it doesn't call to, you'll only be out a couple of bucks.  You can give it away if you don't like it (but you won't, because you'll probably like it).
So, I discovered that the scent of the Clubman after shave is noticeably different and less pleasant when the bottle has been sitting for a while, so make sure to shake it before each use.  This may account for some people who said they didn't like it.I recently saw the razor commercial by the Pawn Stars guy and decided to try an old-school safety razor, not the one they were selling on TV but a quality one off Amazon.  Anyway, I decided while I'm going old-school I might as well get some old-school after shave and I doubt you could get more old-school than a brand that has been around for over 200 years.I definitely like it, but the real judge of whether this is any good is the lady in your life.  My wife said I smelled good, so for me it's a winner.
Recently started wet shaving and wanted something classic to follow the shaving process with. I'm 44 and this reminds me of the barber shop I got my haircuts back in the early 70's. Definitely a tried and true scent. The alcohol works well with my face after the shave. Have also gotten my 70 year old father back on the double edge and sent this to him. This, combined with the '66 super speed I gave him, brings back many memories for him. Classic with a little sting, great end to a shave.
I have not used after shave in 20 years, so I am a born again virgin on this product type.The Clubman After Shave is pleasant in smell, but I must watch how much I use - can be overbearing if you are not careful.  Reminds me of my grandpa, when we went visiting, to me, thats a good thing.  Smells nice, rolls on easy.I do notice that my post shave routine is soothed by using aftershave to ease the nicks and such.  I have recently switched over to Double Edge safety razor on the toss away multiple head shavers.  The DE Safety razors are very sharp, and nicks now occur, were they were seldom on the duller toss aways.  So a good after shaved seemed a worthy product to try, and it works.  I guess granpa was pretty smart after all.Why 4 stars, not 5 - I only 5 for truly outstanding products.  This is very good, and recommended.
Just A Quick Note:I Really Like This Clubman Aftershave.The Scent is really good and 'CLASSY' while not overpowering yet it isn't completely gone after say 20 mins outside.So I use it in the evenings or when I take a girlfriend out to dinner.For my main or Daytime after shave I Use/Prefer Clubman Special Reserve but that is a Strong/Overpowering scent which may not always be appropriate in all situations tho it will stay with you all day long.Now the regular scent which we are talking about here is more balanced and better used in those touchy 'Social Situations!' as I like to use this together with a dash of Eau De Quinine hair tonic if I need a dash of something just a bit stronger and have been complimented by ladies many times.So for those delicate situations where you need a good but moderate After Shave then this is the one.Nuff Said.Indiana ED
My Grandfather was a Barber so I might be a tad biased. I do really love this stuff and have not received a negative comment from anyone regarding the aroma, in fact, quite the contrary. Even though this is made by a company that's been here for over two-hundred years, it doesn't scream &#34;Old Man&#34; after shave. I've even had young guys ask what I'm wearing because that liked it and were interested in purchasing it for themselves. Even my WIFE really likes it and she's really picky about what she likes me wearing.That just confirmed to me that I was on to a good thing....THANKS CLUBMAN!
This stuff is really, really nice. It smells better than some of the more expensive colognes I own although it does not last very long. The fragrance is strong when you put it on but quickly fades (i've found others can smell it within around 30 minutes of putting it on). This is the only fragrance that I consistently receive compliments on and that has never happened with any other cologne/fragrance in my life. This stuff smells EXACTLY like my barber shop and smells insanely manly, fresh, sharp, clean...you know the deal. This stuff is a steal for what I paid (6 dollars and 50 cents) and I feel like a million bucks when I put it on. Worth every cent
Nostalgia has driven me to purchase quite a few of the Clubman products. Aside from the pinaud talc, nothing brings back memories of spending afternoons in the barbershop with my grandfather like this aftershave.It's fresh, clean, and subtle enough to use for any occasion. As far as scent...think Brut with baby powder. This is an alcohol based aftershave, so if it's a moisturizing A/S that you're looking for, this probably isn't it. However, I've never had a problem with it drying me out.
Just for fun I bought a sample of this from Garry's sample shop.  I was really surprised how much I liked it.  It does have alcohol in it, but it doesn't set your face on fire after a shave.  Just enough burn to wake you up.  It works well to stop any minor weepers you might have, and the scent is classic, old school barbershop.  Not overpowering, just nice.  My wife likes it as well.  For the price, give it a shot.  You will likely be surprised as well.
Lots of joke review on this, it seems...  This is an actual review.The product works fine as an aftershave if you like alcohol.  It's not overly 'hot' from the alcohol, and does a decent job of soothing after a shave.The smell, however, is very strange.  Actually, it smells a lot like geraniums, that usually-red flower, but they (like the aftershave) don't smell flowery at all.  Instead, it's more like a cleaning product or an herbal/natural bug repellant.  Nobody would smell this and think of cologne or aftershave; it's not even in that ballpark.  It's not an *unpleasant* smell, but I'm left asking myself why I'd want to smell like this on purpose.
Of course, I am an old man, so this is how I am supposed to smell.  The crisp, clean burn of application is followed by a whiff of olfactory Heaven.  Think Barber Shops, where working men wait for a trim.Disclaimer:  If you have ever thought of yourself as a &#34;metro-sexual&#34; then this is not the aftershave for you.  If you are into Sky-diving, scuba, mountain climbing, hunting, fishing, rappelling, and sword fighting, then splash away!
When I use this lotion daily, I am taken back to the smell of my barber shop fifty years ago. The lotion smells wonderful, not bothering my odor sensitive wife, who also finds it to be pleasant. It is very soothing after a shave. The mouth of the bottle has a nice stopper that allows easily shaking a good amount into the hand, with out over pouring and wasting. The price of the small 4 oz bottles of other brands in the stores has become outrageous and this lotion seems to be a good buy in a volume that should last a good while. I believe this will be my lotion from now on.
I would buy it again. I like the masculine smell a lot and it is like a cologne/parfume, it stays with you for a long time and you can sense it all the time. It is really very pleasurable!$5 is a grat price for this. You get a plastic bottle, but who cares (surely a glass one would be more stylish)! I have to point out that this is a odor for mature men, like 25 and older. Do not hesitate on buying it, because it is cheap and smells great.
When a product has been around since the days of Charles Darwin and Abraham Lincoln, you know there has to be something to it. This fine barber shop after shave has been used since Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday, soldiers in the Civil War throughout history up to the Titanic to the Queen Mary to today.It's longevity is its validity. It smells great (Like a barber shop) and it cools and heals razor burn and makes your skin smooth. It will wake you up in the morning and smells much better than today's after shave's and cologne's.Try it and see why it has stood the test of time.
Wow. This stuff is strong. You can really feel the burn. I use this at night before bed and in the mornings, the scent lingers but is mostly gone (thankfully). I would never want to wear this right before work since some people may complain. When I apply it on my upper lip area, I have to be in front of a fan or moving around. A full whiff of this will take your breath away. The smell is pretty nice but I can't get it out of my head that it kind of smells like a mix of shaving cream and sun tan lotion. Still manly though. The bottle is plastic so you won't shatter it with a little drop. Since it's a liquid I end up wasting a lot that just falls out of my hands and whatnot. This seems to not really be a big issue though. I seem to be going through it at an acceptable rate in my opinion. My estimate would be a bottle every 2 months.
I used this aftershave for the first time last night. There is alcohol, so you get a nice burn. The smell is ok, very old-school, but it lingers for an exceptionally long period of time. I shaved 3 hours before bed and it smelled as if I had just used the stuff when I put my head on the pillow. My wife made a comment also about how potent the smell was. When I woke up in the morning I could still smell the scent ever so slightly. It is now 1pm in the afternoon the next day and even with several hand washes today, my hand still smells like this aftershave. So, you have been warned.
Clubman is definitely a throwback to the past however, this after shave is still relevant today. After going through my DE shabe ritual,  I splashed some on and was sent back in time to a Real Barber shop. You know the type, four red chairs, black and white tv set on a stand in the corner, two old timers playing checkers. The magazine selection was a mix of Guns and Ammo or Outdoor Life no GQ or Mens Health.  No bass pumping, no overly expensive shampoo's or metrosexual products. Just a Barber shop, nothing fancy, but one of the best places to be on a Saturday morning.This after shave is a time tested winner. I have worn many colognes in the past but nothing I have compares to Clubman. My wife loves it so, that seals the deal in my book. Buy a bottle or two and enjoy!
What's not to like about Pinaud? Back in the day, my barber used to splash this stuff on me after every haircut and it always seemed to last the whole day without being overpowering. I thought this might be some cheap imitation, but nope --- it's the real stuff and I like it. They won't get a lot of money out of me on restocking though, because like the old slogan for another favorite of mine, &#34; A drop makes quite a splash&#34; and 12 ounces should last quite a while.
Feels great after I splash this on after a shave. Makes my skin feel clean and refreshed and my razor burn on my throat has diminished greatly after using this product. The slight burn after a really close shave is really invigorating too. I even splash some on after a shower the next day or day after that. It just feels good and primes my skin for the next shave I think. Smell is powerful at first but it fades at just the right rate and leaves me smelling good and not overpowering. I would definitely recommend this product to any of my friends.
I am mid 30's and just got into wet shaving. I read reviews about this and knew what I was getting into. I thought this stuff would smell more old man'ish than it does. It actually smells pretty great. The smell does stick around for a while. I can smell this stuff on my hands AFTER a couple of washes. So if you want something that dies down quick this may not be the best thing for you. Since I love the smell I just stopped wearing cologne and I just rock out with this instead.
This is the scent I've been looking for!  It does not even come close to the boyish commercial perfumes they call mens aftershave today. Now many on here claim this stuff burn like lava. Nonsense! Absolutely false. The first time I splashed this on my face the thought that came to mind was I possibly just stuck my face into a hornets nest! Or maybe I had touched a live electrical wire to my face!  It leaves the skin tight and firm and the smell is not overpowering. The wife loves it too! I'll be using this forever.
I just bought a Merkur 180 safety razor...best shave of my 42 years of life.  Now I wanted some aftershave.  Well, this stuff had so many 5 star reviews but with such a small price, I didn't know what to expect.  Surely if it is that cheap it must be horrible.  Wrong! Wrong!  Wow...this stuff is nice.  It really is old school, my wife and kids love it and I can't believe how inexpensive it is.  I really wanted Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood but that's $40 and I'm not spending that...how happy I am I took the chance on this!
I love this stuff. I grew up in the 60's/70's going to the barber with my Dad. I got a haircut in the booster seat and he got a haircut and straight razor shave. The barber always ended his shave with a huge dose of Pinaud Clubman from the industrial size bottle on the counter. I bought this for the nostalgia and ended up using it after every shave. I love the way it feels and smells. My wife really likes it too. My oldest son started wet shaving using mystuff and loves this stuff. He actually started wet shaving because of Clubman. I guess some things just never go out of style. His frat at college is now getting into wet shaving and Clubmam is theirfavorite aftershave.Maybe I'll try the straight razor next?
This is the perfect after shave. It has a classic,clean, masculine scent that lingers without being over powering. It's also very affordable but it beats any other aftershave on the market at any price. If you are only going to use one aftershave for the rest of your life, this is the one you want. If you like having a variety of after shaves, you definitely want this one in your arsenal. It has a strangely familiar yet unique quality to it that is hard to explain but you know it when you try it because it gets the job done in every aspect you would hope for in an after shave.
I remember my old barber, I was too young for  the shave, but remember haircut,  the powder and the tonic, The brush on back of the neck,The fresh haircut scent.This is it!The only after shave / cologne you really need, without spending 60- 80 - 100? Bucks.Simple.Sure, Chanel for men is great,But clubman pinaud brings back those long past days of barbershops.Falling asleep with the snip snip snipping sound of scissors and the tickle behind the ear from the buzzing of the shears.The brush powder on the neck, a splash.Boy or man, that fresh haircut and a shave feeling is reborn.No worries if you don't have to shave, a light splash and people will think you did.
Bottle though as usual is plastic (I have a proraso and old spice both come in good packaging) this stuff smells great and smell is long lasting. Feels very cool after applying this and I must admit, this is something which I don't mind replenishing after I finish this. There are very few aftershaves which I really prefer to repeat, this being one of them. The fragrance is one of the highlights. Though I would expect it be in a better packaging which will only add to its value.Therefore one star is reduced from 5 only because of packaging. Rest of the stars go for the fragrance and the cool refreshing feeling it gives after a baby smooth shave. This is something I would recommend one should try atleast once.
In a world of advertisements that act like a body spray will get a socially challenged male to be ravaged by supermodels, this fragrance is very refreshing. Like so many reviews will say, the fragrance is &#34;old school&#34; and reminds you of a barbershop. I'm sure the fragrance isn't for everyone, but I do enjoy the time tested classiness of the stuff. I am in my early thirties and married so I don't worry about the body sprays too much. Just give me this old school, subtle fragrance to get me through the day.
I think fragrance is a personal thing: you either like them or you dislike them, there isn't a lot of middle ground. I personally love the classic Clubman fragrance. It reminds me of the barbershop my dad took me to when I was a kid. Reminds me of him, too. For the price, you can afford to give this a try sometime. Even if you dislike it, it's not like tossing it out would cost you a ton of money. But if you've ever had a haircut in a real barbershop, chance are you are already familiar with Clubman.
This a great money and for the price it's even more amazing. I don't find the smell to be over powering, however, that can differ from person to person. The smell is a pleasant one, so it's not bad if it is anyway. Saves a day you don't have wear cologne. If you didn't have such a smooth shave, you will feel a sting. After applying the aftershave I always apply cold water to close my pores, and that will leave my face feeling tight and uncomfortable. If you find yourself having the same problem, I would recommend you apply some sort of face toner afterwards. It leaves my face cleaner and most, if not all, the tightness goes away. Other than that, this product is great and I will purchase this again.
Tried this when I was curious about the old school barbershop colognes. First impression is &#34;Man this stuff is powerful&#34;. I would call it a cologne first aftershave second. It hits strong but the smell does mellow and gets powdery. Most aftershave splashes i use enough to wet the palm and rub into the face. This one i put two drops then wet my palm with witchhazel. It has an oily feel that leaves your face moisturized and drys clean and smooth.The smell definitely reminds me of Brut's time ten when first applied, but when it mellows it leave a nice fresh powdery scent with a hint of Brut.
So, I tried it the first time this morning and there was no hurtful stinging on my tender skin, I found that it would be okay for me as the sting was almost missing.  Along with the missing sting is the missing after shave smell.  I didn't detect any odor at all and I had all my nose hairs clipped.  The essences are from France and &#34;made in the USA&#34; is on the plastic bottle.But, it is cheap insofar as cost goes.Would make a nice Xmas gift for the man in your life but he might try to re-gift it.Thank God it doesn't smell like BRUT.  A kid in the neighborhood had been led astray by using Brut and I could smell his coming two blocks away.I have on order the Bay Rum rendition so I might bore you all again!
Great scent that has staying power. It's a grown man's scent. It's not a scent you'd use trolling for hotties; rather a scent that says, "I'm an adult who is serious about my daily grooming routine."Here's how to work it. Finish your shave with a cold water rinse (and for God's sake use a brush and a quality shave soap! Proraso and Colonel Conk make wonderful, very affordable soaps.) While your face is a bit wet, put 2 shakes of the lotion in the palm of your hand and gently apply to face and neck. If you get a bracing sting, it means you over-cooked your shave. Lighten up on the pressure next time. You'll find the lotion dries down nicely leaving your face toned and smooth...and smelling like a new haircut in the North Bronx back in 1955. Great product.
My first experience with Pinaud was in the barber shop, when my barber used Pinaud talcum powder after cutting my hair.  I thought it was a good product, which convinced me to buy this aftershave.Scent- It does contain alcohol, but it didn't make the scent too strong.  The scent can last a couple hours after application, but if that is not to your liking, you can apply a little water to rinse away the excess.Effect- My face feels smoother and cleaner after I apply a splash of this aftershave.  It cleans out my pores before I apply some cold water to close them up.I am very satisfied with this product, and I will look into more Pinaud products because of it.
This is the quintessential 'man' scent. Barbershops, old vets, razor blades and Clubman. I bought the bottle locally and it isn't at all hard to find.It has a pleasant fragrance with touches of vanilla and musk. It is alcohol-based, and is a brisk follow-up after shaving and giving your face a cold water rinse. It can be pretty powerful when first applied but backs off quickly. I find that a trace of the scent lingers into the evening (which is fine with me as I don't wear cologne). I am not a fan of colognes or bottled smells but I love this product.
It smells great and the product can be seen in many barber shops. I've been using it for my customers after all straight razor shaves, but I think I'm going to switch it up for the my next after shave purchase. I suspect this product has a high level of alcohol which is great for killing bacteria, but the sting irritates some of the customers. Some of the other barbers I work with have been using other high end products which does a better job at soothing freshly shaved skin without the sting.
I normally get toothbrushes for nothing with a coupon at our local grocery store.  Been doing so for years.  However, the past couple of these have not lasted the whole 3 months.  Has anyone else noticed this?  I noticed that the bristles were falling out after only 2 weeks of use and that the bristles were curled outwards as if I'd used it for 5 months!  I do like this brush a lot, but I'll have to start looking for another brand if this continues.Honestly, $4 for a toothbrush?  REALLY?!!!  What happened to $.59?  Golly, whoever thought we'd see the day for $4 for a toothbrush!
I am not a picky person with toothbrushes, but the reason this toothpaste dissapointed me was that I expected it to be soft, as the name says. But its just like a regular toothbrush, not as soft as I wanted. I got a soft toothbrush of another brand and was satisfied with that. The good thing about this toothbrush is that its bristles do not wear out pretty fast, they remain intact for a long time. The size is good too, its just that I expected it to be softer.
#1 Works every time. I use it when I first feel the tingle along with L-Lysine tablets. 99% of the time a cold sore won't even appear if I get it early with this combo. Regarding packaging: This is the Best price anywhere is here on amazon. I used the pump for a while but realized how much product was being wasted once you get to the end and can't pump anymore out even tho there is more product inside. You can't cut it open to get the rest of the contents out either. I stick with this tube and can get every last drop of this as there isn't much in it to begin with and the price is still costly.
Go buy a bottle of benzyl alcohol and dilute it with 2 parts olive oil and a drop of lavender oil. The docosanol in abreva will help heal the sore once it ruptures, but has nothing to do with supressing the cold sore. To suppress the cold sore cotton swab on the oil&benzyl alcohol mixture as soon as you feel the tingling or get some Zilactin and stop letting Smith Klein get away with blatantly lying to you. You can get 4oz USP benzyl alcohol  for about $15. Keep the oil mixture in the fridge in a glass bottle and it should last you the rest of your life. Enjoy.
Common ailments have a lot of quackery solutions out there so one needs to be cautious.  Abreva simply does work wonders for cold sores, but only if you apply it when the initial tingling sensation is felt.  For this reason, I keep one tube at home and one in the car - yes, I keep it in my first aid kit that I have in the car.  That way, when I'm at work or out somewhere, I can just head to my car.  And I make sure to pack my home tube with me on vacations.  Been doing this for years, applying at the slightest sensation of a cold sore forming and never had a single one erupt.
Abreva works!!!!!!!! I used to get cold sores quite often, but since starting abreva, I haven't had one in an entire year. I kind of know what triggers them for me, so I try to anticipate the break out and begin applying the cream before hand. I dont wait for any tingly feelings to confirm that it is happening for sure, I just start abreva when a possible trigger happens. I probably use it sometimes when I dont need it, but I'd rather waste the medicine than have to deal with a break out. What triggers mine is when the first cold fronts come through and my lips get chapped, excessively stressful times, or when my lips get sun or wind burned. If any of those things happen, I'll apply the abreva 2 or 3 times a day for 2 days, and so far so good. Zero blisters since starting Abreva!!!! Anticipate your triggers and apply. That's the trick!!
Works great!.........Abreva Cold Sore/Fever Blister Treatment, .07-Ounce Tube It is the best product for a cold sore and it's a dollar cheaper than Walmart. I don't know who grades these reviews but my last review did not qualify? I have take my TIME out to write reviews because I shop on Amazon because of the reviews. I find it ODD when I'm denied...100% of the time I have seen the same format or type of reviews.... that have been ALLOWED!WOW...so this gets posted I have posted about or around 1000 reviews...So after rewriting and literally reviewing the reviewers it gets cleared??? This means that when mine get turned down than it's someone who just likes to feel powerful and say No for the sake of saying No! Wish I could identify them or report them.
I have terrible cold sores- enough so that I chronically take oral medications but still have break outs with any stress or lack of sleep, the watchwords of my existence.  Abreva really helps them heal quickly.  If I even notice the slightest spot, I start to use it and con often prevent an outbreak.  If I've been having problems and forget to use the Abreva for a day, I have major sores again.  It really heals.  I buy it through the shop and save program so it is routinely delivered to me, which makes an expensive product a bit less expensive.
I'm always skeptical about over-the-counter drug claims, but Abreva lives up to its reputation.  I occasionally get ugly, painful fever blisters but didn't want to spend the money trying a new "cure" since it isn't that often.  I was lucky that a co-worker swears by Abreva and loaned me some recently when I had a break-out.I applied Abreva at the first sign of my fever blister and used it for 48 hours and guess what -- it went away!  It did not expand past a little red bump.  No oozing or crusting over, no pain, nothing.  Just a red spot for a few days and then totally gone.I then came directly to amazon and ordered my own tube and I'll never leave home without it!
My 19- year old daughter gets breakouts on her chin and around her lips.  One time she also had a cold sore on her bottom lip and when I put the Abbreva on it, I thought "what the heck?" and put it on her face as well.We were astonished to see her acne-like face breakouts disappear within 2 days.I'm guessing that what we had been calling "acne" or "zits" was neither -- it was a virus the whole time causing her face to break out.  Now, whenever her face starts to breakout we put Abreva on it and it clears up fast.  Who knew?
If I could Dance Naked in Times Square.  I would shout with big Boom Boom Drum.  Black Cumin Seed, Black Seed Oil, No more cold sores and get to know your triggers, deep fired salty foods, lack of sleep, stress, keep hydrated, etc.  But if I could shout and sing; I say google Black Seed Oil, it all natural Ancient Mediterranean herb, it next to a MIRACLE, forget honey, ACV, forget coconut oil, Google and try, cured my asthma too.  Forget pharmaceuticals, forget FDA approved, I say go 100% natural.
At the first sign of a cold sore or fever blister, I will use this product. I coat the area often - reapplying every couple hours. About twenty minutes before reapplying, I take a piece of ice and hold it on the sore for as long as I can stand it. Generally off and on for those twenty minutes, then I put on more Abreva. I recently had the flu along with a high temp. This is a sure remedy for me to get a fever blister in one particular spot on my lips. I used my method for two days and the blister never erupted.***NOTE - don't stand over the sink when opening this teeny, tiny tube. If you drop the cap - which is even smaller then the tube, it will go straight down the drain. :-) I hope the manufacturer plan a redesign of this container and top.
I can't recommend Abreva highly enough. Whenever I feel a cold sore coming on (that tingling feeling in my lip) I start to apply it immediately. It helps cold sores to heal faster (occasionally they don't even completely "erupt"), AND it makes them less painful! Get several and keep one at work, at home, and in the car. You'll want to use it at the first sign of a cold sore! The price is pretty good on Amazon... it's as much as $25 in some drug stores. Also, be sure to get the tube, not the "pump." I found you waste a lot with the pump because you can't control how much product comes out each use.
I keep a tube at work and at home.  As soon as I feel a tingling sensation in the lip I apply this stuff.  It is awesome to have a much abbreviated cold sore outbreak on one's lip.  This stuff works awesome if you apply at the very earliest indication that you are going to get one.  This usually happens for me when I am stressed out at work with way too much to get done in the scheduled time.  Even though the tubes are incredibly small they last a long time for me.  A couple of tubes last me years and they don't seem to lose there efficacy w/ time.
Its been 30 or 35 yrs since I last had one of these sores and this product was not around then I don't recall it there was a medicine that did help but don't recall its name now but this stuff worked in a few days it was 100% better and in less then 10 days totally gone ..Greast stuff for me anyways worked as well as the old prescription I used to get from a Dr. back in the 70's and 60's I used to get them every few yrs when younger and under lots more stress .  And I'd never heard of this until I felt that tingle a few months back saw this product and gave it a try .. worked like a charm..
I bought this product when I lost the tiny Nexcare lipsore bottle.I have a coldsore that hurts SO much that I couldnt put medicated chapstick, wash it, nothing without it hurting. This was worse b/c when my lips would dry and I talked or yawn, the sore would split open more. Its painful that I didnt care for the price.The nexcare one did do well to numb my sore but being smaller, I lost it.*and it was expensive* So I bought this one and I was kinda pleased. It did numb my lips too and it kinda added a coat over the sore.All I do like abreva but its always sold out.
I have to deal with cold sores about once a month, and I've always used Abreva mostly because their arguments seem compelling... FDA approved, #1 pharmacists recommended, TV ads, blah blah blah. About 3 months ago, one of my sores was bigger than usual that wouldn't dry out after 5 days... it was ugly and painful. I decided to stop trusting advertising and went on buying every treatment available out there. I finally found one that REALLY helped me... Campho-Phenique. It burns, but it dries out my sores in just one to two days day. I finally decided to  write a review because two cold sores popped up last night, and they are gone tonight... they never had to opportunity to completely come out, and they are now dry.
Even though I have a big no kiss-hello policy, someone, someplace gave me a kiss and a little &#34;friend&#34; returns every now and then (Curse them!).  So a tiny little dab of Abreva knocks it back to the bowels of hell where cold sores obviously came forth. Do NOT spend full retail at a pharmacy for the exact same thing you can get here for less!  Yes, it costs a LOT per ounce, BUT you only need a little bit AND it works fast and amazingly!  Hate that I have to buy this, BUT it is worth it and works great!  Highly recommend Abreva!
I get fever blisters on my lips from exposure to the wind, the sun and whenever I'm exposed to a new virus but don't get the actual flu -- they have always taken so long to heal.  Abreva definitely SHORTENS that timeframe significantly and the blister doesn't get as big nor does it spread outwards.For best results -- PUT ON AT THE SIGN OF THE FIRST TINGLE - EVEN BEFORE YOU SEE IT -Do NOT pop the blister releasing viruses around - let the Blister go down naturally.  With Abreva -- it will not become as big and will go down faster.Don't &#34;rub&#34; Abreva in -- just blot it on and around the blister area and let it absorb naturally.  It will do the job.
The product is all it claims as an antacid and neutralizer. I have used the standard "AC" and complete for years. I never liked the berry flavored and I think many would agree as sometimes they expired on the shelf. Their pink pills were a great hit and worked fast.Now we have mint green tablets. I thing they dissolve faster. I know they call these mint flavor but they taste like wintergreen to me.There is no need to compare this product to any other, as it is enough to suffice that this product is fast, and long lasting. I keep some at home, office and car.
Pros: Extremely fast acting and long-lasting. One tablet does the job.Con: They have changed the mint taste. While I do think the new taste does leave more of a cool sensation [which is great], it is a little odd. However this isn't candy, so not knocking off a star. Just hope they don't "new and improve" a great product out of existence. Note: FYI, the "new and improved" bottles say "NEW Taste!" on the top, and the tablet color is a bluish-white.
I love the taste of this product. It is effective and works well. I like this much better than tums because I feel like one of these lasts a long time while I keep having to chew tums every two hours or so to get the same affect. It is more expensive, but I would recommend these over tums if you are a constant heartburn sufferer. Of course, like the instructions say be sure to go to the doctor if you have to constantly use a product like this. Better to get the cause of your problem resolved than to cover up the symptoms.
I've taken several kinds of prescription medications for my acid reflux, but none of them work as quickly and as well as Pepcid Complete!  Love the mint flavor--the berry is nasty.  I know there was a recall a few years ago because of foreign matter being found in a few jars, but this stuff is still hard to find in our local stores.  Too bad its expensive, but if you have acid reflux and don't want to get stuck taking daily prescription medication, this is the one to use.
I have been lucky not to have experienced much in the way of stomach or acid reflux issues&#8230;until now. Even with adjusting diet, I still get acid reflux on occasion. I don't like pills, so I wanted a chewable that worked quickly and lasted. This one seemed to be the best. I took one (you should only take 2 in 24 hours) and the taste was okay. I noticed improvement within a 1/2 hour. I don't think it permanently relieved the symptoms, but it was enough to not really notice it. That's all I wanted. I only had to take 1. It has been a week and so far, no flair ups&#8230;but I just had pizza and a coke tonight so we shall see! I'm sticking with Pepcid Complete.
This is my go to pill for acid reflux prevention.  When I (gasp) eat or drink too much, this puppy stills the roiling waters and keeps things where they belong.  It has been a really long time (not long enough) since I grossly over did my consumption however I still (rarely) over do it and this helps a great deal.  In addition I find that when my allergies are severe and post nasal drip is flowing briskly, this helps to keep my stomach from adding insult to allergy injury.  A good product.
Unless you need a pretty box, the mail order only version  (One Touch Ultra Mail Order Test Strips, 50 CT) is exactly the same as these, but cheaper.If you're paying for test strips yourself, you should look at the WaveSense meters. (See:Wavesense Keynote System Kit)  The WaveSense strips are roughly $9 per box less expensive.  If you're using 8-10 strips per day, that translates to a $1000+- savings each year.  The WaveSense meters also claim to be more accurate than other systems.
I have been buying and using this product for several years and swear by it. I thought I had found a great place to order it from Amazon. Unfortunately, the seller sent me a cheaper version of the product and my attempts to contact them were ignored.  So, I'm returning it. It doesn't seem that hard to me to tell the difference in 2 a day Triple Strength and 4 a day regular strength. I guess they thought I wouldn't notice the difference. I paid for a 2 month supply and got a l month supply.
I have tried others and this one so far is the best. The price that Amazon has for this item is so  much cheapier than in Walgreens. I love that I have it set to be sent every two months.For those with joint issues and yes if you are 40 and over you will have or start to have this, this product is great. I did feel a difference after taking it for one week and now take it every day.No side effects and the two tablets are big but from others I have tried who require three or four a day this one is just two a day!
I have osteo arthritis that affects almost all the joints in my body. The Osteo Bi-Flex took the knee pain away with in a week of starting it. It hasn't done much for the other areas of arthritis pain but it's great not having sharp knee pain when I walk. I used it previously for a couple of months and when I stopped taking it my knee pain returned. I started taking it again, no knee pain! I will continue to take it from here on out! Amazon subscribe & save has the best price!  I have a bottle shipped to my house every 2 months!
I love this product..have been using it for years, especially liked when they added the 2000 IU of D3. But check out the new ingredients. The Joint Shield with 5-Loxin used to be 1288 mg but now with the 33% smaller caplets they reduced the Joint Shield to just 375 mg.I called the company about this and they admitted they changed the formula sooooooo...if you want the old formula of the 1288 mg. Joint Shield you'll now have to buy it without the 2000 IU of Vitamin D3, they no longer make that formula. I had to purchase Vitamin D separately because of this new change.I bought the smaller caplets before I realized they changed the formula. Pretty sneaky of them to do this without advising their customers. If I didn't like this product so much I would switch brands.
After the first day of using this product, I began getting headaches; especially in the back of the head and neck.These headaches increased in strength & duration with each day of use until finally, after 1 week, I had to stop using them.The headaches became debilitating.As soon as I stopped taking the product, the headaches stopped.One month later I decided to try Osteo Bi-Flex and the EXACT same thing happened, again.Now, I was sure the headaches were due to the product, in my situation.Other people seem to have a good response, unfortunately, I did not.I felt I should report my experience with Osteo Bi-Flex.Plus, I had NO pain relief at all from this product.
...anybody (and especially a male) who shares their home with one (or more) women over the age of 13 has probably made this mistake when working from a shopping list: you see a woman's beauty product on your list, and then buy something close...but not *exactly* the listed item.Big mistake. I did this once with Venus cartridges, and paid a major price. You'd have thought I tried to import smallpox into the house when I showed up with what was considered an inferior off-brand.These are the only blades for women I'm allowed to bring home. Ever.I tried a new Venus on my face one time: very similar to theFusion cartridgesthat are my own choice for shaving.
Gilette Shaving Cartridges / B00005AUIESeems like no matter what I shave with, I get painful ingrown hairs afterwards, so I've pretty much given up on shaving unless I absolutely have to. However, for those times when I must, I feel that the Venus razors cause the fewest ingrown hairs, so I rely on these to minimize problems. These babies are sharp as can be - I'm not sure about the "no nicks" part, since they certainly can and do cut up my knees and ankles if I'm not super careful. Probably I'm just clumsy.These refill cartriges work with theGillette Venus Razor,.~ Ana Mardoll
I ordered these through Amazon because they were cheaper than any price I could find in local stores by about $3. That being said, they are still ridiculously expensive. Come on! They're razor blades..a chunk of plastic with a few tiny strips of steel embedded in it. But they do give a close, smooth shave without nicking up my shins, and they last a long time, so I pay the price and grumble. The 3 star rating is an attempt to temper my assessment of the product itself (more like 5 stars) with what appears to be overpricing (more like 1 star).
I don't know about other people, but I can talk myself out of a purchase like this at the store in just 5 seconds.  Generally I pick up the item, I see a line- then I put the item down and leave.  I just don't want to deal with lines for something as boring as razors. I'd rather just be the hairiest woman on earth.So when I realized I could buy them on Amazon, with S&S; for the same price as at the store I immediately signed up.  It's amazing. I always have refill cartridges now, and my boyfriend (bless his good natured heart) no longer has to travel through wookie land to get to my legs.
My wife very much enjoys using these cartidges for all her shaving needs. She uses them in the shower regularly, and they last her a long time (at least three weeks usually). She has the power razor, but we opted for the cheaper non-power cartridges, which work just fine. There is still plenty of lubricant on them to provide a smooth shave. Definitely not cheap, but worth paying the extra money for a smooth shave and no nicks and cuts. Amazon pricing is WAAAY better than in most (if not all) stores.
Like my title says, I've been using these razors for a long time now (8+ years). These give me the closest shave and are very comfortable. I have not cut myself w/ these razors once (expect for when it was completely my own fault.... slipped and jabbed my thigh w/ the hand w/ the razor in it as I was trying to regain balance.... BIG gash, lots of blood, not pretty!! Moral: be careful!). All in all, these are really good razors, easy to replace by popping out the old and putting in the new ones, gives a close shave, and doesn't nick you (unless you're clumsy like me).Definitely would recommend!
My wife likes these plain ones over the ones with moisture bars and the such. The fancier ones not only cost more but they are mostly useless when the moisture bar runs out, even if the blades are still sharp. Just use decent shaving lotion and you should have no problems with this razor. Sometimes simpler is better.I normally buy these at the store, but they were cheaper on amazon so I now purchase them here.I am giving it 4 stars, although it is better than the $18-22 price in stores, the $16 price on amazon is still way to high for the product. Although I can't say how much Gillette charges for companies to buy these, I would say $10 is a fair price.
I was looking for an inexpensive replacement to some of the high-protein powders I was buying and/or the pre-made muscle milk/atkins drinks I'd get. This didn't work out so well for me. First off, with water, I did not like the taste/texture at all. I gave it a try with milk and I ended up getting sick. That could have had more to do with drinking milk first thing in the morning, but either way it was an unpleasant start to my work day. I subsequently went and tried Muscle Milk powder which I like a lot better. It's more expensive, but it's worth it compared to this stuff.
***Update to the update:  It's back!***The carb solutions chocolate shake mix is really one of the best ways to help get through those days when you are really bonking on the diet.  Plus the high levels of potassium are helpful for those in the really low carb (early) stage of the diet.  I found the vanilla to be awful...personally and could not recommend it to anyone.  Hint:  I always throw in a handfull of ice cubes to make the shake a little slushy and occasionally will drop in a teaspoon of peanut butter for some extra protien and a little more flavor.
I was a little skeptical before purchasing this - especially when the picture simply shows something that looks like a toothbrush - but all fears were put to rest after one use.  The head is wide, round and flat like a quarter and I'm able to brush the back of my tongue without major gagging.  I didn't think it would be possible but it works great!  The bristles are pretty strong and I found it was easy to over-do it in the beginning (brushing too long, too hard).  Just follow the instructions (which tell you not to do that) and everything will be fine.  I'm sold!
Hello, EveryoneI'm a type of guy who reads almost every single review negative and positive and come up with a conclusion for myself. I also very heavily rely on the star rating. Anything 3 stars and below I'm very careful to order; anything 4/5 stars I still do my work but rely more on peoples reviews.Delivery: Arrived quicklyCondition: Undamaged, great condition.Product itself: This product works along with its tongue gel it gets rid of that nasty white gunk on your tongue that causes bad breath!Recommend it: Yes I would.
I like how it does a better job of cleaning the gunk off of my tongue than a scraper but, I use both of them. I like the firmer bristles than ones found on a toothbrush. Yes, my tongue bled and was sore the first few times that I used it but I didn't mind. That gel though, bleurgh! Nasty stuff made me gag so hard I thought I was going to choke! Not for everyone I guess. I just use a bit of toothpaste, it does the job. Yeah the gel says that it's supposed to do some fancy cleaning but so what, I'm still not going to use it.
I've been using TUNG products since 2005, and I am still convinced that the TUNG tongue brush & tongue gel are the best products to cleaning the fiesty & gunky germs that love to rest on our tongues.Make sure you also use this tongue gel with theThe Original TUNG Brush - Tongue Cleaner with TUNG Gel Sample. The tongue brush does wonders and gently massages and scrapes off nasty germs.The tongue gel is minty, fresh, and fairly tolerable. The consistency and smell of the gel keeps gagging minimal.The TUNG gel, combined with the TUNG brush does wonders and still is the best for tongue hygiene.
These are great to have on hand for quickly wiping up anything germy or gross. I use these for going over the toilet seat in between scrubbings. I sometimes use them on the dogs feet, but I mostly use the Sensitive ones for them. These dispense okay once you get them going, but when you first pull them through the top, a few extras come out which is annoying. These are great to have on hand and I like the special designs they use on the limited edition packages from time to time.&#8203;
About my exercise regime - workout at least 5 days per week for the past 10 years. I've tried multiple types of protein powders and mostly good results (it's better than taking nothing, although eating real foods has given me the best results). Being a business professional, and working 70 hours a week, I don't really have time to be making the perfect post workout meal or breakfast every day. I gave this product a 4 star review because I think that the Optima Nutrition Whey Protein gave me better results (especially when mixed with the casein after an evening workout). I'm 6'2" 200lbs and have 2 scoops of the whey in the morning and 1 scoop whey with 1 scoop casein after my workout (normally in the evening). Always mixed with water. This has given me the best results.whey:http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GIURM2/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_til?tag=emilroviperst-20&camp;=0&creative;=0&linkCode;=as1&creativeASIN;=B000GIURM2&adid;=1XVPRSSTKG2461HTMY69Caesin:http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002DYJ0M0/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_til?tag=emilroviperst-20&camp;=0&creative;=0&linkCode;=as1&creativeASIN;=B002DYJ0M0&adid;=14HZS2FZRWFYS57KDMXD
This is the best toothpaste I have ever used. I've been using it for a long time. Every once in a while I will switch up, trying to find a brand that works as well but is cheaper, but I have had no luck. I drink coffee every day so I have to stay on top of it or my teeth get yellow pretty quickly.One star off because it's pretty expensive for toothpaste.The texture did change a while ago (it got thinner) but it's smoother and seems to work as well for me.I don't think it's an Amazon problem because what I have bought from the drugstore is the same consistency.
I purchased this product to whiten my teeth. I drink at least 4 cups of coffee per day and needed something to remove the surface stains. This product claimed to do better than remove surface stains from teeth but also to &#34;clean deep&#34; (what ever that means). In any case, after trying the product there was little to no significant difference.  A few weeks later I tried Crest 3D white and within in 1 week my teeth were super white and month felt fresh for hours at the fraction of what this product cost. I would not purchase again.
I have to admit, I don't really don't put a lot of thought into my toothpaste. It really isn't a case of not knowing what my teeth need, it is always a case of my financial standing and like many, I go for the sale items/coupon combination which means I usually have a supply of 10 tubes that I spent about 33 cents on always at the ready.  HOWEVER, that being said, now that I have tried the Rembrandt Collection, I don't know that I can go back to buying anything else.We were horoughly impressed. My favorite is the Intense Stain paste. WOW. Just WOW. I can honestly say there is a definite difference in this paste compared to others. This is it for me. Even my 7 year old although she finds it very minty asks for it after she has berries to brush. I LOVE it and will tell everyone about this paste.
The Ultrasonex SB300U Rechargeable Toothbrush is the best I ever had.Unlike most reviewers, I had it for over 3 years AND I own bothSoniCare and Braun toothbrushes, each in almost all versions[I have been using electric toothbrushes for about 30 years].Nothing beats the Ultrasonex SB300U Rechargeable Toothbrush.I use it together with the Braun mouth irrigator [I own at least 5 of thosetoo but the Braun is the best]. BTW, I found that most dentistsknow nothing about electric tooth brushes and irrigators except whattheir salespeople tell them. So it is pretty stupid when a reviewer refersto a dentist. BTW, this is the 1st review I ever wrote for Amazon.Paul Nevai [I am just a tremendously satisfied customer]N.B. For the best effectiveness, just brush with it as if it were a regular toothbrush.
Bought two originally for my wife and I to replace my sonicare whose battery died (non-replaceable NiCd). We liked it so much, we bought two more for the kids who had a rotating toothbrush, and they love it too. Compared to sonicare, the battery charge seemingly lasts forever. I had to charge the sonicare every few days (I unplug the charger/holder so I can cycle the NiCd batteries for longer life). The SB300U lasts more than one week with each charge: great for trips. While the sonicare brushes probably go through more gyrations so you don't need to move as much, this brush gets the job done. I find the balance and size is much better than other electric toothbrushes on the market. I still would like to see these electronic manufacturers allow for replacing the NiCds. Such a waste to throw out the equipment for want of a $1 battery.
This trimmer works beautifully.  It minimizes hair and makes it much easier to shave or wax, saving you time, razorblades, and pain.  I also use it on my arms, which reduces the appearance of the hair without giving that weird hairless shaven arm look.  My only complaint is that the shortest setting is .125 inches, which is still a considerable amount of hair.  Sometimes I remove the "safety" head and use just the metal part to get a closer trim, but you have to be sure to shave in the direction that the hair grows or it can pinch.  I have had mine for about a year of regular use and it is still going strong.
This bikini trimmer works well.  My only issue with it is that, if you also epilate, you might as well save the money and buy the Braun 5270 Silk-&eacute;pil X'elle Body System Epilator:Braun 5270 Silk-&eacute;pil X'elle Body System EpilatorThis has a bikini trimmer attachment that can trim the hair down south.If you want just a bikini trimmer, or you like to be able to shape the hair more exactly, this is a good choice.  However, if you just need to trim down, and also epilate, the Braun product does a decent job of just trimming it down---the price of it is a little over double of the trimmer, but therefore works well as a combination product for a couple different needs.
As someone who gets a shaving rash by just looking at a razor, and doesn't have the budget for regular bikini waxes (plus, OUCH!), this product was a dream come true.  I've been using it regularly for about 4 months.  The blade seems as sharp as ever, and I'm still on my first set of batteries.  If you want to get a close shave, you can take off the guard.  Never use this while in a rush.  It doesn't take long to use, but you can nick yourself if you're not being attentive.I really could not be more satisfied with this purchase!  It works exactly the way it's supposed to, the price is reasonable, and I've even recommended it to several of my girlfriends, who have been equally as pleased.
My boyfriend happily bought this for me, upon request, when I decided I wanted to try going bare. I figured that I'd use it to trim my bikini area as a prep for shaving. However, I soon found out that a) my skin down there is far too sensitive to handle a razor, and b) this little trimmer is all I actually need!I discovered that by taking off the plastic guard, and being VERY careful, I got a trim almost as close as a shave. It's a perfect (and powerful) bikini trimmer, easy to handle for smaller hands like mine, and gets into the creases and tight spots without any trouble. I absolutely love it! And I wish I'd discovered it sooner, because now I can't imagine going back to being au natural. Definitely an item worth purchasing. DEFINITELY.
This does a great job trimming the bikini area.  It's a nice size - slim and light, feels good in the hand, not too loud.  I was worried I wouldn't be able to trim as short as I want.  With the attachment on, you can get down to 1/8" (their measurement).  But if you want to go shorter, just take the attachment off.  I'm careful using it without the attachment because I don't want to nick myself - I use it gently and don't press.  But I haven't nicked myself yet.
The good, it trims well and doesn't catch the skin.The not so good:  the slide up gauge to cut hair longer is useless. It only trims at the shortest setting.  It eats batteries, power is noticeably decreased after a few uses.  I would prefer a corded unit.  Lastly, why does every manufacturer figure that women want to shave their girly bits with awful pastel colored contraptions.  Pastels are not sexy!  They don't scream modern woman, hear me roar!  It screams &#34;we have product designers who decorated the set of The Brady Bunch!&#34;  They could at least have some fun with the design of it
This trimmer is comfortable to hold, which is important for those of us with carpal tunnel syndrome, and comfortable to use.  It does a very good, even job and has 5 different settings so that you can have the hair length you prefer.  Those who prefer longer lengths can have it while still getting the benefits of an even trim.As another reviewer noted, the trimmer does not come with the bag shown in the picture, which means that you get to figure out a way to keep the trimmer and the brush together.  For this reason and because I would have liked the trimmer to cut just a tiny bit closer, I give it 4 stars instead of 5.Really, though, those issues are very minor, and I'm quite happy with the trimmer.  I'd definitely recommend it!
Our local hospitals have patients use this for 2 days prior to surgery and the morning of surgery to prevent MRSA and other skin infections.  I decide it was a good idea to have some on hand.  The physician recommended that we not use it regularly but only once a week or every other week and not use on face or private areas.  The pre-surgery instructions are: Shower normally then  apply a small amount of the Hibiclens to the body and extremities (about 1 ounce) wait 2 minutes and rinse off. .
We bought this because my son and husband came down with staph infections, and it was very helpful clearing those up.  I am in love with this stuff for a different reason.  I had developed an odor in my-um- private area.  It was quite embarassing and smelled bad even right out of the shower after washing with Dial.  After a hot day in Alabama it was awful.  I tried Hibiclens and the problem is GONE.  I don't care how much this stuff costs, I will never run out.  This is a pretty harsh cleanser though, I have eczema on my legs mostly in the winter, and I cannot use this on my legs.  It makes them dry and itch like wildfire...
I originally was ordered by the doctor to use this for washing because I had MRSA (methicillian resistant staph infection.)  It kept me from getting open sores.  Well, The Lord Jesus healed me of MRSA and the doctor told me I could stop using this for washing.  Mistake - as I started to get fungal rash (jock itch) and my 50year old face would get pimples.  Well, I ordered this again and things are clearing up - don't plan to run out again if I can help it! I have super sensitive red-headed fair skin and this does not irritate my skin at all, but cleanses.
I had MRSA a few years ago and was instructed by my doctor to use this everytime I shower.  I use it in a pump and use it in the crevices of the body.  I'm free of the MRSA for years after a few reoccurences and using this product.  May none of you have to deal with that.  Buy this product if it is recommended to you by your doctor or if you have people in your family that get cuts and bruises.  I would use it on any open wound any day of the week.
While any review of this product would not be a surprise the merchant does need a pat too!I have purchased this item for years and have just started to purchase it here on Amazon from "REGENT MEDICAL" and wanted to say that REGENT MEDICAL not only offers a great price but also excellent shipping & handling.The bottle comes securely in a padded box with tape used over the lid to prevent spilling (unlike other merchants I use to order from) and it always arrives ahead of the scheduled delivery date.I would sign-up for the "scheduled delivery" option here on Amazon but not sure if it would always be sent by the same REGENT MEDICAL that I have been making sure to order from in the past.I will be ordering more of our medical items through REGENT MEDICAL in the near future!THANK YOU!
I saw people complaining about safety seals and I was astonished to find that all my shampoos don't have them either!!!  What is the world coming to??? Seriously, I can not one wit about those comments.  Had I found that the stuff seemed to be weak or diluted, that might be another issue, but I have not found that to be the case.  This stuff works great.  And if you are prone to infection due to a weakened immune system, then it is really the way to go.  I have even used this stuff on my scalp and it really has reduced the duration of any stress related scalp issues and seems to inhibit them as well.  It is now a rudimentary item in my regimen against infection.
This was recommended to me by my dermatologist after a minor fungal infection. I have been using this regularly long after and it has helped keep skin infections, fungal or otherwise, in check. I cleanse with this at the end of a shower 2-3 times a week. The antiseptic solution itself is fairly mild - doesn't make the skin dry, easy on the skin, and has a nice gentle fragrance to it.The only word of caution is to keep it away from children. While the solution is mild for adults, our 6-yr old accidentally used this to wash his face and his eyes were burning after. We had to wash it out thoroughly with water. Nothing terrible, but something worth avoiding. Hope this helps.
This stuff kicks butt on Staph and ugly friends.I get a staph infection now and then on my stomach area around the button. I don't know why. Doctor does not know why. I pour a little in my hand and scrub it up and rinse it down.I do this about 3 times, in three days and after about a week the skin irritation is completely gone. Stupid doctor wants to put me on antibiotics. NO! An apple a day keeps the doctor away and two apples a day keeps his greedy partner away too!Use sparingly.
Chlorohexidine is a powerful antiseptic that kills both Gram positive and Gram negative skin pathogens.  Hibiclens is a standard of care for handwashing and wound disinfection in many hospitals.  Many people use Hibiclens as a pre-scrub several days before an anticipated surgery, with the intent that it will inhibit bacteria and prevent post-operative infection.  At 4% concentration, this is very strong.  Avoid contact with eyes, nose, mouth, rectum, as at this concentration, it is quite irritating to non-skin mucosa.Although expensive, this is perhaps the best hand cleanser on the open market.  Use it at home during flu season to reduce the liklihood of cross infection.konedog
Great product, but make sure you read the directions.  You need to keep this away from eyes.  This is a serious skin cleaner, the type that is often given to patients for pre-op preperation. The &#34;anti-bacterial&#34; ingredients in most soaps wash away.  This product's active ingredients keep working after you have rinsed.  Some folks swear on its usefulness for Acne or persistant odor problems.  I used it when I had a minor skin infection in a place that was hard to bandage all day.  It works, but again, read the directions.
Promptly shipped from seller (Regent Medical).  This is a great product, and helps me feel clean when I use it.  It is a pleasantly scented (very low fragrance), pink liquid.  I use it mixed in with my body wash occaisionally for a great all-over clean.  Gentle to use, I haven't had any issues with it on my sensative skin and it rinses totally away leaving you feel cleaner than regular soap (a few other bodywash/soaps leave behind a bit of a 'filmy' residue on your skin).  I also have used it in my laundry as an alternative to bleach (mixed 1-1 with water) to ensure white whites and without the harshness of bleach and/or the chemical smell of bleach.  Will purchase this product again, and the larger bottle (32 oz) is a much better buy.
I bought a small bottle per the advice of my doctor after having reoccurring staph infections.  I think we have finally got this taken care of, but as I began to read about other people's experiences using this soap...I decided to bathe in it, not just use it for washing hands.  I can't believe how clean my body feels.  Scars on my body are fading.  I don't even have to use a face wash for acne anymore...my face has been clear for a whole month straight now.  Amazon is definitely the way to go when purchasing this product, by bulk if possible.  I do miss my bath & body shower gels because I love to smell pretty, but having a truly clean body is more important to me.  Be sure to rinse thoroughly from creases like your armpit...can cause a bit of irritation.  I could go on about it, but you really need to try it for yourself & see how clean it makes you feel.
This product was recommended by my doctor after he found MRSA in my nasal passages. It is what surgeons use to "scrub up". However you will have to find the pump that fits the bottle and buy it (with extra for shipping of the pump http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V89QME/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00 ) from another seller. The cleanser is great. I use it in the shower and next to the sink. Just wish I hadn't had to go looking for the pump elsewhere! But a must have if you have cancer or other immune problems. I'm told it kills stuff that grocery store antibacterial hand soaps don't.
This is the same stuff that surgeons and nurses use in hospitals.  I ordered this to kill germs on my hands. Also when I feel a rash or infection or have a small cut I wash with this. I am more cautious about catching germs now when in public places or restrooms, handling shopping carts etc. I wash my hands often during the day.  I once caught MRSA when waiting in an outpatient family room. I don't want hepatitis from eating out either. If you don't know what MRSA is goggle it. Believe me you do not want it or any other disease.  I'm no a clean freak, but just cautious and take less chances now.
My doctor suggested I try Hibiclens to combat my recent bout with adult acne. Because not only do I contend with crow's feet as I've aged, but I also have zits! While in the shower, I rub the pink liquid into my skin (avoiding mouth and eyes) and let it stay on for a few minutes. Then I rinse my face well, making sure to remove all of it. I only use it once or twice a week so my skin doesn't dry out. And my acne has improved! It's not perfect, but at least I don't have to buy any expensive prescriptions.
This is an excellent product but please use it with 'Caution'.  It worked for me to remove pimple/acne and get rid of the smell after the exercise... read the warnings on the label... Accident may happen so the safest way is completely avoiding the head and facial wash...If it gets into the mid-ear, it can cause deafness and blindness if it gets inside the eye. Just be careful do not let it get inside of your body. This stuff destroys membranes and kills cells.
I tried this after reading all the fabulous reviews on here. But I am impatient when it comes to my mobility- people seem to take that for granted. I don't have the tolerance or moxie to wait around for something to work. Maybe if I was elderly, but I am young and I feel like I am imprisoned in this useless body.Anyway, sorry for the diatribe, but yea, I took Cosamin for a few weeks, and it did nothing for me, well I lie. It did raise my blood sugars a bit, but I am willing to trade off on high blood sugars for my mobility.The absolute best things for joints is Zymosine and Flexcin. But if you are allergic to shellfish or have diabetes, I would probably stay away from them.
I have had multiple spine surgeries, shoulder and wrists surgically worked on. I have auto immune issues. I used to take prescription Meloxicam anti inflammatory meds every day for past five years to help with pain. I had to stop due to stomach issues. I tried this Cosamin DS and after the initial two weeks of taking 3 or 4 pills daily I am down to 2 pills daily and it does seem to help with the pain in my joints. Its not completely gone, but anything that helps me get thru the day without taking meds that are hard on my stomach is a godsend. I would say try it --- if it works its worth the money spent!
We bought this Odor Eater Foot & Sneaker Spray because my teenage son's shoes were seriously foul smelling. The stench from his shoes made our living room smell like a poorly maintained locker room. It was so bad that we started making him take his shoes off outside (and I am surprised that the neighbors didn't complain :-) but his socks would still bring the smell inside with him. Using this spay worked very well and only two applications completely resolved the problem.I also like that it contains and antifungal component to help prevent athlete's foot.This works quickly and is fairly priced!Highly Recommended!CFH
This is my 3rd hitachi. They last a really long time IF you don't use any of the stupid attachments. Taking the attachments on and off will weaken the foam pad and eventually it will be bent and unable to stay focused in the right place.I do not recommend using any attachments. Just use it as is and it will last forever!I also suggest investing in a longer power cord ;)Best vibrator everthe only one you'll ever need(with the exception of a rabbit vibrator, which I also cannot live without)
This wand has been perfect for working all kinds of knots out.I purchased it with a Lutron Dimmer and it works great.  The dimmer does reduce the maximum intensity, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing.  If you need all the power just don't use the dimmer.  If you want a bit less intensity the dimmer provides perfect fine grained control, better than a massager with multiple settings.The only real negative is that the cord on this is very short.  An extension cord is required in practically any case.
I am so happy that this product works when plugged and not like others that you have to wait to power up and use 10 mins at a time.I am sure this product is used more often for orgasms than what I use it for but it works better than any other product I have used for my needs.I love the soft top. With two speeds I only need to use the low speed to get the comfort level but high pulsing I need.I knit a lot and it use has helped my palms after hours of knitting. I get cramps in my arches and lower back and in a short time the pain is relieved.Thank you so much
First off let me say I bought this for muscle spasm relief only, while it seems to help a little I feel this device is more aimed for female use than male. I typically use it on high speed mode, and I find it can't reach deep into the muscle tissue so in essence it's not going to replace a good physical massage by a masseuse.  I often feel like I'm going to break the head off of the device when I'm trying to work out a spasm knot.  My wife likes it though and it seems to help her issues with aches and pains.I'd would say if your a athletic build male looking for muscle relief from this, you may be disappointed but I'm giving it 4 stars for not totally worthless as it does help.  I'm investing in a theracane or back buddy as an alternate.
Pros:durablevibrations are crazy good for both male a femaleas a muscle massager, it feels great as wellCons:Cord is a little short to bring to the middle of a king sized bedFinal thoughts:I bought this for my girlfriend to kind of try something new in the bedroom.  I had her lay down and relax and I slipped under the sheets and did my thing on the low vibration setting.  Her toes curled, her legs shook, and she was all smiles.  We've even tried it together where she'd place it on her lower pelvis during missionary and I can feel the vibrations as well!  Buy it, you won't be disappointed.
I have to admit, I'm really happy with this purchase. At first with the box it seemed a little old like the design hasn't been changed in some time. But don't let that bother you as it was simply amazing!First off, it helps with tough knots. Not a bad massager really at all. I used it on my shoulders and upper back and a few random spots after working out or long days.Secondly, it's great for what we all know you others do with it! My girlfriend loved it. Very powerful which is a must! It drives her mad! (in a good way of course!)The best part are the attachments. I'd check out the trinity attachment for the g-spot.Worth what you are paying and some!Only downside is a short cord which isn't that bad.
if you want to say it has the name you would be right. tried to save a buck and ended up with what does seem to be a hitachi fraud. I gave the shibari good reviews it turned out to be junk. this is built just like the Chinese clone. motor not as big head comes off and if your going to copy the better one try making the buttons work down and up not up and up. hitachi is the best massager and even though prices went up its good to pay for the one and original. not Chinese clones. my original hitachi lasted about 5 yrs this one will likely be the same as the shibari...burned out after a month....gave it two stars just because it worked and I hate sending things back!
I got this for my wife. Actually she was my girlfriend at the time. So, how's a guy supposed to feel when his lady, dripping with sweat and gasping for air, says "OMG! Where have you been all my life?" and she's not talking to me, but to this Hitachi buzz-thrill?!Well, what can I say? I got over it, and she married me. Me, her, and the Magic Wand--a threesome I can live with.We've actually found other uses for it, like for an occasional strained muscle or lower back pain. I like to touch it to my nose. This makes me sneeze in no time. Try it...it's a hoot!But seriously...this is a great thing all around. Oft-used, multi-purpose, loved by all. A purchase you are highly unlikely to regret. Get an extension cord for convenience.
When I first got it, I pluged it in then turned it on and I could barely hear it, even at both speeds. But when I put an attachment on it, the whole thing started rattling and got very loud. The motor in this thing is a beast and needs to be held down better. First I wrapped the whole thing in 3M tape, then installed two hose clamps an inch from the top of the wand and then wrapped 3M tape around them again. It tightend up the motor so it wouldn't vibrate in its cradle. This made the wand sound almost exactally the same as it did without the attachments. You can finish the entire wand and cord with tape for a better look as the white will eventually get dirty and fade to yellow anyways. The hose clamp knobs can act as finger grips!
I bought this for my wife after reading the stellar reviews on this and other sites. The statements you commonly read are accurate. It is big and somewhat noisy and needs to be plugged in, which is slightly annoying. But when all is said and done, these criticisms fall by the wayside because there is not another vibrator out there that is as effective. The rabbit vibrators are pretty decent and my wife claims they work well. However, with this my wife routinely has three to five climaxes, without fail. She raves about it constantly and recommends it to her friends.
I know everyone swears by the Hitachi Magic Wand as a sex toy, but I tried it *on my shoulder* and found it too intense there. It made my skin itchy and numb. I can't imagine trying it on a more intimate location. (Also, the bulb is pretty big -- fine for massaging a shoulder, lower back, neck, etc., but maybe not so great for ... smaller body parts.) I don't know -- I realize I'm in the minority here, but I'm disappointed. (I gave it three stars because it definitely works -- I would feel bad giving it a lower rating when it operates as advertised.)
Got here fast. This thing just melts the stress locked up in neck and shoulder muscles away. I have used it on my neck, shoulders, back, legs, even feet and face (might want to clean it between the two) it is an awesome massager. Has very strong vibrations. I wouldn't recommend for what some other people have bought it for (you know what I mean). It is simply not designed for that. I would recommend for someone for massage particularly of the neck, having someone to do it for you does make it easier, it is heavy and bulky.Big and heavy would be my only complaint.
I really like this as a massager. It feels great on back and neck tension.For its "other" uses, I actually find the vibration too intense. The high setting is just too much. The "low" setting feels better through underwear or shorts. Otherwise, it chafes my thighs!I love that it doesn't require batteries. I know I was always wondering what it feels like, so, here you go: It's heavy and plastic. The head is slightly flexible and is made of a material similar to a steering wheel.I do really love the product, though. It's a great new addition to mine, and my partner's life. He loves getting a back massage after a long day's work!
I was very disappointed with this item. The various vibration points seem to be effective, but the hand-held controller is not very user friendly: it's just clumsy the way the buttons are set up. The size of the entire cushion is a bit on the small size and it really does not reach the neck and misses key parts of the back. Finally, and worse of all, is the small heat pad surface (only about 6x10 in) with the unexpected and very disappointing feature that the heating is pressure activated. While I would expect that meant that one has to sit against the pad to draw some localized heat, I could never feel any heat coming from the pad (with the controller asking for heat). While the price is good, the performance and its not meeting my expectations led me to return the item immediately.
Dealing with an aching back while sitting in my car or at my desk has become a chronic problem for me in the past 2 years.  I have tried various cushions, pillows, chairs, etc. to try and find comfort.  I was so happy to find this product!  It is a fantastic value and works great!  I really like the variety of settings available and it has made driving my car so much more confortable and relaxing.  In fact, I was so pleased with it, I bought one for my husband's car the very next day.  Now we both enjoy using this cushion during our travels.UPDATE:  7 days after receiving this and using it moderately for only 7 days, two of the motors stopped working completely.  Amazon just doubled the priced of this item so to replace it would now cost double the original price I paid since they will not do exchanges in a situation like this.  NOT SO HAPPY NOW....
It's not all that I expected: the heat doesn't seem to ever even get warm. The heat is timed for nine minutes, and after that time I still don't feel any warmth on my back (it isn't designed to warm the thighs). I bought this, expecting a warm massage, but it doesn't deliver on that expectation. The massage is at several specific points. As long as that is what you expect, it's fine. Don't expect the effect that you get from the ones that have moving rollers - the roller types cover a larger area, and are more to my liking. But this unit's massage is okay, since it's what I expected when I went in. I just wish the heat was at least warm.
This is the WORST massage cushion I have ever had. It's not because the massage functions are bad or that the heat sucks, no those were great... when they worked.I got this for Christmas, So I have had it only a little over 1 month.Day 3 the display screen stops working.... annoying but I figure I can use it without it.Week 2 the bottom seat vibrators stop working... arghh, what next?Week 4 The remote starts to completely crap out on me, seat shuts off on it's own after 4-5 minutes, display flickers and it won turn on correctly without holding the buttons down.I take good care of my stuff, it's never suffered abuse or been dropped. This piece of crap isnt built to last, not for the price. I asked for a slightly more expensive one this time (it cost $50) and it's worthless, my Homedics one cast half as much and last 2 years of everyday use. :(
okay today i got this lube, and i am like lets give it a quick try, this thing dry so fast unbeleiveable, plus it makes ur skin so sticky, i added water worked for about 10 sec then dries again quick, so i am like lets stick with just the water lol.. but ya this product sucks, i ordered it just because it was high rated and i guess the only people who put it in high rated were the ones who owns the brand... so my $9.48 went right down to the trash...
Great lube works amazing and makes everything a slipping slide. I use it for toys and will use it in a relationship when I get one... &#34;mind your business unless your trying to take me to the movies&#34; hahaha. But this lube is known for being your go to lubricant for toys and anal sex so if your new to lubes you may not need this big ass bottle but if your gonna be putting it on someone then you might. Other then that it's great to use love it.
I (female) am usually really sensitive to lubes.  This lube doesn't give me any issues, and works well for anal and vaginal penetration.  I've never had a water based lube that worked well for anal, but this does somehow!  This is, in my opinion, the best multipurpose lube we've tried (meaning for toys, anal, vaginal...it works for everything).  There are better lubes on the market, but nothing quite as versatile for the price.  JO lubes, for example, are hands down my favorite lubes, but each seems to be more specialized for a specific purpose, and are all quite pricey.  Overall, if you are looking for a high quality, well rounded lube, I highly recommend this one!
After using your typical drug store based lubricants (ie KY brand), I bought this off a website. I thought for sure it would last forever because there's so much but we must be compensating because we've used quite a bit already.ID Glide has a wonderfully slick texture and doesn't feel gloopy or sticky like other lubricants. It doesn't take much at all and your parts don't wind up feeling sticky after a while, unlike other lubricants.It also has a slightly sweet taste which we found out quite by accident but it was a pleasant surprise.Additionally, ID Glide is okay to use with condoms!
We are an older couple who was checking out the alternatives to the usual tubes of AstroGlide and K-Y. We really didn't expect to find anything better, so ID Glide was a very pleasant surprise. It does in fact give a very smooth and sensuous sensation that bests the others. The lady loves somewhat copious quantities, and we have discovered that it can be so exciting for a man that it can take the sensuality of a hand job to heights that are more pleasurable than oral sex. For women who may not feel in a good position to offer oral sex, ID Glide essentially opens the door to some new levels of sexual experience that a man may feel are more preferable. Between the two of us, we can think of nothing that would not benefit from ID Glide, and the lady was asking me to order more when we still had two-thirds of the bottle left. In her own mind, she's already written off the other brands and means to toss the remaining amounts. I hope this helps.
This lotion has a great scent (peppermint and plum), and also invigorates your skin.  Peppermint has the botanical property of cooling hot skin, and this lotion definitely gets the job done.  It's also great for your legs, after you've just come out the of shower.  Be sure to use Freeman's Foot Soak, the Freeman Exfoliant (I reccomend you stick to the same scent as the lotion), and then follow with the Bare Foot Softening Lotion.  This stuff is great.
I'm trying to give myself my own pedicures as I prepare for my upcoming wedding. I do know that my heels tend to peel periodically, so I bought something that would hopefully not only soften the feet as a whole, but keep them from peeling from now on. This thing does the trick.It smells absolutely lovely. It's a nice, light scent to me (though my fiance claims it's strong - but even he thinks it's very pleasant). It also has the added bonus of keeping the palms of my hands soft, too.
I bought this on a whim when my feet were aching one day.  It smells REALLY strong, and you can smell more plum and tea tree oil than peppermint.  It also doesn't tingle as much as a purely peppermint foot lotion, and it's not as thick as a regular one - so if you need a really intense moisture then look elsewhere.  But I have normal feet that are only normal feet dry, so this feels good - it really is soothing, and you can kind of feel the peppermint but definitely feel the tea tree oil.  And honestly the smell is nice - once it's on your feet and rubbed in it's not as strong.
I have worn contacts for many years now but my astigmatism is so high only a few manufacturers make them in my prescription.So disposables are out of the question.And regular saline just doesn't get enough of the gunk off my lenses. I usually wear them eight hours a day.I use Clear Care and it keeps my lenses nice and fresh all day.One word of warning, don't get any of the solution on your fingers then try to put your lenses in!!!Hydrogen peroxide in your eyes = OUCH!!!Still, a great way to extend the wear of your lenses if you can't wear disposables.
I love my Hoover Floor Mate.  I use it on my hard wood floors and find it cuts my floor cleaning time in half or more.  This baby vacuums, washes, scrubs, and dries the floor in just a few passes.  I find it invaluable and haven't touched a mop bucket since the first day I tried it.  The water collection cup is the perfect size to handle two large rooms so you're not emptying it constantly.  As much as I sweep, there is still way too much dog hair left on the floor.  My Floor-Mate saves me from having to vacuum before washing my floors and that saves lots of time..  If you have any hardwood or tile, be prepared to have some fun cleaning them for a change.
I simply can't live without this WONDER.I LOVE clean floors, and I could just not do it on my own. I have two cats, a three year old boy and a husband who is in construction.  I also have 1100 square feet of tile and wood floors..........I'd MOVE out if it weren't for my Hoover!  I clean every weekend, it probably takes me about two hours to do the whole house - I vacumn first, then go over it all again using the wet scrub - my floors SPARKEL (for about a day!)You've got to get one.....
I bought this a few years ago and was very excited about it when I purchased it.  It was only used a few times and now it collects dust.  I am not impressed with it.  As far as the sweeping feature goes, most vacuums can clean hard floors now.  So really it just mops for you and the amount of steps you have to do to get it to work and clean up after, doesn't make it worth it.  I also didn't feel like it did that great of a job of cleaning either.  It didn't live up to the hype.
I love my Floor Mate.  I have been wearing a walking boot on my foot for several weeks that left large black marks on my linoleum, and I haven't been able to mop or do any serious housework.  The Floor Mate off all those marks without breaking my back (or a sweat).  I had to empty the dirty resevoir 3 times, and now my floor is cleaner now than it's been in years!  The only improvement I could suggest is to put a light on the handle when you're in wet scrub mode.  I kept forgetting to switch when I wanted to scrub.  This is the best investment I've made in years.  I would encourge anyone who doesn't like housework or has back problems to try it.  It'll save your back and your time!
The only good thing about this cleaner is that the shipping was free.  The handle was a pain to assemble.  We have all tile floors and I was hoping for a cleaner that would do it all.  The thought into the product was good, but it doesn't work as advertised.  (I bought the delux model by the way).  After cleaning there were marks/streaks left by the solution the vacuum doens't pickup.  The little bit of solution it did pick up was obviously dirty, but when I had to wipe down the tile to get rid of the streaks, I found all kinds of more dirt coming off on the paper towel.  That tells me it left most of the dirt behind.I hate returning things, so I'll just give this to my step-son, who also has tile floors.I'll stick to the 14&quot; sponge mop and divided bucket.Peter
This worked great on cleaning my kitchen floor.  Dirt came up that I didn't know I had, and it was cleaner than the day I moved in.Everybody that says the floors are &quot;dull&quot; afterward, I totally agree.  But I think if they tweaked their cleaning solution, that could change.  Also, you really have to do run the unit slowly for the best effect.But I hate the clean up in the sink afterward.  To guard against mold, I have to dry the removable pieces for several hours afterward, which ties up my dish strainer.  I might start using the dishwasher for that.
I use my floor mate on vinyl kitchen flooring and I have to agree with the positive comments already given by the other reviewers.  I won't bore you all to tears by saying the same thing in some new way.  What I do want to mention is that I only give this thing 4.5 stars because the dry vacuum mode is not all that great.  If you have a few crumbs in the middle of your floor this will pick them up no problem.  If you have a few crumbs around your baseboard or in the corners (as many of us do), this thing will drive you mad as you try unsuccessfully to pull those crumbs.  Eventually I give up and sweep with a broom first and then use the scrub/wet vac settings to produce a very clean floor.  Its a small complaint but one I though worth mentioning.  If the vacuum power on this thing were a bit stronger, it would easily be 5+ stars!
I have ceramic tile floors, which means grout.  This machine doesn't clean the grout at all.  A neighbor has a newer model with a special attachment for grout that she says works pretty good.  So I tried finding this attachment on their website, hoping it would work on my older model, but no luck.  So now I'm really disappointed knowing there is a better model out there, but I've already invested in this one. That being said, I still prefer using it to doing it the old-fashioned way.
When the item came, the batteries were already dead.  I ran to the drugstore to buy new batteries, but the store didn't carry the correct kind.  Even if they did, we could not get the battery cover off.  It says to just use a coin, but we did that and all it did was strip the plastic.  Both my husband and I tried with various tools, but we couldn't open the battery cover.  We'll keep trying, but right now it's basically a big waste of money.
I've bought a couple of these to keep in different places.  The probe is a soft rubber that doesn't hurt in the mouth.  The display is huge and lights up brightly enough to read, but not so brightly that it hurts your eyes in the middle of the night.  It reads temperatures quickly and has matched what my other thermometer read when I've compared results.  The only possible complaint that I have is that the beeping is LOUD - there is no way to sneak this in and out of a kid's mouth without waking them.
Nair has been around forever, and there's a reason why. It's the best, and at a fair price.You do have to use a lot of the product, especially if using it on your chest and legs.There is a very strong chemical smell, but it's not a deal breaker. You also have to be careful. If you leave it on to long, you could get burned. Read the instructions on the bottle, test it on a small patch of hair, and you will be fine.Excellent for removing hair. I wouldn't use it on certain parts of my anatomy though.
I know some people say this may or may not work well. But for me it worked really well, I let the lotion sit on my skin for 10 minutes and found that to be a good time. Removes hair smoothly and painlessly. The smell of it is ok, but then again I just wash myself after I use it, just because. But overall great product but the tube runs out quicker than you think, so if you really want to be using this product a lot, I would suggest two or three bottles.
I tend to rate products on if they do what they say they will do. This product says it will remove hair from your chest, back and arms and it did. However I did experience bumps in some areas but they cleared up within a couple of hours. I found for best results to leave the product on for about 10 minutes before removing. Especially with thick hair. The only draw back was withing a couple of days I noticed hair starting to come back. But the product did what it said it would do.
i got this for ear hair I am from a body hair generation and like mine. Just for fun I wetted my hair with warm water and applied a thick liberal amount to both sides of my head as directed waited 15 minutes. It is warm and smells like a ladies permanent. I rinsed with warm water as directed but most of the hair was still there. As I toweled dried my head the hair came off in great rolls ( Pretty Messy ) but it all came off slick as a babies butt. My wife is just going to hate it and church should be interesting. Hey Im retired and old so for me this is fun.
I have purchased this in stores as well as Nair's depilatory cream for women because sometimes the men's version is cheaper but sometimes the women's version is on sale.  I have noticed no difference in the hair-removing capability between the two creams.  Both remove hair well in ten to twelve minutes.  For me, the hair does not grow back for three to five days.  The women's version does have a nicer smell (won't stick with you once you wash it off, but easier to tolerate while using it).  If the women's version happens to be cheaper at your store, I would just go ahead and get that.  It is basically the same product with different packaging.
I have very thick chest hair and when I shave it always makes me break out. I wasn't expecting this to work too well. But it really did. I applied a generous amount of cream, and let it sit for 15 minutes. After that 15 minutes I wiped it off (pressing down very firmly) with a rag. The hair just wiped off like it was dirt being removed with soap and water. Amazing stuff. Like I said, I always break out when I shave--I get ingrown hairs, pimples, etc. Didn't have any problems using this stuff though. It also is way better than shaving because typically I only shave in one direction, so if you feel the skin from the opposite direction it still feels very coarse. This totally removed the hair, so there was no coarseness at all. Pretty cool stuff. I recommend it.
After reading negative reviews about smell, cuts, acne etc., I still ordered one to try.Smell: Not strong at all.Strength:Not strong enough for my chest hair. It removed 75% of abdominal hair and a lot were not removed from root. They look like shaven. I left for 14 minutes and still it could not budge chest hair. Only around 10% hair removed from chest.Cuts/burns: None even after rubbing washcloth and pulling hair that was not removed.I used it directly to body hair without trimming. May be that prevented from the cream going all the way down to roots.Next time, I'll trim the hair and then use the cream for over 15 minutes.Hopefully, that'll get rid of chest hair better.
As reported for the Energizers I purchased at Amazon, I found these Duracell batteries at an online pharmacy called hocks which had them much cheaper and with my other items had no shipping or tax either. If you have only an order for a battery and will get stuck with shipping, then these prices might be OK, but if you order anything else over some limit ($75??), then the hocks place will ship free and if I remember right it was $1.69 for TWO of these batteries in one package! Can't beat that price.
bought these just to have back ups while I was waiting for my new charger and amazon prime batteries (rechargables) these batteries have a good charge and seem to be working fine for all my electronic needs, wanted to have rechargables though for my new xbox controller, so like I said these were just extras to free up my rechargables.  So my review is these are a good deal for the money and come with a good charge on my tester.  NOTE: the next size up of these gives you a lot more batteries for just a few more bucks, I found this out after my purchase but oh well needed them quick so I just ordered what I thought was the best deal then did more research.
I thought Duracells would last longer. Now I'm wondering if I have been duped by advertising, and I'm usually undupable. These Maxells last about 15-20% longer in my S3 camera with which I also take quite a few "videos." In an AM/FM radio, I'm getting six weeks using it two hours a day.I realize that everything's relative, but I've used Kodak, Maxell, Duracell, RayOVac, and generics. I'll stick with these, and the price is pretty good, too.
There are several different kinds of batteries that have all been either long-lasting, or just short on the wallet. Maxell though has been well-known for making some of the best electronic products for all consumers. This 20 pack of AA batteries works just as well. The batteries last a very long time, while not short-changing you on your wallet. It works very well in my remote controls for the DVD player, and the MP3 player. While there are other ones that are just about the name like Duracell and Energizer, Maxell delivers in the quality. I definitely recommend this for anyone who needs a well-stocked supply of batteries.Price: B+Convience: A 1/2-Overall: B+
There are medical studies for those with NO adrenals on how DHEA helps patients feel better. Since I fall in that category and my doctor wanted me to try it, I did and I have been using this brand all along.DHEA is a precursor hormone that converts to testosterone and estrogen. If you don't need either of those, you are only going to get greasy or acne from taking this supplement. It does not convert to cortisol. As I shortly had to have a full hyst after my adrenals were out, this replacement became more critical to me to maintain some androgen levels.The tablets can be a little powdery, but they are not huge so easy to swallow. I take them in the evening. I do not take them with food.
I just got this at the end of last week and started taking it along with three other supplements. So far I am not feeling hungry or bloated but I do not yet know if it is because of this one or the other three I am taking to help block fat, carbs and build lean muscle. I am a bit gassy at the end of the day but so far, so good.UPDATE:I had to stop taking this supplement because it was raising my blood pressure and making my heart beat too fast. Took a few weeks to return to normal after I quit taking it. The bottle does warn of these side effects and after researching further, I found this should NOT be taken long term and the side effects could be fatal so if you have ANY signs or symptoms of high blood pressure (especially diastolic) or fast heart beat, stop taking ASAP.
I recently moved back to blade shaving with a DE razor.  Anticipating needing a little skin care through the learning process I bought a tube of this at a local drug store.This product does what it's supposed very well to and doesn't try to compete with my cologne.  It has an immediate soothing effect on my freshly shaved skin and doesn't leave an oily finish, but simply dries gradually and protects my face for the rest of the day.At first I thought it was a little pricey for a 2.5oz tube, but it only takes a little dime-sized bit to cover my cheeks and under-chin area.  Compared to some of the boutique shaving balms, its a screaming bargain.
This shaving cream choice came from a recommendation from a reviewer of shaving creams for wet type electric shavers.  It has been the best of the many, many, gel and skin lotion types that I have tried over the years, and I wish I had known about it long before I read this recommendation.  I bought this from Amazon, but I have since noted that it is also available at my local CVS pharmacy store along with a different Neutrogena Men Skin Clearing Shave Cream that is featured for sensitive skin.
This might be the worst shaving product I have ever used. Normally I like to used a badger brush + Tabac soap, but due to new living conditions I am unable to travel with those items. I bought this hoping for it to be better than most other commercial gels/creams, but I was wrong. I think I would take a can of that Barbasol foam before I used this again. Beard needs to be incredibly short for this filmy soap to work. If you wait for than a day in between shaves, much tugging and pulling will occur.STAY AWAY!
I bought this based on the claim that it helps to prevent bumps, irritation, and ingrown hairs.  I've suffered with all of those throughout my adult life.  This product goes on nice and smooth and it isn't foamy or thick, which is fine with me.  It seems to form a nice barrier between the razor and skin, but in actuality it does not.  I still end up with several cuts and many ingrown hairs.  I gave this a good, thourough test by using 3 tubes over several months and trying it with different brands of razors.  I saw zero improvement in my complexion.  Also, as one reviewer already wrote, this cream does clog the razor very much and that is frustrating.I was really hopeful this product would help me more, but after 3 tubes I can say I won't be buying anymore.
I have been trying to like Neutrogena Men Skin Clearing Shave Cream. Really, I've tried as hard as I could. It's just that it doesn't really back up its claims. It hasn't helped to clear my skin at all. Furthermore, the fact that it's a non-foaming cream makes it excruciatingly difficult to spread completely across my face without having to use a ton. The directions say that using about a quarter-size amount is "all you need." Yet it provides little coverage -- and does not spread evenly enough to provide a comfortable shave. It also claims to provide exceptional razor glide but it does not. Razor glide if awful with this product.
I bought this for my husband after actually watching him use bacterial HAND SOAP for shaving one day?! I was appalled. No wonder his skin was so dry. UGH! Anyways, I promptly went out and found this stuff. We both use the Neutrogena rainbath and love it, so I know their products are gentle and yet clean. My husband happens to have sensitive yet oily skin, so this was perfect. He really likes it and is actually using it and not our hand soap anymore. Plus it has a nice subtle scent without being too perfumey or manly. Just smells clean! His skin doesn't look dry anymore either.
I love Cirus Magic's aerosol air freshner, so I bought their All Purpose Cleaner along with several other products from the Citrus Magic line.This stuff DOES NOT work! I was cleaning off a table with some dried pasta sauce and this cleaner did not even disolve/loosen the dried sauce at all. I had to scrape it off with a scouring pad.I don't understand the positive reviews. Perhaps people were only using it to wipe down counters with no stains, food, crud? This is the only expanation I can arrive at because this stuff does not break down dirt or food residue. It's basically useless aside from making your house smell good.The bottle is also poorly constructed. The trigger broke after the bottle fell off the counter. Maybe it's some kind of eco-friendly flimsy plastic, but it makes for a horrible cleaning-solution bottle.All-around waste of money.
Like many others, I want to make sure that fruits and vegetables end up being clean before feeding my family. For much of my life in the kitchen, I have cleaned the old-fashioned way, lots of water and lots of labor. I was pretty happy to hear about this product. And, indeed, it has been a net plus for our family.It does seem to speed up the process of cleaning. Nonetheless it is not a miracle product. Lots of old-fashioned work is needed for me--after using this product--to make me comfortable with preparinbg fruits and vegetables for consumption.So, a useful product, but not the be all and end all. Human inspection and fine tuning is still needed!
After watching a program on bacteria on fruits and veggies purchased at the market, I wanted to get something to help with the cleaning of veggies. Ths product has a citrus smell, and the veggies are not bright in my stir fry, not sure if I am doing something wrong, or if this is causing my veggies to turn a dark color.  I tried stir fry without it, and they appear to be a bright color, which I like in my stir fry, especially green veggies, when they are a bright color it is more appealing.  I will continue to use this, but probably will try a different product in the future.
As another reviewer in my area, he was from Loganville, stated he was having a hard time finding this product.  I too have had a difficult time even finding it now.  As a result, I have purchased the pack of 24 Blistex Complete Moisture Tubes.  I particularly like the fact that there is no waxy feel to it, no flavor, and no fragrance.  It just INSTANTLY makes my lips feel completely moist in the most desirable way.  I hope they never stop making this product.  When I couldn't find this one I bought another Blistex product called Simple and Sensitive which I find has a gritty and waxy feel but no flavor or fragrance.
When you use this it instantly makes your lips feel moist without feeling waxy like Chapstick. If your lips are a bit cracked it gives a somewhat stinging sensation after that, but it is very mild and not really painful. Within a half hour your lips get a smooth, slippery, dry, elastic feel to them. It is really strange, your lips feel dry but aren't cracking or anything like that. And then after several hours you need to reapply it, so it doesn't last as long as waxy feeling moisturizers.It works well if you can ignore the strange feel of your lips, but lost 1 star because of how short it lasts.
The Exergen temporal artery thermometer works as expected / intended. I will say that I had to &#34;practice&#34; a couple times to get the motion &#34;just right&#34; for the reading, but after that it's a piece of cake and easy to do / not forget.I would suggest practicing once or twice before you actually need it - or maybe you will be a natural first try :) it's really not that hard, I was simply not doing the motion exactly right.I would also take a quick look at the instructions because it will identify what ranges you can expect the temperatures to vary based on the method you take it.
This is an overpriced, unnecessary tool. I purchased it wanting to spare my child the hassle of rectal temperatures, however she screamed more when I rubbed this across her head than when I stuck the thermometer in her butt. Also, the accuracy of this product is very questionable. When I told my pediatrician that her temperature was normal on this, he told me I needed to get a rectal temperature. I got really irritated because I felt I wasted a bunch of money and he wanted me to buy another thermometer until I took the rectal temperature and it was a full degree off! No wonder.Spare yourself the hassle and just buy the $10 rectal thermometer and a bottle of lube. Your pediatrician isn't going to care about anything other than the rectal temperature anyway.
We bought this thermometer from a local store (WM) but it's the exact same model and we love how well it works.It's super easy and convenient to use and very accurate. We love this product so much I decided to write this review. We all know the feeling when worried about kids temperature and in the middle of many things how difficult it is to get a good reading late at night when the child is sick. This thermometer is the best, it gives instant results. If it had data logging with date time stamp and allowed uploading to a computer, it would be even better, but this thermometer is almost perfect. Thank you Exergen for making a fine product :-)
I asked a couple of nurses who work with children before investing in an expensive thermometer.  They didn't recommend the ear and underarm thermometers, because they can be inaccurate.  They said to go with a rectal thermometer or this one.  Since I plan to use it for the whole family, including myself, I chose this one.  It is accurate enough for a newborn as well as to use on yourself for natural family planning.I took my own temperature 10 times in a row and got a consistent reading all 10 times.  It is extremely easy to use and we've been very pleased with it.One funny point--as my baby grew older, she became fascinated with the blinking red light, which made it challenging to scan her forehead.  She kept turning her head to look at the light!
Before i used it in a true emergency, I decided to try it out. I got an accurate reading every time (well, AFTER I read the instructions). I was able to get an accurate reading on my self (although this was admittedly a little harder), on my 6 year old, and on my 3 year old. No problems if you slowly swipe across the middle of forhead to the side of the temple. I tested the temps against a traditional and ear thermometer and the forehead thermometer was spot on.In the case of a truly high fever I would probably take more traditional routes and always will have a back up, but for a quick check this worked perfectly!
I am *so* glad we got this thermometer!  We bought it before our son was born and he is now 9 months old.  It has been wonderful.  We are first-time parents and so we tend to want to check his temperature a lot, especially in the first few months.  This thermometer makes it so easy to do...just run it across their forehead.  It has been very accurate for us.  And now that my son is 9 months old he grins when we use it - he loves the beeps it makes!  I doubt he'd be so calm about it if we were taking his temperature another way... ;)Well worth the money!
I am speechless. After reading a lot of positive reviews and buying this thermometer, neither myself nor my spouse have been able to get a good reading. We both are educated people and have read the manual several times, tried to follow all the steps. One would think it should not be difficult to take the temperature reading. Each reading was different and never showed the right temperature for either my spouse or me! Tried to use it on a healthy baby....but he kept moving so I could not even hold the thing next to his forehead!!!I can't imagine using it on a sick baby who probably has no patience and totally cranky. I am shopping now for a thermometer that actually is easy to use
Simple and to the point, Ajax Powder Cleanser with Bleach is what my Grandmother and my Mother used. When they were cleaning the kitchen or the bathroom, your nose knew that some serious business was going on. Not that it was the most beautiful scent in the world, it just let you know, as you would soon see, that perfect results would be evident.The bathroom sparkled. The kitchen was shiny and new.With all the super-atomic-organic cleaners on the market today, isn't it funny I always feel compelled to return to old-faithful again and again?Somehow you just know... when you want it clean, you want it Ajax clean.
THIS PURCHASE WAS FOR A SPARE METER, I KEEP ONE HOME AND USE ONE FOR TRAVEL. WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THIS METER IS THAT THE TEST STRIPS ARE IN A DRUM THAT'S LOADED INTO THE METER. ONE LESS THING TO CARRY AROUND. NO NEED TO INSERT STRIPS FOR EACH TEST. THE STRIPS LOAD THEMSELVES AND STICK OUT THE BOTTOM WHEN POWERED ON. READY FOR APPLYING YOUR BLOOD SAMPLE. WHEN DONE, AT POWER OFF, THE TEST STRIP DROPS OUT THE BOTTOM. YOU NEVER HANDLE THE STRIPS . THAT'S WHY I WENT WITH THIS METER. IT'S SO EASY TO USE, I'VE EVEN USED IT WHILE STUCK IN TRAFFIC.
I did a personal comparison of meters including Nova Max, Trueresult, Freestyle lite, Contour, One Touch ultra mini, Accu-chek, Embrace talking meter, Relion Prime, and Prodigy talking. My test was for 10 days and I took blood once a day for each meter (all tests were in the morning - fasting). I saw a lot of difference in the readings and judged my results from ease of use, price, result continuality, Of these meters the Accu-chek was just an average meter. The numbers seamed to fluctuate less that the other meters. The cost of the test strips are on the higher end. This test was done on my own so it was not done in a laboratory so my results are not scientific just my honest opinion.
This meter is surely among the easiest to use!  It holds a drum of 17 strips internally which means it's quick to start a test. Once the drum is exhausted, changing is quick and easy.This newer design has a back-lit display for easy reading. Also, and perhaps even better, the door to the drum storage compartment is hinged to the meter and doesn't need to be rubber-banded in place like my old one.The only problem I found is the door is hard to open when new. To fix that I used a toothpick to apply a tiny dab of silicone grease to the latch and now it opens smoothly.
I bought this for my dad along with extra lancets and a 51 pack test strip pack. I havent had him use it yet, but I researched a lot online about glucometers and this seems like the best one available with easy to use features. It comes with a great looking classy carrying case in which one can store the lancets, softclix device, the meter, the solution and the test strip drum. It comes with a 17 test strip drum, a softclix device, ten lancets, carrying case, solution and complete manuals.
The item was described as preloaded with 17 strip drum and there is none. Lancets and clear cap for testing on different area of the body are missing, too.  For some reason I cannot return it even though I cannot possibly use it.  The package wasn't sealed and the box is dirty and, obviously, the device was used before.I sent an email to Amazon..hopefully they'll ban this seller of tricking people.Amazon has refunded me.  I disposed the item and I wrote on the box "BAD" such as nobody else to be able to resell it.  I bought a Bayer Contour from Walgreens.  Bayer offers free strips upon registration.  Practically, the glucometer is free.
Twenty years of being a diabetic means I have gone through a number of meters.  For a long time One Touch was my preferred meter.  It has a lot of bells and whistles.  Then I started paying attention to what Diabetes Forecast has to say about Accu-Chek meters and decided to try it.  I am so happy that I did as it meets my needs remarkably well.  Sure, it doesn't have all the features of some other meters but it is reliable, simple to use and easy to transport.  The blood sample needed is small enough that I don't mind the finger pricks too much.  It gives me enough past readings to stay attentive to my recent glucose level patterns.  And, everything I have read indicates that it is perhaps the most accurate meter available to consumers at present.  I wont be switching soon.
Works great for what I needed to do with it.  I don't have diabetes but I still needed to keep tabs on my blood sugar levels.  It fast, painless and I love that it can be used on more areas then just the finger.  I did not like it on the palm as it does actually hurt.  I use it on the back of my calf and I sometimes can't even tell it has stuck me.  I also like how the strips are in a drum and you don't have to insert and new one every time.  The downside is that they are very pricey.  $50 to $60 in store and still $20 + on Amazon most of the time.  Would recommend.
I used Supersmile for a couple of months.  I was delighted with my new smile--brighter and whiter, without that unnaturally bleached look.  Fine.  I was a bit worried about Supersmile's efficacy as a toothpaste, but my teeth looked great.Then I discovered the Crest 3D line.  Wow.  Not only did 3D whiten my teeth beyond Supersmile, I trust Crest for dental hygiene.  The Supersmile is cosmetic, the Crest is great toothpaste.  I kept the Supersmile I already has for emergencies, but I'm sold on Crest 3D.  And it's way less expensive than Supersmile.  Win all around!Just for the record, I used Supersmile a couple of years before Crest came out with the 3D.  My dentist  never commented on any problems nor did I develop any cavities.  I am not connected with Crest, its parent company or any affiliates, either
This toothpaste was recommended to me by my cosmetic dentist as the only shot to re-whiten my veneers -- and BOY does it.  I could see a difference in only a few days and then, after a few months, they were as white as the day I got them.  My whole family and a lot of friends now use this with great results.  None of us have any gum irritation or problems and another bonus is that nothing we've ever used leaves your teeth/mouth feeling so absolutely clean. It's pricey for "toothpaste" but worth every penny. Thank you Dr. Smigel you're a genius for inventing this!
It seemed many of the reviews here are negative.  However, it's served me well so far(knock on wood.)  I purchased this for my aging mother & she has used it everyday for 2+months, about 30 minutes each use.  She uses it as part of her therapy.The lowest setting seems a bit useless & the highest seems warm enough.  However, I do believe the level of warm is highly subjective.  Not being the first Homedics product I have owned, I also feel that their their manufacturers' quality control vary greatly.For myself, I consider this purchase to be well worth it & I do believe that given the nature of this product, it will not last forever.If you do chose to try this product out, I hope you end up with a good one too.  *fingers crossed*
Love this stuff, it is the best lubricant I have ever used.  It is great for all areas that need a little lubricant.  Lasts a long long time and only a few drops will do the job (unless its a marathon session).  Slick and slippery without the sticky mess you get from water soluble lubes.  This is silicone and its the best.  A little more money up front, but will last much longer than anything else so the value is outstanding.  Pay the money and you'll see that its worth its weight in gold.
I had a near-sighted Mohican barber named Quepeg in Syracuse NY usually shave my head with an old fashioned razor axe. Perfect. He eventually retired so I had to look for something else.I used this primarily for shaving my head, as it gives no room for fleas, ticks, protezoa, or miotianta to live in your hair. Hair is also a great fertilizer for Barbary plants so I was conducive to ecological demands placed upon me by my hippy girlfriend who is bald. I have a year's supply of Baby oil too, so I need to use it up with my bald head.That said, I cut myself to pieces each time I used it. I looked like a bloody head stump from a horror movie plus I got dizzy looking at the reverse angle in the mirror every time I tried to shave.Now I just settle for the electric buzzer, which leaves a bit of hair but it's safer, unless you do it while in the shower or in a lighting storm.

I bought this at CVS about 5 years ago after seeing it featured on a TV show.  Someone reminded me of it recently, so I decided to share my experience.  I've been using a Mach 3 razor for many years to shave my head, and I think it works just fine.  I tried this thing, and immediately noticed that there was no easy way to tap the hair out of it.  It got clogged with hair and there was no leverage to tap the hair out like there was with a normal shaped razor like the Mach 3.  It just got clogged up.  I returned it to CVS.  Useless compared to the Mach 3.  End of story.
We purchased one of these when my wife got braces on her teeth.  It has proven ideal for keeping her teeth and braces free of food particles.It is slightly noisy (bear that in mind if you are using it early in the AM while your spouse and kids are sleeping!), and is quite compact.  One complaint that I have is the hose - which curls tightly and sometimes caused the cleaner to twist in my hands - but this is not a big dealThe water resevoir is sized nicely, so that I have just enough water to finish a session.The tongue cleaning device works quite well.  You are given several different heads, so the whole family can use the unit, and have their own waterpik.Highly recommended!
To be very honest, I only post negative experiences with products since it is my belief that when one purchases a product good quality should be a given. I own TWO of these units, which are model WP-65W, essentially the very same unit as the 60W. All of the negative issues already posted, such as the motor seizing, have been experienced by me. I am posting this review because China has come to earn a very negative reputation for producing inferior quality, just read the newspapers. On the other hand, WATERPIK is responsible for the specifications on these products. I use these units because I have gum disease and daily use helps me. There seems not to be much of a choice in the marketplace just now.
I don't know about you, but my dentist charges $35 a minute for his fillings.  For the same price, you will get two years from a device which, no matter how hard you brush, will kick surprising amounts of crud from between your teeth, can be filled with mouthwash to kill halitosis sources from between your teeth, virtually stops gum bleeding (me) with use 3x a week, and (bonus) can clean industrial parts quite well!  Sure, its 89 decibals, vibrates like a banshee and squirts all over the bathroom (until you become expert), but let's not quibble!  There is no substitute.
As another reviewer pointed out, potential flooding and definite noise have to be dealt with, but it's not too difficult to learn the tricks needed to keep water going where you want it.  My current one, several years old, has finally burst the water feeder coil, and has a lot of miles on it, so I dropped in to get a new one.I'm hooked on my Pik, despite its flaws, because it really finishes up a teeth cleaning job.  I have some pockets along my gum line that flossing and my Sonicare (which I love) just don't clean well enough, making for some nasty breath and potential greater problems, but the Water Pik takes no prisoners.  Gunk is gone!The Pik also gives the gums a great massage, and when I'm done, I know I've done everything possible to keep my teeth happy and firmly connected to the rest of me.
The WP-60 has proven very satisfactory - easy to use; easy to clean; very effective.  The only important item missing from this product is the sub-gingival tip, which apparently can only be purchased in sets of two.  The regular & tongue cleaning tip are excellent.  If you use soap as I do, remember to rinse it out after every use.  Otherwise you will collect junk in the tubing, tip and pump.  Same if you have hard water - protect your investment by running a soft water rinse.  Remember that you can force water under the gum if you have soft gums and the force is set high.  Start low - your gums will harden up from the pounding of the jet.
I have a Homedics SBM-300 Shiatsu Massage Cushion that does a nice job--as far as it goes.  It just doesn't quite rise to the occasion sufficiently to hit those tired shoulder, neck, and head areas.  That's where this Homedics Percussion Massager comes into play.  I can enjoy the shiatsu massage and simultaneously dangle this convenient, adjustable portable unit on the  back of my neck.  Formerly I had an identically configured Brookstone model at nearly three times the price and weight.  Maybe a good unit for twosomes, but when I tried to use it solo, my tired, blood-drained arm began to howl in protest.  This Homedics unit is heavy enough to maintain its position on the spine by gravity alone but not so heavy as to require a "second," or assistant (my cat is certainly of little help).  It's a happy medium that hits the spot on top.
I have searched and searched and searched.......and FINALLY got me this one~! First impression was....CHEAP MADE LOOPKING. MADE IN USA? but when I turn it on, well, it worked as I expected. Very nice massager for its price, it comes with three adjustment caps for SOFT, MEDIUM, and HARD. I wish there were case/place where I can store these caps which were not in use. If you are not careful you could hardly loose them~!!! Also, I thought the machine was HEAVY. If  you are doing it on to yourself, you may get tired of just holding it....(I am a men, wiegh 200lb, 6'2, work out every day). and I thought this machine was heavy to hold for more than 1 min. massage on to your self. So, I give 3 stars.
I love to have a massager at home to relieve any pain (or cramp) at any given moment.  That's why I bought the HoMedics PA-100. I love it, and as a matter of fact, I bought a second one for my daughter.  My only problem is that it's a little too big and heavy for me to use it on myself. My arms really get tired if I use it for too long on my back.  My daughter instead, has her husband to help her with, and she tells me she feels in heavens every time she uses it.  So, go for it!  It beats the price you pay for just one professional massage at the Spa.
Gentlemen, let me give you a some free information. The average woman is a little shorter than the average man (about 6 inches I have read), so that means that all too often we find ourselves looking up your noses. And, if there is one thing that turns many of us off, it is the sight of all sorts of hair streaming out of your nostrils! (How do some of you guys breathe?)Anyway, I highly recommend this excellent groomer, which does an excellent job of getting rid of that unsightly nose and ear hair. It doesn't pinch or pull, and is very easy to use. I got one for the guy in my life about a year ago, and am very happy with the results. Take my advice, gentlemen, and get grooming!(Review of Panasonic ER411NC Nose and Ear Hair Groomer)
2 Stars is generous but I gave it 3.  Pros: Looks nice, is comfortable in the hand, battery life is good, never pinches and is relatively quiet.  Con's :(the reasons you want a nose trimmer are not solved. It misses many nose and ear  hairs as they do not seem to be directed into the slots easily and takes much time since it misses so many and doesn't cut them short enough (it is why there is no pinch).  You can hear it working as it slows the blades, but you look and still see the ones missed. Frustrating!  Seems like there has got to be an efficient model that is powered.  I may end up with the well rated manual model. I feel it is not worth the money and there is a good chance of disappointment.
I have a previous Panasonic nose trimmer model which I purchased over 8 years ago.  I use it often, as I find excessive nose hair offensive.  Although my old model works very well, I ordered this model over 1 year ago to have a spare in my hygiene kit, as I am often on the go with very little advanced notice.  Although both models trim nose hair excellently, his model, Panasonic ER411, is more powerful than my previous model, trims faster, and finishes the job in less time.  The end result is, however, the same for both; an excellent trim.  This new model, ER411, is just as easy to take apart and clean, as the old model.  One improvement, besides a more powerful motor, is that the cap has vents that allow for air drying with the cap on, and the cap will also prevent the trimmer to inadvertently turn "ON" via an innovative locking mechanism.
I bought this for my husband, and his first statement was that he didn't know why anyone would say it hurts.  Now, I haven't used it myself (and probably won't since it's been in his nose...), but he did say as long as you're not jamming it up your nose, he can't see how it would hurt.With that said, this product did its job and did it well.  He's pleased, and with that, I'd say it's a recommended item.
Like most of the other reviewers, I'm very happy with mine too.  I just wanted to add that it is almost impossible to screw up with this model. The blade is well positioned and protected enough that, excuse my French, you pretty much can just stick it in your ear or nose, twirl a bit, and presto!  The only exception to this IMHO is cutting nose hairs so short that my nose feels 'raw' for a bit....so just don't...stick...it...in....so....far.  :-)
I have had a previous model panasonic trimmer, but it gave up the ghost and I had to replace it.  So I went with another Panasonic.My old Panasonic didn't hurt.  Its blades were configured to hit the hairs at a more right angle, cutting cleanly and quickly.  Hairs could only enter the cutting zone of the head on the SIDES of the cutter, not on the tip.This (reviewed) unit allows hairs to enter the END of the cutter, where they are TWISTED out of your skin.  It hurts like crazy - and I'm highly pain tolerant.  I think they must have done it to make the tip smaller.  But it's a totally ineffective compromise.  It made my eyes water and started an insane sneezing fit.  Entertaining for my wife, yes, but this thing is no good.  Not even worth returning - this is hitting the trash can.
Let's face it, men of a certain age start to find the need for regular mowing of bits of our faces that previously needed none.The problem is the prospect of sticking conventional trimming devices up ones nose or down ones ears, ranks anywhere between terrifying and psychotic! Scissors up the nose? no way and the prospect of tweezing, jeeeeesh!!Then I found this, a buzzy little friend with a delicate head and no visible blades nor any which could harm skin but get them near tufty and furry facial cavities and they are back to their hairless days in no time. With this I can trim in minutes and no longer have to fear looking like a scarry guy who is going mouldy. One tip I would offer, after trimming your nose hairs thoroughly, blow your nose well to do what your barber does with the old neck brush!
This will shave all nose/ear hair. Wet/Dry and waterproof, completely portable, there is nothing not to like.  It does everything it should with no errors.  Hard to imagine this product any better.Edit:The above is my original review.  One year later, it is broken.  I have since switched to the Grommmate stainless steel and manual trimmer, which is cheaper and just as effective, albeit slower; it is also less likely to break.In short:  this device works great, until... it stops working.
I was totally satasfied with this item.  Simple, straight forward and easy to use.  I didnt have any of the "pulling" problems other reviewers had either.  Just a bit of a tickle while it was trimming.I used this about once a week, just to keep everyting under control, for about 4-5 weeks.  Then it just stopped working, wont work no matter what I do.  And yes, I did try new battereies.For the price this is a great item, if it would have lasted more than 4-5 uses.  I think I will buy a nicer one next time and hope it lasts a little longer.
Most reviewers on this site are unenthusiastic about this particular product.  I think the main reason for that level of dissatisfaction is, as someone else suggested, that people need to pay attention to how, exactly, this trimmer works.  Because of its design, best results are obtained when it is inserted, withdrawn, then inserted again, and the procedure repeated.  Second tip: rinse the rotating blade, switched ON, under the HOT tap to remove accumulated hair, etc, after each use.  It works better when clean.The main PLUS of this product is its size.  Yes, it is flimsy, made in China, and would probably sell for $2.50 if it didn't say Panasonic on it - or come with a 12-month Panasonic warranty.  But it works very well if you use it right and keep it clean. I have had mine a couple of years and the only problem is that the blade is now dull and replacement blades are apparently not available.
I've tried a lot of different nose/ear trimmer even the lighted Panasonic ER421KC trimmer. That one rips your hair out and runs out of batteries quickly. I did like the trimmers that they show on TV that have a little trimmer on one side but those get disgusting after using them for a while even if you wash them off and they bog down easily. I got fed up and bought this and I was VERY pleased. It is fast and powerful. They use to make a water proof version but I cant find it. Try this one you won't regret it.
I don't know why this is getting so many bad reviews. I've had this for about 5 years and it works well. It takes some getting used to, but it works. You need a little experience and need to play around with it a little, but you'll get the hang of it. The battery will work for at least 50 trims (has for me). For those who dropped and broke it, I think that's less the fault of the device than the person. Most of all, it's cheap! I used to use nail scissors to cut my hairs, but now I just use this. It's quick and easy. I even use this to trim ear hair and eyebrows now.
A nose trimmer is not a complicated piece of machinery, but is a necessary one.  Using clippers or scissors just doesn't make it and you risk infection.  This device has tiny surgical stainless-steel blades and runs fast and smooth.  No pinching and no discomfort.  It is a bit touchy to clean as the central shaft and blades once out rather easily for cleaning under tap water.  I could easily see losing a piece down the drain.  But for a small, lightweight and packable `nose and ear' trimmer, it does the job and it's not that expensive.  I'll be the first to admit that nose trimmers are not sexy, but neither are nose hairs!Battery not included.  Also, when I first got my trimmer, the ON/OFF button wouldn't turn off.  I returned it and was given a new one within a week.
When it worked, this compact trimmer did a good job.  Unfortunately the motor died after a few months.  The trimmer first developed problems with starting, where it would take a few taps on the housing to get the motor going.  Performance deteriorated until it finally refused to start at all.  The motor reminds me of the cheap DC motors used in model planes, that fail after minimal use.  Maybe I got a lemon, but this trimmer was a total disappointment.  It is cheap, so if it does die, at least you won't lose too much.
Results of this product vary depending on how severe your condition is.  If you are really constipated, prepared to be in pain with cramping.  I took this product when I was experiencing bloating and the full feeling and the next morning I was miserable.  I kept feeling like I was going to faint and I had moderate pain and cramping in my gut.  It relieved the constipation, but at what price?  Other times, I have taken it and only experienced runny stools, but anytime you take it, it does cause cramping.  I prefer milk of magnesia instead.
This is a STIMULANT laxative.  Of course it is going to cause you pain!!!  This is the same drug prescribed by surgeons when they want an empty bowel. Yes it will give you cramps because it is stimulating and literally squeezing everything out!Pure dulcolax laxative is very strong and always has been. If you really really need to make sure you can evacuate, this IS the drug for you. Gentle is really misleading however.If you want less suffering, try a laxative that says stool softener. But don't blame the drug itself, it is only doing what it is intended to do.If there were reviews for chemotherapy people would give only one star. Of course it will make your hair fall out and make you nauseated and sick as never before. But that is what it does. Do your research before buying something.Yes, this will cause a bowel movement and you will feel like someone is punching you in the stomach.
My eye doctor recommended I caps a few years ago and, to be honest, I forgot all about the recommendation until I recently asked my physician what he felt the best multi-vitamin was. ( I just turned 43; it seemed a relevant question to revisit!)  Because these not only contain all the other vitamins one would want in a multi, but also contain the necessary ingredients to help prevent macular degeneration, apparently, this one was once again the pick. Because of that, and because both of my doctors have no association, it has been my vitamin of choice.My mother actually had some kind of corneal surgery and now takes these as well...seems to be a well rounded vitamin with even some ingredients that not all multiples have, such as Chromium.I like that the focus is not only on the healthy body, but vision as well...equally as important.
My grandmother has Macular Degeneration.  Her ophthalmologist recommended that she take these vitamins (this formula only). One important note:  the 'servings size' is two per day; So a bottle of 60 will only last one month.  One great thing is that you can have amazon ship this to you automatically every month!  It is perfect for someone who has a difficult time getting to the store, and the price is good (cheaper than at a drug store).  I started taking one per day in hopes to prevent the same illness that my grandmother is suffering from.
The front of the bottle has in orange "Lutein and Zeaxanthin" to catch your attention, but this is deceptive marketing because one cap only has 2 mg of Lutein and Zeaxanthin. No, that's not even 2 mg of each; it is 2mg of the two blended together!I bought these for my mom and also tried them myself. They are useless. Buy something else that is more honest and actually delivers. You want something with 6-20 mg of lutein. Icaps are expensive, dishonest, a scam, and useless. Unfortunately, they are probably the most widely available eye supplements.
I have been seeing an eye Dr and she wanted me on an eye formula vitamin.  I don't know if it's making a difference.  I have been on it 3 months.  I had an eye visit last week and my eyes have improved!  Good news.  I would like to say it was because of this formula but I don't really know.  I have nothing bad to say about this one.  I take it 2 times a day.  It doesn't upset my stomach.
the only reason i don't give 5 stars is because of the PAIN. epilating is pain, i don't care what brand you use. if you keep up with it and use it often, it is a little less painful, but it still hurts.i don't use the shaver part, it doesn't shave close enough for my liking.i love to use this for my armpits, it leaves them smooth and hair free for a few days or more. i find it hurts less if i take off the spike wheel attachement, but that's just me. it's small and easy to take with you.
This is an excellent quality device, it keeps your legs smooth and hairless, is easy to use and is much cheaper than the amount of money that you will need to spend if you use razors. I have used these for many years, I am used to the feeling and this does not cause any pain. There are 2 plastic "protectors" that come with the device, they prevent the device from getting too close to your skin. I tried to epilate with the protector in place, but it did not work that well. When I epilated without any protector at all, the epilation was far more successful. It is nice not having to deal with razor blade cuts on my legs. This epilator also epilates the rough skin from your legs and the result is smooth and hairless legs. Recommended!
This product works very well for removing hair everywhere I have tried, but it does take some getting used. The pain I experienced when I first started using this was bad enough that I did not want to try again. A few weeks later I did, and it was not nearly as painful. I do not think my hair is growing back slower-but it is growing back thinner and some follicles are not growing back at all.It is also not a quick process. The first time I used it-it took about an hour to do my legs, arms, and bikini area. On my second try, it took about half as much time. It can be difficult to get some of the smaller hairs-but I take off the safe guard/massage guard and am able to get a few more.My best advice is to tough out the pain and do a little bit at a time.
I've used a Braun Epilator before and meant to purchase this one before but was given the wrong one as a gift. This one totally kicks arse over my previous one I had to leave in Australia when I moved to the US.  My legs are really sensitive and the little prongs on this one take away the pain where as the previous prongs were more for show - well detract from the pain as I haven't used an epilator in 6 months - double ouch! I have no problem with bikini but getting back into the underarm groove is a bit painful - OUCH!!My only whinge is this one didn't come with a little pouch to put everything away in which I thought was standard.I LOVE this epilator and if you can stand the pain for a wee while you do get used to it... Deep breathing helps at times!!!
BUY ONE OF THESE!!! THE BEST $40 I HAVE SPENT IN YEARS!!!I have owned 2 other epilators in the past incl the old epilady int he early 1990's. This epilator is amazing! I have large areas of my legs where no hair grows from the old style epilady I owed. It took me hours back then and it was painful. This new Braun is so good the pain is only slight, and diminishes in just a few minutes after starting to use it. I even used it on my bikini line and was very impressed that there was no pain AND it worked on short stubble.
I gave this razor two stars because it does work sort of. However, I bought it because there were reviews from women who said it was better than the Venus. I had the VenusGillette for Women Venus Divine Razorand thought somehow the Mach would be better. But it feels awful in my hands. I know that sounds ridiculous as it's just a razor, but the Venus does feel a lot less slippery and just more viscerally pleasant and easier to hold. I felt like I could cut myself easier with the Mach. It just felt creepy to me. I gave it to my husband.
I have a heavy dark beard and I need to shave every day. These turbo blades combined with a good shaving gel last me around 2-3 months before I HAVE to replace it. Now after a couple of weeks they don't shave as effortlessly as fresh out of the box but I am a frugal person and don't like to waste money. The important thing to me is that if I shave in the morning I don't want a shadow in the evening. These blades do that. I often go the weekend without shaving so on Monday the blade has alot of work to do and after 2-3 months it can still handle it. With this schedule this shaving system isn't expensive at all-less than $1/month.
Funny because I had a mach 3 for a long time, and I love it to death.I decided to go ahead and try the new razor. I bought this from Walmart. Very strange, indeed. This has never happened before. Is the Mach 3 supposed to be dull for a faster shape? maybe they used dull blades so people can shave fast without cuts? Or I just got a bad package.I decided to go ahead and do this review for amazon because I saw there were a lot of reports of dull blades upon purchase. I just want to let people know that I was one of them, but mine are definitely real. It seems possible that Gillette may be letting go of some of their quality.Sorry all but the blades suck. Just because you didn't think so, doesn't mean mine weren't dull. This is a crappy A razor. You can go you know what.
I bought this from Amazon because I lost my years-old shaver and still had replacement blades left.  I've also got the Gillette Fusion 5-blade shaver, and I definitely prefer 3 blades, especially for travel.  Both yield a nice shave, however the 3 blades are slightly heavier than the 5 blades, and therefore tend to get bent less when inside my luggage when other stuff presses against them.  I also have a slight preference for the straighter handle on the Mach 3 vs. the fusion.  Having the no-slip grip is fine with me, and a more cylindrical handle for me makes it easier to control the shaver through all the different angles and directions it takes to shave a face.
It is a great razor, but the blades are expensive.  I love this razor and I have tried others to save money.  But I always come back.  The blades do last, but a fresh razor is always best.  I use the blades as long as possible and change them for dates and important events.  You can get away with about 25 shaves, but for the closest shave, change after a week of use. The best results are usually the first 4 shaves.  I just place the older blades in the case and reuse them for weekend and normal work days. I have gone up to 30 days with one razor.  Try and buy the blades in bulk and on sale.  Amazon had a great sale once, 25% off and free shipping.  That helps reduce the cost.
I purchase blades at Costco in multi packs. Got my first handle years ago as a freebie in the mail. I guess they were trying to hook me on their blades like some sort of drug dealer. It worked! The original finally is starting to show its age so I  needed another. And 3 blades is more than enough to do what I need. The 4 blade razors are a bit to big for my upper lip and don't seem to  provide any particular benefit other than &#34;more is better&#34;, sort of how the V8 engine came into being. But that is another story. This is a great product at a fair price.
After trying disposables and electric razors, I've used the Gillette Mach3 Turbo Razor for several years. This razor gives a clean smooth shave and the cartridges usually last for a couple weeks without replacement. People who have heavier beards may receive fewer shaves from each cartridge. With it's pivoting head, I've noticed that it takes less effort to get a smooth shave underneath the nose and chin with this razor, areas that are typically hard to reach for me without getting nicked. The cartridges are easy to replace and don't generally clog when using a foam shaving cream, but they can clog when using a gel. The cartridges usually clean up very easily when rinsed often with hot water and I've received very few nicks with these razors. Overall.. a great shave.Please rate this review if you found it helpful.
Comparing multi-blade razors, Mach III is best: By far the easiest to clean, best balanced, and the most securely attached handle-to-head. These things -matter-, the shaves are otherwise fairly equal.  IF YOU MUST: I used double-edge 'safety' razors for years, before there -were- cartridges. If you have a tough hide, or are master barber, fine, but regular guys continue get cut on a regular basis with the old style. Mach III will shave you just as close, you will never get cut.
OK, so I've tried a lot of energy bars and these are certainly my favorite.  They have a nice mix of nutrition and good taste.  They honestly taste almost like a candy bar, they are pretty sweet but that's a good thing in my opinion!  I just wanted to write a review to say I love this product.That being said, I have not ordered them online because I can get them for the same price locally, but if I lived out in the sticks I'd probably order these online because I have to have them!  I eat 1 a day, it's the perfect snack between meals.
I sell my knitted products at markets that vary from 3 to 6 hours in length.  During that time, I usually sit and knit while I wait for customers.  This used to be a major problem, as prolonged sitting would aggravate the arthritis in my sacroiliac joints, and getting up would be difficult on the knees.  This wedge does not collapse when I sit on it.  It maintains me at just enough height that I can get up and down without knee strain.  My back is much more comfortable when I sit for extended times, too.  This was such an economical fix for some very painful problems!
I have degenerative disc disease with back pain and spasms; so when I buy pillows or cushions I am looking for something to give good, strong support, and this pillow offered a cushioned seat with cut-out to allow the spine to elongate to prevent pain.  I also bought the pillow because it is portable and I intended to take it everywhere and use it when no other comfortable seating was available.  However, I was greatly disappointed in this product.  It does not keep a cushion and the pillow flattens out so you don't feel like you're sitting on a pillow at all.  I gave it 2 stars because of the cut-out for the spine but all-in-all, the pillow was a let-down.  No support whatsoever!  Very disappointing.  I would not recommend.
I use mine in an LED booklight for my Kindle (AAA) and in the Wii Mote for the kids (AA). I've only used the AAA about 5 times and each time they hold the charge less and less. Last night I put 3 freshly charged AAA in myBelkin Clip-On Reading Light for Kindle (White) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging] and it didn't even go THREE HOURS until it dimmed to where I couldn't see. Unbelievable.I can get cheap AAA batteries at the dollar store - and they at least LAST. I've had better luck with the Energizer rechargable AA batteries lasting a bit longer and holding a charge a bit more but these AAA ones are just the ultimate in craptastic.Save your money. Chose a different brand!
In this day and age it is hard to understand why everyone isn't using rechargeable batteries. I own 2 packs of these batteries. They are wonderful. I have saved a lot of money by ourchasing these. Why pay $4.00 to $5.00 for one pack of batteries that get used once and thrown away when you can purchase these and reuse them 1000 times. I absolutely refuse to by disposable batteries for the most part. It is true that they don't quite have the power of normal energizer alkaline batteries so they might be an issue for certain things that use a lot of power. For example Digital Camera's take a lot of power. But for the most part these work really well and I have used them for 3 - 4 years now. I highly recommend them to everyone.
I got these for my wife who listens to AM radio on her portable Sony radio while commuting on the bus and train, 5 days a week.  She would run through a ton of regular alkaline AAA batteries so rechargeables made sense.She has a pair of the Energizer's and a pair of Duracell's that are of the same capacity and she says that the Energizer's are terrible and hardly hold a charge.  We use a MAHA MH-C401FS charger which charges each battery independently so they don't get overcharged.  What else can you say about rechargeables?  Either they last long or they don't.  These Energizer's DO NOT.  We recently got a pair of Sony AAA's and they seem to be even better than the Duracell's.
December 27 2012  at  4-12-18 PMStay away from this brand, i bought their charger about 5 month ago, still working fine, but their batteries are ---HORRIBLE --- after about at the most 10 times of recharging start to break down, and the charger started to blink " a sign that one of the batteries being charged is defective ", 2 of them in about 3 month now. I did warn you stay away from their batteries, and when I called the customer service instead of telling me we they will send me another one, she said send to us and they will run diagnostics on it, to decide, I came to Amazon and started buying Sanyo instead,
First off, I would like to say that these batteries can NOT be used in the 15-minute chargers. You'll have to use the 8.5-9 hour chargers in order to charge them up to full capacity. I did some testing with my own charger and the 15 minute speed charger. The batteries worked great with the 9 hour charger, but very poorly with the 15 minute charger.Additionally, the voltage for these are 1.2v. Note that most non rechargeable AAA's are 1.5V, so you will be getting a lower voltage input. This is especially important for those who are using them for flashlights (reduced brightness) and those who are looking for a good 12V equivalent input for DIY projects (8x1.5=12V as opposed to 10*1.2v=12V, you would need 10 batteries as opposed to 8 in order to achieve a 12V input, for example)Regardless, these batteries, when treated right and if you know what they're best for are a very good deal.
I use a digital voice recorder a lot.  I was going through AAA batteries like jelly beans at a kid's picnic.  I decided to try the rechargeable AAA, and I'm glad I switched.I never thought it was possible, but these batteries perform better than the name-brand alkaline batteries I was using!  The digital voice recorder is limited to recording length by the charge in the battery.  I was getting about 20 hours on a pair of alkaline.  I just got 29 hours on these rechargeable batteries.They charge quickly and seem to hold a charge well.  I have started using these batteries in things like remotes, camera flash units, video lights, flashlights and more.I couldn't be more satisfied.  These are great and a great value, both in the short-term and the long.
Got these for my husband.  He has perfectly aligned teeth (naturally) and has never had a cavity.  However, we were starting to call his teeth his "pearly yellows."  I guess he drinks too much espresso.Anyhow, we bought the classic strips because of the lower level of peroxide - he is sensitive to stronger amounts (it makes his gums hurt).  Within the first 2 days we saw his teeth starting to look brighter, but not really whiter.  It wasn't until around the 5th day that we could say, "wow" - this stuff is really working.  He didn't even need the full 2 weeks - his teeth are quite white now.  He uses the remaining strips once per week to maintain the whiteness.
my teeth hurt so bad after i used this stuff.  i couldn't even finish using the whole thing, the searing tooth pain was awful!!!!  it was horrible pain i never want to feel again. and my teeth were only a tiny  bit whiter, if anything.  actually they might not have been whiter at all, i think i imagined it. might work for some people w/out a problem but if you have sensitive teeth, cavities or gum disease expect some PAIN. the peroxide really gets in there & chews up the nerves. ouch!
This is a poorly designed product.  Once the strips are in your mouth, not only can you not eat, drink, or speak--you cannot even move your tongue!  If it bumps the strip, the strip crinkles, and soon you only have a balled-up piece of plastic stuck to one tooth.  I used over half the box, and only one time did they stay secured the full half hour they are supposed.  Were my teeth whiter?  No.  They just caught the sun better with those little bits of clear plastic stuck in between them.
I ordered this a couple years ago as I work on computers all day long and often end up with a tense neck at the end of the day. I am an average person with the average sized neck.  It seemed like the "fingers" were too small and since they're in sync had the high potential to pinch the crap out of my neck when they met in the center. I also found the sound of the machine while operating to be distracting during use, and because I was so concerned about the pinching I didn't fully relax enough for it to work.  Maybe I shouldn't relax that much it could really get a good grab of the skin on the back of your neck!
Just my holy grail of earplugs. The foam ones don't stay in, and I don't like the idea of plastic in my ears. I actually divide up each of the plugs into two, so they go further, and that works fine. I do re use them a few times, but I think ideally for hygiene you'd probably only use them once (have never gotten any ear infection or anything using them.)I have lifelong issues with getting to sleep (delayed circadian rhythm), but have found earplugs and eyemask help (the latter if I'm not in a pitch black room), together with a fan, a cool room, avoiding screens late at night, magnesium supplements, and getting some sunshine every day (and if I can't using a light box in the morning). These things all have helped me a lot!
I've tried every product I could find over the years and none work as well as these Mack's plugs. These stay in my ear all night and never fall out.I absolutely, positively, always travel with these - I'm a light sleeper and I find I frequently need these at hotels. If your spouse has a tendency to snore these can also be a lifesaver. And, yes, once in a while, in a really noisy place, my wife uses them and is extremely happy I carry these with me. She loves them as well.Before I found Mack's I was actually considering travelling with a set of the ear protectors they sell at gun shops. Those work well too by the way in terms of using at home, but they're a little too bulky to travel with.
These make excellent play-doh for your little neices and nephews but as earplugs I found them bitterly disappointing. As bitterly disappointing as an earplug can be, that is. Yes, they are soft and can conform to the interior of your ear, but all they do is muffle sound; in no way did they drown out the annoying cacophony of my neighbor who likes to start his parties at one in the morning. Perhaps they are better for higher-pitched sounds that don't have much bass in them, but they didn't save me any sleep.
I have a heavy & hard to shave beard and this shaver does not cut it (pun intended) when compared to my (new) Remington MS3-3700 foil shaver. Although the shave was adequate, I had to go over and over and over the same spots to get it where I wanted it, and no amount over "going over" would give me a smoothly shaved chin, mustache or neck area. Another issue with all Norelcos is that monthly or so you're supposed to take the heads out and clean them individually, taking care not to mix the rotors with the wrong screen.  I'm just not the type of person who will do this regularly.  Foil shavers are much easier to clean because you just pop the foil out and either brush, blow or rinse, depending on the particular model)
The Norelco Quadra is an excellent shaver and I wondered if this shaver would do better or whether it just has more bells and whistles.  Well, the Spectra does shave more smoothly and more closely than the Norelco Quadra.  The shaver just glides across and shaves more closely than any other shaver I have used, electric or blade.  It is pricey but worth it in my opinion.  100 minutes on a single charge is nice and the shaver is stainless steel.  It feels great in the hand and comes with a matching stand and a leather pouch.  Amazon[.com] price is the best I could find, along with excellent service.
Although I'm a couple of years past the half-century mark, my skin is still prone to break outs.  That is why I can't use a blade as my primary shaver.  I've had the 8894XL since it first came out.  It gives a very good shave, but not as close as a blade.  But the best thing is there is minimal irritation.Thinking I could get a closer shave with an electric razor, I got the top of the line Braun.  It did give me a shave as close as a blade, but at the expense of great irritation and break outs.  It made me appreciate the Norelco more.If getting the closest possible shave at all costs is the most important quality you are seeking in an electric razor, get the Braun.  However, if you are plagued with irritation when shaving, then this Norelco is the shaver for you.  It is for me.Oh, and the razor is easy to clean.
The guy around the house swears by this razor. (If a good razor gets him to shave, I am all for it.) Many men have sensitive skin and an adjustable blade means that they can get a comfortable shave --a big plus here at home. The heads are washable, and over time, if they need replacement, the top flips out and the elements can be replaced with new. The charge lasts long enough for trips away from home for several weeks without bringing a charger. What more could you want? It's worth every penny.
I am cursed with very sensitive skin and get rashes every time I shave, even with a simple blade and "sensitive" shaving cream.  I finally decided (after much research and a friends advice) to buy this (rather pricey I thought) Norelco.  It was money well spent!  I have not had a rash, nick or burn since!  It is extremely smooth (interestingly shaped heads too) and I suspect it will last a long time.  The timer gives you lots of warning in case you plan on taking it on the road.  The leather case is kind of nice too.  It's money well spent.  Plus, you can always return it if you are not satisfied.
I had a 710RL that just finally started sputtering after 10+ years. So I have been using the Norelco triple head system for years. I had a foil before that and won't go back to those. I only occasionally shave with a blade when I have grown out the goatee and need to take the coarse stuff all off after trimming.This razor is quiet! I was always worried about waking the baby in the next room with my old corded razor....  And the 7885XL contours to the face VERY Nicely. The individual movements of the heads allow it to go over the chin and around the mouth area very easily. I haven't gotten through my 30 day trial period yet so don't have a full history shaving with it yet. But the technological advancements in the last 10 years show.Price was comparable to the low end Spectra's and I didn't see a need for the spring adjustment for sensitivity.Cleaning has been much easier than my old triple head system!
Philips Norelco HQ8 Spectra Tripleheader Replacement HeadsWorks great...  So far so good...But - This is the designated replacement head for my Norelco 7310XL but the screen is different from the one that came with the razor. Not a perfectly round shape. The new screens do fit perfectly into their own place despite the difference.The blades are different too. The original disc had 14 or 15 blades and the new one has 9. Is this just saving pennies? Will it affect the quality of shave?A notice on the box would have been helpful. It would have been nice to know these differences...
They may have been quality blades in the past, but they are not!!!! My husband and father have the same shaver and use to love it. But now our local stores don't carry the blades. Of course, being a regular Amazon shopper, we look here. I still love Amazon, but beware of this seller!!! my dad went through 3! yes 3 blades in a month! After him using this shaver for over 4 years, I believe him when he says these blades are NOT legit! He checked they look real, they have the stickers and printing like the real deal! But they aren't! Sad. Makes Amazon look bad, even though it's not their fault the seller has real well done FAKE products!
The blades that came with my razor finally gave out...it felt like they were pulling my whiskers out instead of cutting them off. When I put these replacements in, I was amazed at just how bad I'd let those old blades get. My razor again gives me a close, smooth shave without any discomfort.The original blades lasted over two years, but I'll probably not wait that long to replace these. There's really no reason for putting up with any discomfort due to old blades (like I did with the previous set).
Best shave yet. To prolong life, rinse blades after every use under regular sink water. Also, use 1/4 cup of alcohol and let blades sit for half hour once a month to remove grease and oils accumilated on the blades. Failure to do so, will eventually dull the blades and you will not get the long life you can get out of it. I have a medium growth beard shaving 4 times a week. I i dont have to replace the blades for years. I have been cleaning this way for over 30 years and very rarely replace the blades.
My razor is again performing like new.  I am well satisified with these heads. They cut at least as well as the heads supplied with the razor.One thing I have learned is that I can't go a year between replacing the heads.  Fortunately Amazon now offers a program to send the item each time interval, up to 6 months, that you specify.  I signed up for this to be sure that I will get new heads every 6 months for a price below the listed price and with shipping free.
These replacement heads make a Norelco shaver like new again.  They are well made and (for me) last more than the one year Norelco suggests for replacement.Aside from the blades themselves, they also replace the head, a grate above the blades.  This is important because the grate can bend if you just throw the shaver in your luggage without its protective cover.For the same reason, you should be careful when you open the packaging.  The inside plastic container is a little hard to open, and when I did, the heads fell to the floor and scattered.  I don't know for sure, but I suspect that that is the reason they did not work well - so I got a replacement, and was more careful.BOTTOM LINEFour stars, which on Amazon means "I like it".  They do what they should do, and nothing to complain about (except maybe the packaging).
i had no idea how expensive the heads were until i went looking at a nearby brick and mortar store which carried my razor but no replacement heads! then i went searching local stores finally found a set but for forty bucks thanks but no thanks. so i looked online with amazon and was pleasantly surprised to find these at a fraction of the price plus i was able to make use of an online coupon for another five bucks off! when we spend a hundred plus on a razor it just doesn't make any sense not to keep it in shape and that means swapping out the heads on an annual basis. my bad for waiting so long to replace the blades. getting them here is the best imho without breaking the bank or needlessly wasting time searching the isles of brick and mortar stores trying to find heads that will fit our particular make/model of shavers.
I have used Norelco since 1965, and I started with the two blade Norelcos.  These are pretty good blades and I suppose the theory of having two different size holes for different hairs makes sense, but it slows down the overall shave time.  I currently use HQ55, HQ8, and HQ9 and the HQ9 are the fastest and closest and, of course, the most costly.  Since the HQ8 and HQ9 are usable on any razor that is designed for either, I mix both on the same razor with 2 HQ8 blades and one HQ9.  It saves a bit of money and I get the benefits of both.Watch for Christmas sales and coupons.
I bought this replacement cutting head when it was available as a deal of the day from this website.  The cost was great and my electric razor wasn't doing its job anymore.  A few days later and I had the replacement cutting head.  It took less then 5 minutes to remove, clean and replace the cutting head with the new replacements.  Now my razor cuts as good as new.  Next time these come up as a deal of the day, I'll buy another set as a spare.
My razor feels like new again with these, that simple, very smooth and maybe even better than new.You should note that in my case, these heads were actually a slightly varied design on the tops of the heads, the slits/openings on these heads were different than the originals - I'm no engineer, but it seems they've improved the design, while maintaining backward compatibility.Get 'em.UPDATE:  At this point about 15 months later, heads are still ok, but do occasionally PULL on the hairs if it starts getting full, probably will replace these soon.
I was spending $25-30 every month for a very conservative bikini wax. Four months ago I spent $12 on this product and haven't looked back. It's very easy to use, nontoxic, and, best of all, very easy to clean up. Unlike wax, this just washes away with a wet washcloth. I'm not sure I'd want to home wax with a wax-based product, because I'd be worried I'd ruin my linens. Not so with this. I can see what other reviewers mean that it's so easy, it makes you want to wax it all!
I use MOOM Organic Hair Remover for my underarms and bikini line. To use MOOM, I place the uncovered jar in the microwave for 10 seconds and then follow the directions in the instruction packet that correspond to the area of my body I'm MOOMing. Afterward, I cleanse the area with witch hazel on a cotton pad, wash the muslin strips with hot water and soap and air-dry them.MOOM removes underarm and bikini line hair without irritation that leads to bumps and hyperpigmentation on my dark brown skin. MOOM is effective, easy to use, economical and eco-friendly so I'll be a user for life!  I buy 12 ounce jars of MOOM from Vitacost or iHerb.Note: Every time I've used MOOM on my upper lip -- two separate occasions -- I had a bad skin reaction (minus 1 star). Because of this, I give MOOM 4 stars rather than 5.Ingredients: Cane Sugar, Lemon, Chamomile Tea, Water, Tea Tree Essential Oil
I have paid professionals to hot wax me and ended up with broken skin vessels (purple bruises), wax stuck to my skin, bleeding and areas where not all the hair is removed. I tired the hard wax at home and it was painful and messy and have had wax stuck to my skin that no matter what I tired, I could not get off.  I tried the wax strips which were painful, messy and didn't remove all the hair.  I love this product.  It is easy to use, hurts the least of all the waxing methods I've tried, wonderful to clean up. You can reuse the strips, but I think that is gross and after you rinse them they are all crinkly.  I ordered a huge roll of muslin and just cut it to the length I want then throw the used ones away. I do not understand why anyone would ever use any other product to wax with. If you are going to wax, this is absolutely the way to go.
I bought this based on reviews I read on Amazon and I am extremely pleased with this product.  I tried hot wax (Sally Hansen's lavendar version for sensitive skin)  While the hot wax did not irritate my skin - it was tedious, messy, and hard to get the right temperature.  This Moom - was so much easier because it is easy to get off with water and reapply.  With the wax, it sometimes clung to my skin and then I had to remove patches of it.  This doesn't happen with Moom.  Plus, I love that it is made of environmentally friendly products - even the strips are reusable!
Now, my mom saw this at a Marshalls and bought it for me because she knew I was unhappy with what I was using. I was switching between Nads and Sally Hansen. I'm never going back to either of those. I love Moom.Why I love Moom so much? There is less pain, it smells good, it isn't as sticky and it is SUPER easy to clean up. My waxed areas are also never irritated after using it. But really, the best thing about Moom is how easily it comes off your skin and the cloth you use to wax. Oh, and I know I mentioned this, but I have to mention it again. This one is sooo much less painful, especially once you get the hang of it and done it a few times.If your room temperature is a little on the warm side, you won't have to heat this up. I highly recommend this product- I'm never going to use anything else.
When I first used this, it was the most painful experience EVER. I got teary eyed. I'm not a big baby but I thought I had wasted my money when I used it.BUT, I decided not to let that get in my way so I used it again a few weeks later and TADAH....No pain. I was whoa confused. But I guess after the first time I got used to it.I have used traditional waxing and SUGAR waxing is way less painful and this is SO EASY to clean up.
I got this product because I am a sucker for organic products. I was very excited to use it but then the first time I put the wax in the microwave for the amount of time on the directions and the wax burned me. That wouldn't have been much of a problem since you can just put the wax in for less time. However the wax itseld was very sticky and messy and the strips did not work very well. Also it's kind of nasty to wash the strips each time because you're supposed to soak them in water and all the water and wax comes off. I prefer the strips that already have wax on them, they are much easier to use and way more effective!
I wanted to try this because it is organic. I feel like anything organic, is better than those synthetic stuff. I watched a few youtube videos and tried it on myself (underarms and brazilian) - and it does the job well!the directions state to microwave it first (but it gets toooo hot for me).. so i never microwaved mine anymore, and it works just fine.and I bought a box of tongue depressors here on amazon (really cheap for 500 in a box), and i find them to be a better applicator than the skinny sticks...
I have tried this  afew times and followed the directions. I made sure to do everything the package said and it did not take off hardly any hair. I tried it on my face, neck, bikini area, and legs. It worked ok on my face and my legs. It took some hair off my legs but only light hairs on my face but did not take hair off anywhere else. I will try again on my legs one day when I have more time. The only plus for this product is it did not bother my skin so I will try again.Tryied again and it did not work I only got a few hairs off and red skin:(
So for my upper lip and certain other areas, this product worked pretty well and didn't really irritate my skin. For the dense, curly hair around the chin, under the chin and more complicated curvy ares, not so much. It is messy, as others have said, but it cleans up with warm water which is nice. I am torn about the product because it works well in some areas and almost not at all in others. I don't think this will be a wax replacement for most, but those with fine hairs that grow a little long, maybe so.
This is a great basic first aid kit, it contains everything you need for mild to moderate every day scraps and minor injures. I keep one of these in my car and one in my sports bag. This kit has come in handy several times as I have been the first on the scene to auto accidents and I can't stress enough how important it is to keep rubber gloves in your car. But I am pleased with the variety of sizes of bandaids, I added a few other things such as a few CPR mouth guards, and cheap stethoscope. But this is a good kit just to have around the house for everyday use.
this is nice to have for a camping trip or even a BOB. but u may want to add a few things to upgrade to a next level bag. triple antibiotic cream, pack of antibiotic "general". trauma Israeli battle dressing, Braunamid Synthetic Suture / Needle Combinations - 40 cm - 3/0 Fine, Surgical Disposable Sterile Skin Stapler w/Enhanced Control, 35 Preloaded Staples. Saline 0.9% 250 ml, Sodium Chloride, IV. don't forget the IV supplies for connecting the bag and IV start 18gage needle... if you go with the Sodium Chloride bag better "500 ml". saline Nose/eye flush. higher pain meds for traumas. some curlex rolls and Aquaphor for burns, but it dose come with a burn cream. A few Mainstay Emergency Food Rations 2400 Calorie Bars. the bag will fit more, I have it packed and it still can fit more. shipped fast like this little kit great for camping.
This pretty little toy is a variation on that old standby, the torpedo-shaped vibrator. Like the other members of the Natural Contours family, this vibrator was designed by a woman for women, and it shows! The Jolie is waterproof, with a gentle bend in the middle, and a smoothly angled tip. It requires one AA battery.Now, as for vibration, the Jolie has only one speed, and it is high-frequency and gentle. So, if you are looking for intense vibes, then this is not for you. Also, like too many vibrators, the batteries have a tendency to rattle in this one, making it too noisy. I tried adding a piece of facial tissue, and it did help, but it is still a little too noisy.But, that said, I do like this vibrator, and recommend it. If you are looking for a gentle vibrator that seems to have been designed directly for your body, then you will like the Jolie.
I purchased this product from another site, but it's the exact same product. I left a review there, but I want to leave one here too. This would be a great product if it was made better. This lasted two uses for me, and then the red brush part detached. No, I wasn't trying to remove back from a tree or anything, just lint and pet hair from my clothes and futon. Save your money, don't buy this product. Buy the sticky rollers, or (I can't vouch for this but) 3M has a brush, I'm going to try that instead. If that doesn't work it's back to sticky rollers..
I used to own the Evercare Adhesive Roller I picked up at a Target but I haven't been able to locate this brand anymore in store. I wear black dresses often for work and I can't stand lint on black clothing in any fashion. I bought this brush based on the reviews and I like it. It's removes most of the lint from my dresses and other clothing. It does tug a bit at the clothing as you're brushing which I didn't care for, now I just use shorter brush strokes. It works for the most part and was a good purchase, however I feel I still need an adhesive roller for the stubborn lint.
I have tried those peel off 'sticky' rollers, but those are basically useless. Only removing surface lint, nothing embedded such as pet hair.The cloth material that has a one way 'grain' with the right amount of pressure removes most of the pet hair, far better than most anything else. BUT, the cheap plastic handle will eventually crack due to it's poor design. It's not the fact it's plastic, it's the fact it is not reinforced properly. Before anyone says I'm using excessive pressure, if you don't if won't pick up enough. Mind you, I'm not bending the handle in the process, just being 'assertive'.My other gripe is, there are arrows on the handle next to the cloth, but one can't easily see which way they point since the handle is black. They need to be painted and recessed, not raised. Brush the wrong way and the lint & hair returns from the surface you are trying to clean.
This is my third Braun foil shaver - and it is the best.  I realize that many features on my Flex Integral are not a necessity.  I'd rather have stong NiMh battery that comes in 5614 than NiCd battery with memory effect and which dies after a year or two of use.  By the way, Braun runs a -t.e.n.d.o.l.l.a.r.r.e.b.a.t.e- program on the shaver until Jan 1, so do not miss out.  It shaves as close as my Flex Integral, I like the hard case, and I am glad it does not have room for the cord since one charge gives me two weeks of shaving - I have very think hair.  The cord is bulky since it has the AC/DC converter in the head of the cord - not in the shaver.  The low charge indicator gives me an adequate warning.  The manual incorreclty says that the red light will be flashing when 20% left.  The red light simply turns on.
These brushes are a very effective way of thoroughly cleaning your teeth and gums.  The soft bristles clean your teeth and massage your gums efficiently, and the color bands are a convenient way to color-code heads for multiple users.  There's even a spare in case you lose one.Of course you should still floss before brushing, but the small soft brush and the speed of the rotation makes daily dental hygiene easy and painless.When I ordered this item, it was shipped by an Amazon partner, who packaged it in a HUGE box, filled with plastic packing material.  I could hardly find the small package inside the carton.High marks for the product, huge waste of packing material and postage for the packaging.
I thought the first defective brush head was a fluke, but when I started using the second, and then the third, it was obvious that this package was defective. Bristles slowly fell out. From the beginning, one or two bristles fall out with each use and often get wedged between my teeth.  These brush heads were sold as new, but should had honestly been sold as "New and DEFECTIVE". The seller has not contacted  me but I suspect that they knew they were defective when they obtained them. For the first time in my very long and active Amazon history, I think I was "ripped off". Since it took a few months to realize all the brush heads were like this, it's likely too late to get my money back.
Remember when you didn't need to replace your toothbrush every 12 weeks? It's almost a certainty that the hype about frequent brush replacement was started by the companies that make them. And Oral-B seems to further manipulate their customers into a steady stream of cash by engineering these brushes to go badly quickly. Within a couple of months use, the bristles on these brushes completely wear out, far quicker than one would expect or than used to happen on their old brushes. My best guess is that they design these things to deteriorate at a rapid pace to make more money. While the power toothbrush works quite well, just be aware that buying these things pretty much locks you into a regular brush replacement regimene that will cost a family of four over $100 a year.
I purchased this from Mr. Bargain. As some others have noted, the package may have been imported from Germany. The text on the package is in several languages including English.It is a Braun product, not any imitation. I immediately started using one of the brush heads to test it. It seems perfectly normal and fine, exactly the same as the brush heads that came with the original Braun toothbrush.Mr. Bargain's service was outstanding. Within about 2 hours of placing the order on Amazon.com, I received an email from Mr. Bargain that it was being shipped. The email included the USPS tracking number. I received the product the next day by US Mail, packed in a nice padded envelope.
I've used these brush heads for several months now and they do a great job (while still leaving some enamel on my teeth).  Amazon shipped them promptly & there were no problems.  I've read some unhappy reviews on brush heads that apparently seem to be the same thing, but turn out not to be quite the same.  So just be sure that, out of the plethora of brush heads, you choose the genuine Oral-B brand and that they're shipped & sold by Amazon.
I like this softer brush much better than the harder bristle brushes although I switch off with the floss brush head a couple of times a week.  I had stopped using the electric tooth brush and after a couple of years, although I was diligent with the manual brush, I noticed that my gums seemed to be receding a little.  My dentist confirmed that although I was getting my teeth and gums clean, also due to good flossing, my gums were doing better with the electric toothbrush so I retreived my unit from the cabinet and have been happy using the Oral B again.
I find this brush to be far more comfortable to use than the standard Oral-B brush head -- no gum irritation at all, but it still gets my teeth feeling clean.  I alternate between this brush and the Floss-Action head (the one with the plastic paddles in addition to the bristles). The Floss Action works better at getting in between teeth, but can be a bit hard on the gum line (but not as bad as the standard brush head). Using and alternating between both the soft and the Floss Action works very well for me.
Though it might not appear so, these "Extrasoft EB17" brush heads are functionally the same as the "children's" heads sold with various cartoon characters on the package. If you find them listed for about $5 per brush head, that's a good bargain (I've seen 1-2 sold for $18).Note that the standard adult Flexisoft EB17 has dual colors, while the Extrasoft heads are all blue. Ensure that the description states "extra-soft" and the illustration is the all-blue bristle head.
Oral B Sensitive Toothbrush HeadsThe sensitive bristles are extremely soft and also fine. In my honest opinion, the sensitive toothbrushes are generally a better way to clean your teeth. The medium to stiff bristles seem too large in diameter and stiff. These type of bristles are great for scrubbing stubborn particles, but not really that great for everyday cleaning of teeth especially when you use toothpaste that has fine abrasive particles. These brushes worked well with the sensitive mode on my Oral B 5000, although I found that my teeth didn't feel too bad even when using the full attack mode of the electric brush.Overall: 5/5
this brush is noticeably softer than the standard brush t the touch. my dentist tells me soft or extra soft are the only two options for brushes. i guess the others are hard on teeth and gums, especially on electric brushes. anyway, a few points to note.first this one has bristles that are flush across the top. the standard version have some raised bristles on the outer edge of the brush head. i wish these did because it feels like they do not get into the gaps as well.also worth noting that they don't feel much different once on the handle and rotating. they move so fast it seems like they are almost as harsh and standard brushes. i'll stick with these for now.
I'm a scrubber on my teeth. The teeth are clean but the gums started to recede. I switched to an Oral B years ago so I could keep my teeth as clean as I liked without scrubbing away all of my gums. My son bought a Sonic to try to keep his orthodontic braces clean and, as it was bought at Costco, came with a second handle. My teeth felt furry after using the Sonic so I gave him the handle for an extra and bought a new Oral B as my old one had no battery life. I still prefer the Oral B. He prefers his Sonic. The extra soft heads are my favourite as they are gentle to my gums. I still use a manual brush for my tongue but can get it almost as clean as with the Oral B. I like that the Oral B signals the end of a cleaning cycle but lets you brush longer to get the tongue or any spots still gritty. The Sonic shuts off at the end of its cycle.
If I buy something--lipstick, sunglasses, favorite drink, energy bar--whatever, it's sure to go out of stock.  I seem to be on the end of the curve.  I have sensitive teeth (as do many of us of a certain age), and I find I'm not as thorough in brushing as I need to be.  I bought the tooth brush years ago for a very reasonable price (like $20).  But the brushes? Not so reasonable.  Then I couldn't get them at all.  Turn to good old Amazon and there you are! These are just what I needed, and I'll be ordering them again, assuming I don't wear out the brush base itself.
I purchased these at the recommendation of my dentist.  I had gum surgery a few years ago, so I try to be careful, and these extra-soft brush heads are extremely gentle while still doing what they need to do.I usually switch to a new brush head every other month, so a package of 3 will last me 6 months.  I use this Oral-B toothbrushOral-B Professional Healthy Clean Floss Action Precision 5000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush(packaging may vary), and this brush head fits fine.I liked these so much I now have them on subscribe and save.
I recently purchase an Oral-B toothbrush. I have been a long-time Sonicare user.I decided to also try these sensitive head brushes besides what came with the toothbrush.  While the other ones do a fine job, I prefer these heads.  They are smaller and seem to me to do a great job.The one thing I miss from my Sonicare brushes is the head cover.  It would be nice to have something that could pop on the brush head especially when traveling.Other than that they are easy to get on and off and rinse easily.
I replaced the "Floss Action" head on my Smartseries 5000 with this "Sensitive" brush head.  The rotating part is taller, narrower, and much softer than the floss-action-- it feels better on my teeth, more like brushing and a lot less like a mechanical device is giving my teeth a beating.Oral-B brush heads fit most Oral-B toothbrushes, so you can switch between types of head easily.  This one feels more "snug" (harder to pull off) than the Floss Action which came with the brush. Especially if you floss anyway, the sensitive heads are easier on your mouth and seem to work just as well.
I have gum recession from using a regular toothbrush.  I was told by a hygenist to brush my gums, it would keep them healthy.  BAD idea.  It caused them to recede and I wish I had never listened to her.At any rate, using these heads has prevented that from happening anymore. They are soft and by using an electric toothbrush I can hold the brush head against the tooth itself, avoiding the gum line, let the vibrating bristles get my teeth sparkling clean and keep my gums healthy.Great find.
I would not use any other brush. When I was in Air Force basic training, we were marched into an auditorium to hear a variety of speakers - one being a dentist. He showed medical photos of a young trainee who &#34;performed oral surgery on herself&#34; by using a hard bristled brush. Don't use anything except a soft bristled brush! They work quite well.I have decided to add the following to all my reviews:Beware! Some &#34;reviewers&#34; will trash a product for no reason simply because they are paid to or because sell competitive products. Other &#34;reviewers&#34; will give products - that they have never seen and never used - glowing 5 star ratings - for a fee.  Some honest reviewers do not understand what a product is for or how to use it and will trash a product simply because they are just plain dumb.
I bought these for $13 incl. shipping so that was a great deal. I received the extra soft heads like I ordered. The brushheads work great with no issues. If you're thinking about saving a few bucks by buying the generic ones at walmart, don't. I did and they are not the same and are vastly inferior. They had a strong vibration to them that actually hurt my teeth and gums and were a lot noisier. Going back to the official heads made me appreciate how quiet and smooth the brush and handle operated.
I've been using the Oral B electric toothbrushes for about 10 years now and love them.I've tried these all-bristle brushes as well as the Floss Action brushes with the plastic gum massagers.Both types of brushes work great.  I recommend trying both and seeing which you prefer.  For me, I feel like the all-bristle brushes give a more focused cleaning.  I'm a religious flosser so I get plenty of gum stimulation.I also tried some generic brushes at one point, but the didn't seem to work as well.  They seemed to have more internal friction which made the head move slower.I highly recommend these brushes.
While I have to agree that the product description lacks clarity, I took a gamble based on the picture and was happy to receive heads that fit my system. Yes, it is still going strong after four years: it replaced a system I bought from the dentist office that crapped out after a year. The replacement heads are widely available, if you don't mind paying $23 for a pack of four - WHICH I DO MIND VERY MUCH. These were $10 for four and I'm a happy camper.
The Oral-B professional precision clean brush heads work perfectly with my Braun Oral-B Professional 3000 electric toothbrush.  The brush heads are very compact, fit around your mouth easily, and surround your teeth in a cup-like manner.  They don't have any special cleaning / polishing bristles like other Oral-B brush heads, but they clean very well regardless.The packaging is a very simple small cardboard box, that's easy to open.  Inside the box are the four brush heads, each in their own individual package.All in all...a must buy for those who have Oral-B electric toothbrushes.
When I ordered these, I really wasn't sure that they would fit my Braun toothbrush since the brush, to be honest, is about five years old.  But, the replacement head fits perfectly and it was a real pleasure to get the feel of a new brush on my teeth.  In the past when I ordered replacement heads on the internet some turned out to be fakes and I had to throw them out as the brush head came away from the body of the brush.  This DID NOT happen with these replacement brush head and I would definitely recommend purchasing same.
Oral-B Replacement Brush HeadsProfessional Model Eb-20-4 (the last 4 indicates there are 4 in the pack)Four packWe've used Oral-B electric toothbrushes for more than 10 years. We love them and our dentist enthusiastically recommends them. He especially promotes the fact that these give you cleaner teeth and also healthier gums via the oscillating stimulation that brushing by hand doesn't supply. The ends of the bristles are rounded for comfort. There are Indicator bristles that gradually fade from blue to white giving you a visual cue when to change the brush head. We usually change the heads 3-4 times per year. That means that this four-pack will supply you with a whole years worth of brushing. Each head includes a colored ring that snaps onto the base of the brush so that each family member can identify their own brush.A note of caution - Only purchase Oral-B branded replacements. There are quite a few inexpensive, generic versions and their quality is really iffy. Go for the original.
While these brush heads are not my favorites to use with myOral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Gum Care Precision 3000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush 1 Count, they still do a great job. (For the record, my favorite brush heads are theOral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head refill. I usually rotate the brush heads I use just to change things up a bit. I don't know if it makes a difference, but I feel like using different heads from time to time is a good idea. In any case, these brush heads are great.
I am a long time user of the Oral-B electric tooth brushes, having used just about every possible brush head type over the years. In general, the bigger and more intricate the brush head, the better the cleaning. This is especially true with these replacement brushes. These somewhat larger heads, with different size bristle lengths, seem to mold and conform to the teeth and gum surfaces for a more precise cleaning action.  And because these heads are bigger than the standard size bushes, the outer rotation of these brushes, with the different size bristles, provide for a more forceful and thorough cleaning action of the teeth and gums.  My teeth feel 'squeaky' clean afterwards.  These Oral-B brushes, and really the entire product line, are second to none when it comes to taking care of your teeth and gums.
My family has used various Oral-B toothbrushes for years.  I love them -- my teeth actually feel as clean as after a dentist visit after brushing my teeth every day.  We had always used the "default" replacement brushes and was quite happy with them, but Vine offered these so I thought I'd give them a shot.  I can't say whether they were effective at what was promised -- "flossing action"?  I dunno.  As with the other brush heads, my teeth feel nice and clean afterwards.  The brushes do have a different feel...a bit less comfortable.  My sons complained that they didn't like them as well.  I hope that's because it's cleaning better between the teeth.  When we use these up, I imagine I'll continue to buy whichever type is easiest to find/most economical.Note that nearly all Oral-B electric toothbrushes have the same attachment mechanism, so the different heads are interchangeable.
