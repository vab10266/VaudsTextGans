I bought this on impulse and it comes from Japan,  which amused my family,  all those weird stamps and markings on the package. So that was fun.  It said it would take about a month to arrive and it did take that long.  I was hoping for a more interesting taste but to our family,  it just tasted a bit less flavorful or weaker than the standard milk chocolate kit kat.  The green tea flavor was too subtle for the sugar and it just tasted sweet. The wafers were very crispy, and that was good,  but it tasted a bit anemic to us.I'm happy I bought it, but don't need to buy it again.
I've been looking forward to trying these after hearing about how popular they were in Japan, and among Kit Kat fans as well. I do not recommend ordering these during warm weather, because they can melt and become smushy. I ordered mine right when summer began, and they were a bit mushy so I let them solidify under room temp. Afterwards, I tried some and they tasted fine. I was expecting a stronger green tea or matcha flavor, but it is actually quite subtle. The outer coating was creamy and not overly sugary, which I liked. Overall, I wouldn't say it's insanely good, but definitely a yummy treat.
I love ethnic foods and to cook them. I recently purchased another product which was a major disappointment, so I was back to the drawing board.The reviews won me over, and free shipping, so I ordered one of each, red and green. Tonight I used the green for the first time and WOW! It made me look like a gourmet international chef - it is so incredibly good!It was definitely hot, though, which is fine with me but I was glad I had the coconut milk base. This is excellent and I will keep this on hand always.
So many flavors. I can't begin to tell you how much I love all of mae ploy curries. I should ask them for recipes. Basically its a plastic lidded container about the size of I wanna say two and one half yogurts. It has a bag inside that you pull out and inside that clear bag is the curry. Its all mashed in there. I cut a corner and take out  a little at a time. Having the spices mixed and its a paste makes it nicer to make a sauce and marry this flavor to anything. Veggies love it that are steamed, scrambled eggs, rice pasta and even fish and meat.
I have tried all the curris from Mae Ploy (excluding the Panag) and various other curry pastes out there. Mae Play is a solid and affordable curry paste that keeps. The Red has more heat, but the green has more spice. The Yellow and Matsaman curry paste don't really have any heat to me, but do taste good as well.For a holiday treat, substitute eggnog for coconut milk with the green curry. It is super delicious (just be advised your GI tract WILL hate you later for doing so)
These dyes create awesome colors for kids crafts. I have used them to make finger paint, paint, play dough, and salt dough.Another reviewer stated that they are not natural - this is CORRECT. They are definitely artificial dyes. I tried making my own dyes, and when that fell through, these worked great in a pinch. You only need a couple drops for really vibrant color. And they are pretty easy to clean - don't stain after they've been made into whatever craft.Good product for the price!
This product is no where near natural / organic-I only wish I had seen the other reviews before purchasing! It contains all the things I did not want-which is why I was looking for a natural alternative. They need to have an ingredient list on here to avoid this...I am &#34;returning&#34; item. I am trying to avoid my children's exposure to yellow 5, red 40 and so on...I do not understand how they can still make these things knowing what they can cause. This may be fine for someone that doesn't read labels or care what their kids eat-but not for my family.
My only complaint about this product is that sometimes it is difficult to squeeze just a very small amount from the bottle into the mixture to be colored.  I don't do massive amounts of baking, and I find that sometimes it is really hard to get a very light color when adding this product to very small quantities of mixture.  However, the colors are very bright and I was very pleased to find that the color is evenly distributed throughout the mixture.  I thought this product was a little pricy, but after trying it out, I do believe that it was worth the extra money.  The product seems of high quality and it shows in my cooking whenever I want to add some color to things.
I really enjoy these bars as a quick breakfast, lunch, or pre-workout snack.  I need something quick in the mornings and this does the trick.  They fill me up better than other bars on the market and I am a big fan of the taste.  I do eat alot of different meal and energy bars over the course of the week but I think these are my favorite.  I have been using subscribe and save for several shipments and I have never had a problem with old or stale items.  And Amazon seems to be much cheaper than buying individual bars at the grocery store.
If you are a fan of peanut butter and chocolate, than this bar is for you.  I've tried a number of energy bars and they all suffer from one problem -- bland taste and usually end up leaving a gritty aftertaste in my mouth.  Not so with PowerBar.I make a PowerBar part of my regular morning routine.  After trying a few of the other flavors I finally stumbled upon the peanut butter and chocolate chip and was "hooked".  The flavor is just right and the crispness of the bar is not too hard, but firm enough to make you "feel" like you are eating a full meal.  One bar will usually kill any cravings I have all throughout the morning.
I don't know about the medicinal aspects of this tea, but the flavor is downright scrumptious.  I love licorice root but have high blood pressure, so I'm not guzzling down box after box each week.  A few cups a week doesn't touch my BP, so I keep it to that.  The directions say to steep it for 10-15 minutes, but I'm far too impatient for that.  4-6 minutes is all I can wait after smelling that lovely aroma.  Traditional Medicinals puts out some really good teas.  I just wish they weren't so proud of 'em.  ChaChing!  Thanks, TM. Now try to work on that pricing for us, will ya?  Danke.
Traditional Medicinals is the best tasting herbal tea out there that I have tried. I have tried the Yogi teas before and did not care for them. I bought the Traditionals Breathe Easy and the Gypsy Cold Care. I take the breathe easy whenever I feel congested or like now when I had a coughing attack from some scent. My throat felt irritated and my chest felt achey and wheezy. Brewed a cup of this tea with some honey and it was so delicious and soothing. I don't know if its the way it makes you feel when you drink it because it tastes so good, or if the herbs really do help but I do feel better, a sense of calm. I highly recommend the Breathe Easy and the Gypsy Cold Care.
This is awesome.  It tastes like the fake marshmallows they put in immoral breakfast cereal, but instead of just tasting like sugar it tastes like fat as well.  I can't believe I never tried this stuff until now, but I am definitely going to keep a stack of these in my desk.Disclosure:1. Your block of "ice cream" WILL be broken into a bunch of smaller chunks.  It is so brittle that they probably all end up like that (this was the first one I ate, but one reason I passed on this stuff so many times is because I could tell by picking up the package that they were always broken).2. Partly for the above reason, astronauts don't actually eat this stuff any more.  Wikipedia says it was used on one mission and was found to be inconvenient.  Also, they have a freezer on the space station and just eat real ice cream.In spite of those facts, this stuff is delicious.
I bought these for a lightweight backpacking snack. From what I remembered as a kid they are very tasty, and I was not disappointed! I've read other reviews complain about they come broken apart - but that's normal/acceptable - it in no way effects the quality of this product. The packaging of this is bulky - almost 0.4oz per! Luckily this product stays fresh in just a ziplock bag for at least a week. I put most of these in a gallon ziplock and saved several ounces in weight over ditching the stock packaging material. Gave some to my son and he loved them as well - they make a great/unique gift to kids.
I've been using "Melitta Cone Coffee Filters, Natural Brown, No. 1" for years with myBlack & Decker DCM18S Brew 'n Go Personal Coffeemaker with Travel Mug, but I can no longer find them at any of my local stores. Luckily I found them by the case at Amazon for much less than what I was paying for them at the store. I now have enough filters to last me at least 2 years. These filters fit my 1 cup Black and Decker coffee maker perfectly, and do a much better job filtering the coffee than the permanent filter that comes with it. Another supposed benefit is that paper coffee filters trap oily substances in coffee called "diterpenes", which are said to raise your cholesterol levels, and are not filtered out if you use the permanent mesh filter.  I highly recommend using the "Melitta Cone Coffee Filters, Natural Brown, No. 1".
These filters fit nicely inside my individual-sized ceramic beverage strainer.  Placed atop a coffee mug or teacup, the filter enables me to make coffee, or tea, minus coffee grounds or tea leaves in the end product!  Simply place the ground coffee or loose tea inside the filter, and pour in boiling water to fill the mug/cup.  Alternatively, if are serving a group, coffee can be prepared in a percolator & loose tea in a teapot...then, poured through filters into individual cups to remove any grounds/tealeaves. I became unable to locate the smaller sizes of these filters (such as this #1) in local retail stores years ago--and was thrilled to discover that Amazon could supply them.
Licorice is my favorite candy, and it promotes good digestion. Since I have some digestive issues, I eat licorice on a regular basis. I've tried basically every brand. I bought this because it's advertised as soft licorice. However, it is the same consistency as the cheapest stuff on the grocery store shelf; the difference is that this has a stronger flavor. The flavor is nice. The consistency and texture is terrible. I bought another package hoping the first was just old/stale, but the next package was the same. I threw away both packages.
These soft licorice bites from Panda are not as soft as the &#34;soft-eating licorice&#34; from Down Under but are what I would describe as soft but chewy. They are truly &#34;all natural&#34; and have a minimum of ingredients&#8211;&#8211;molasses, wheat flour, licorice extract, and natural flavor (aniseed oil). Nothing more than that. They have a slightly grainy texture, which comes from the use of wheat flour. They also have a strong, traditional licorice taste, which make them ideal for a person with a craving for genuine licorice.
I will come clean to you, here and now, and admit that I do have ONE addiction.  That addiction is this totally wonderful Panda licorice.  For starters, it isn't too sweet. Secondly, it is made with anise oil and has a wonderful flavor.  Plus, the blurb on the side of the box is right.  Licorice does have mellowing properties and helps with digestion, and I also notice that I feel less stressed after I eat it.  [Or is this purely psychological?]  It's wonderful for those days when you are craving a treat, but don't want to feel guilty afterwards.  It's fat free and you should definitely keep it in on a high shelf out of reach, or you might find yourself eating the box in just a couple of days!
I bought a case of all three products, Inka, Pero and Cafix in order to compare them. Honestly? They are all the same, so go with whatever is the cheapest. I think I did like Cafix the best, but it may be a mental thing with the name at least sounding somewhat like Coffee. There is little difference in all three, they look identical with only tiny coloration differences. All by themselves they do not taste like coffee and if you are a black coffee drinker? Pass, because you will not be satisfied with the taste. It is very bland all by itself. BUT, if you like cream in your coffee? You won't even notice the difference between coffee and these products within a week or two you will forget you are not drinking coffee. I am PERFECTLY happy with all three products and will continue to drink them;I will choose by PRICE due to the very similar make of them all. The cans all read the same ingredient wise.
This is a great product to accent your pizza and pasta sauces without adding the things you don't want into your diet!  It is a little bit hot as a seasoning and you can also sprinkle it onto spaghetti or pizza.  It is also very good when sprinkled onto casseroles or soups.  I like it as it has no calories, no total fat, no sodium, no carbohydrates and no additional protein.  It also contains no MSG or any preservatives.It lets you add the zest you like without adding items like salt or calories.  This is a good product and we like it as a seasoning for many of our Italian dishes.  I recommend it to you as a good product.
Okay so for the price, this is to be expected, after all, it's organic. I was in a pinch for vanilla extract (REAL Vanilla Extract) and I bought here on Amazon. I know for the same price, this cost just as much at my local Whole Foods, but I bought here and was quite pleased with the product. It's a real high quality extract and using it in my baked goods and some other dishes, I could tell the difference in taste. I use a lot of vanilla extract so for me the only real downside is/was they don't make it bigger. Perhaps I will have to buy this in bulk.
I mean this stuff was roasted how long ago? A far lesser coffee roasted a couple of days ago is going to taste a whole lot better. At $50 per pound, what you're tasting is justification for spending the money. What you should do, if you have the money for this sort of coffee, is buy a coffee roaster and start getting good green beans (including Jamaican Blue Mountain) and roasting them fresh yourself. The folks at Sweet Maria's have all the info you need to get started.
First a little background on me. I Am a coffee drinking fiend. I probably keep several countries coffee production up, so I know coffee. I don't mind strong coffee or so so tasting coffee I just dont expect it to be expensive so so tasting coffee. I have had and love Jamaican Blue mountain coffee before but it was a lot more expensive than this. This came in a cute little burlap sack (you get some style points there) but after that it's pretty much down hill. The coffe is not the normal rich tasting wonderfull smelling JBM I have had before, it just tastes like every other coffee albeit at an extravagent price. I have ordered some more Blue mountain from another supplier will have to see how that goes. This is one that will not get any repeat business from me. There are plenty of other better tasting coffees out there at a lower price.
These are the best paper coffee filters I've found.  Just make sure to fold over the crimped edges so that the filter doesn't come apart during brewing.  I use the "pour over" method of brewing coffee with a filter cone because most coffee makers do not get the water hot enough for a proper brew.  I brew directly in to a stainless carafe.Unlike other reviewers, I received all 12 boxes of filters.I use this filter cone & brew directly in to my stainless carafe:Copco 2 Quart Thermal Capacity Brushed Stainless Steel CarafeRSVP Maunual Drip Coffee Filter Cone for Carafes or ThermosI use this water kettle to heat the water:Oster 5965 Stainless-Steel 1-1/2-Liter Electric Water Kettle
Like everyone else, I have discovered that it is no longer possible to find the number 6 filters in local stores. I do not understand this. I live forty miles from New York City, hardly a wilderness area. However, I was happy to find the filters on Amazon. By combining the filters with another order, I was able to get free shipping.Is brown better than white? Many people believe that since the brown filters require less processing than the white filters, i.e., white filters are bleached, the brown filters are better environmentally. I will go with that. My experience has been that the brown filters tend to break through more often than the white ones. These seem to be ok, but I do give them an extra fold where they are joined on the side and the bottom.
Yes, they are totally artificial. But for special events like birthdays, I honestly feel that its okay to use them, and nothing colors frosting like gel food coloring. I used to buy the single larger colors, but Id end up having them for years, and they do get funky tasting. Im so happy to have found this assortment. It has every color a person could need, including dark and light skin tones. And you can blend them to make even more shades if you desire.Each color comes in a smaller size than when you buy them individually, which is great for me because I only use them 4-5 times a year.
Yeah, this dye is tasteless as advertised!  I know there are already a million 5 star reviews but I thought I would join the chorus anyways. The dyes here are really vibrant and most importantly tasteless. This allows you to make really beautiful fondant cakes.  I literally put like 1 drop of this dye gel in about a 4" ball of fondant and it came out the shade I wanted. The colors are pretty much full spectrum of the rainbow plus black. You can mix and match if you want to get more colors. I found it very easy to use. There are instructions on the box. I paired this with purchased fondant and made a very lovely orange, red, and black Halloween themed cake. I can't wait to use these again. For the price of less than $11, I feel like I got a good deal.
I often cater for parties or events and every once in awhile I get someone who just has to have an off color. Trying to recreate these colors without buying a ton of different food colors is really hard, however this has such a strong color that you only need a little. I will admit that it takes some getting use to as you can't double dip and because the colors are so potent it can be a little hard to create certain colors. There is a colormap on the back that will help you to create all kinds of colors, so you don't have to waste time trying to figure it out yourself. The only word of caution I would give as usual is that the purple and black dye are horrid! If you are a baker, you already know this, but if you're new to the baking game, you will thank me for that tip later.
Prompt arrival of product. I used some mixed with water to make a liquid to marinate my strips of meat. The spice is mixed directly into hamburger meat as you make that kind of jerky. I had some left over after marinating so I stuck it in the freezer so as not to just waste what was left, and i think it will be fine to thaw and add to for my next batch. ( I liked the hand striped solid meat better than the hamburger meat jerky). Good stuff if you aren`t into making your own spices for jerky like me.
I buy this at WalMart...it's by the food dehydrators/blenders/coffee makers.  It's a little cheaper there than I see it here...but honestly if you calculate how much the meat and seasoning is, you are saving a lot of money.  We love commercial jerky, but it's too expensive.  We use our Nesco dehydrator, jerky gun and ground beef.  I just buy whatever beef is on sale, mix it with this seasoning and it's amazing!  We've only make ground beef jerky with this, but that's all we eat anyway.  Excellent product...delicious jerky.  I like to make batches as gifts for people...trim the ends of the jerky strips so they look nice and put them in a glass cylinder, tied with a ribbon.  People LOVE getting it and it's an inexpensive gift.  Buy it!
I ordered this and the Cracked Pepper and Garlic flavors, both worked out well but I liked the original more.  I used this as exactly as I could to the volume of weight and it did seem a little extra salty - I know Jerky is supposed to be salty of course but if I had one and only one complaint it would be regarding that.  Next time I'll try limiting some of the salt and see how that goes, but either way I do recommend this product it's very easy to use and tastes good. Oh, I used this both for ground beef (using a jerky gun) and for flank steak pieces.-D
See's Candies is a well-known California chocolate company, now with stores and distribution throughout the United States.  In California, the lines to buy chocolate can snake out the door.  I've had See's Candies many times, most recently this assortment, and while See's makes an excellent product, the chocolate coating could be richer in flavor.  Still, these confections are above average; they easily outclass ordinary brands such as Russell Stover and Whitman's with fresher and more flavorful fillings.Anyone receiving a box of See's Candies for a gift knows that an extra effort has been made.  Although they aren't the best I've had, they certainly rank up there with the finest chocolate assortments available in a box.
I love this stuff! It is great in dipping sauces. I also like this in my chicken soup broth or pretty much any soup. I wouldn't think of eating Ramen noodles normally but with some of this stuff, I will eat it and like it. I think it is better than Schriacha sauce, you just have to be careful and use a small amount till you know how strong it is and then you will be adding  it to everything. I do a quick dipping sauce with soy sauce, vinegar, sugar and this oil. Great for dumplings! This is a staple that everyone should have in kitchen.
My favorite nearby Asian food mart is closing with plans to reopen months from now in a new location.  I need this stuff badly as a staple that must always be in stock, but I don't need it badly enough to pay nearly twice what it costs in a retail store, plus nearly double that again to have it sent to me.  I love Amazon so I hate it when Amazon is the worst possible place to buy a product, but there it is.I will look around for other sources because this stuff is AWESOME.  It has more fire than the relatively wimpy chili oils in the ethnic sections of mainstream US grocery stores, but you can control the burn factor by choosing how much to use in your recipe or as a condiment.  The flavor is subtle and isn't overbearing even if you load it on to increase the heat.  Very versatile and very good.
this stuff is a poor example of an authentic 5-spice powder which I paid $1.5 for 4oz locally, despite the fact that other Dynasty products are useful such as their Satay sauce.  I live walking distance to Flushing Queens, and have a good idea what it's supposed to taste like from authentic Asian cooking sold nearby. If you want to go cheap off Amazon, you are better off withFrontier Five Spice Powder, 1.92-Ounce Bottle.  BTW "star anise" or "aniseed" is already a licorice flavor, so to add even more licorice to this bottle was foolish.
I've never used Chinese Five Spices before, but we had a holiday goose and I wanted to try it in combination with citrus to flavor the bird. It was a real winner and I loved the spice combo. In fact, I like it so much that I'm finding other recipes just to use more of it.This brand seemed to be of good quality and fresh, as well as being reasonably priced. We live in the country and don't have any stores that would carry such things, so I was really glad to find it online.If you've got a recipe that calls for it, I highly recommend giving this one a shot.
I had bought my first container of Dynasty Five Spices to smell. I love the aroma! Then I started using it in my marinated cucumbers 'n' onions. Well, it doesn't last forever that way. I tried another brand of five spices but it didn't even begin to compare to Dynasty. There isn't anywhere around close where I can buy it so I was glad to find it on Amazon. True, the shipping is a little steep but I pay more than the total for spices in stores. This was worth it!
I was aboslutely shocked to see how much 1 oz really was. At $7.60, I mistakenly assumed it would be a decent sized can. As locally I am able to buy a medium sized tube of wasabi paste for around $3, but never used it fast enough so it would get old. I figured a powder would be better, so I can mix it as I needed it. When I opened the box and dug thru the packing and saw this little little can, I started looking for the hidden cameras ...  thought this HAD to be a joke. Nope .. and it's NOT returnable either. SO I HAVE LEARNED MY LESSON. Please just be aware if you should decide you want this EXPENSIVE wasabi powder.
I purchased this wasabi powder at our local Shaw's (same as Albertson's) for $2.99.  It is a very practical way to buy wasabi because you can make your own wasabi for sushi simply by adding water and stirring it together in a small bowl or you can add this to mayonnaise, mustard, oil and vinegar or do whatever you please with it.  This powdered wasabi has fresh flavor and it's an easy way to keep wasabi on hand for getting creative.  How about adding a small amount to a rub for seafood or steak?Have fun with this practical grocery item that only takes up a small amount of space in your cupboard!  Or pack it in your bag when you head off for the weekend!
A coworker turned me on to this product years ago.  It works well...takes away bloat and basically cleanses your system.  I drink it in the evening when I know I'm going to be home the next day.  For me it works like this...in the morning I feel the urge to go and you might think that's the tea working.  Nope its after that...you better not be far from the potty.  We call it the bomb tea because well...you drop the bomb.  ;)
With its new-look packaging, Tazo also reformulated the Awake tea blend. The old blend was strong, robust, and biting. It was by far my favorite bagged black tea. The new blend is weaker and maltier; it is sadly reminiscent of standard Lipton tea. If I want Lipton tea, I'll buy Lipton tea; it's a lot cheaper than Tazo.I know that many people found the old blend to be too bitter. Tazo apparently decided that they'd gain more customers than they'd lose if they toned down the flavor. I don't know if they're right, but they've definitely lost me.
Tazo Chai Organic Spiced Black Tea is a blend of black tea, ginger, cinnamon, black pepper, cardamom, cloves and star anise. These items are all organically grown and this creates a sense of purity and clarity of thought.The tea has a delicious rich flavor and is perfectly blended for an ultimate Chai experience. Delicious when you add a packet of Stevia and a swirling of orange blossom honey. Milk powder makes this richer and a dash of cream makes it luxurious.While drinking this tea you are transported to India where Chai wallahs sooth your soul with a cup of spicy tea. Each cup of Tazo tea is an adventure and this tea is especially delicious.~The Rebecca Review
In many languages around the world, "chai" simply means "tea." In India, however, the word denotes a specialty that to tea lovers even in the West is fast becoming what cappuccino already is to coffee lovers: spiced milk tea.Chai comes in a variety of recipes that differ from region to region, although traditionally it consists of a blend of black tea, rich milk, various spices and a sweetner. The spices most commonly used are cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and pepper; Tazo's very peppery Chai adds rooibos, vanilla, star anise and chicory to the traditional recipe.You should always have this tea with real sugar, even if you have all your regular tea without any kind of sweetener, because only sugar will bring out the full flavor of the spices. And if you like your store-bought Chai, maybe you'll one day try brewing chai from fresh black tea and spices, too! Namaste ...
I am simply wild about Tazo Wild Sweet Orange Tea.  This herbal tea is so good.  Granted, you don't have the seeds to spit out afterwards (like you would if you were eating an actual orange) but details, details, details!  This is a great tea to have on hand for guests and is great when served with biscuits.  I am thinking any plain butter cookie, so it compliments the flavor of the tea.  The ingredients, for the discriminating tea sipper are: lemongrass, blackberry leaves, rosehips, spearmint, orange essence -- and other herbs, spices and natural flavors.  All of these flavors go so well together.  You won't be disappointed.
I drink all kinds of non-black decaf teas.  A friend of mine brought some of this Wild Sweet Orange for me to try.  OMG!  Just the smell from the teabag is delicious!  And that incredible taste carries over into the actual brewed tea (unlike coffee, for example, where the beans smell incredible but then you brew them and it's just ..eh.).  It's the smell and flavor of a ripe orange - without any acidity.  It's simply delicious.  Anyway, as soon as I tried it, I bought a box.  And then another.  I love it.
It's wintertime and there's nothing better than a hot cup of tea on a cold winter's day.  Tazo's "Wild Sweet Orange" has been a favorite tea of mine for almost 10 years now. I first got a sip of Tazo when we lived in Portland, OR and I learned from the natives that a hot cup of tea from a local vendor was better than a pair of gloves to keep you warm. I still love "Wild Sweet Orange" especially with just a hint of cinnamon to pick up the flavor.
We buy a lot of herbal infusions in our family because I'm a day in, day out coffee drinker and when I'm not drinking coffee I prefer a non-caffeinated drink.My husband lovesBigelow Constant Comment Tea, 40-Count Boxes (Pack of 6), which I grew up on and he never tried until I suggested it. So when I look for herbal teas for him, I keep that in mind.So an orange/spice tea is a natural choice for him. This is a sweet, very orange-y tea that's nicely spicy. It's fragrant enough to smell even with a head cold and it is a family favorite.Like all Tazo teas, the color is lovely. The scent is orange/cinnamon, the flavor is orange/sweet/spicy. One tea bag works well with up to 14 oz of boiling water.Individually wrapped, I usually keep a bag or two in my purse for when we are some place that offers hot water but no teas that we like.
I got two bags of this tea in a Tazo tea sampler box.Brewing it, it smells pretty intense. Drinking it, it tastes pretty intense. A very strong sour citrus flavor, coupled with an inexplicable slightly gelatinous texture. After a few sips I decided that I did not care for it as it was, and added some powdered non-dairy creamer to the mix, to see if that improved anything.The creamer did not dissolve well in the tea, but rather, it coagulated into little clumps, making the already-odd texture of the tea even more odd, and not improving the flavor in any significant way.Perhaps the moral of the story is that I do not like orange-flavored tea, but I found this particular orange tea to be unpleasant beyond my expectations.
I really like Bell's All Natural Seasoning. What I do not like is the packaging. As far as I can tell, the package has not been changed in seventy years. It is difficult to open. I think the ease with which one can spill a lot of product has some relationship to the lack of any upgrade in packaging.That said, Bell's is my favorite all-around seasoning. I transfer a package of Bell's to the Kamenstein Colored Magnetic Storage Jars, that I have also reviewed, immediately after unpacking. That seems to keep it fresher, and certainly more available for use, rather than spillage.
Misleading.  The reason this is cheaper than the other flavors is that this is a 12 pack, whereas the others are all 24 packs for around $21.  Beware of misleading listings.Also, the cinnamint is probably the weakest flavor.  Even fresh packs (I can tell because of the dates of promotions on the package they sometimes run) can sometimes taste stale.  This is because the flavor of the cinnamint lasts just a few minutes.  Tasting all flavors, the peppermint by far outlasts this flavor and most of the others.  I highly recommend that flavor for a nice breath refresher between brushings or just after meals.Orbit Peppermint Sugarfree Gum, 14-Piece Packs (Pack of 24)
The first tree I ordered was badly scarred by wires.  The company replaced it quickly with a very nice tree that had a great shape.  The ficus is great if you have little natural light.  My apartment is very dark and the tree did fine off of the artificial light.  That said, this is NOT a tree for beginners.  Ficus are notoriously finicky.  They like regular water and the same light conditions day after day.  Each time you vary the routiine significantly, it will drop all of its leaves.  Moreover, this plant was hard to water.  The pot doesn't have enough room for the water to soak in, so I had to use a spray bottle and lots of patience.  It needs to be watered daily.In short: good choice if you just don't have any good light, bad, bad choice for a first Bonsai or if you are forgetful or travel.
Dave's Ghost Pepper Hot Sauce is the hottest sauce i've ever had. All that is required to send your mouth on fire is one drop. I just had a dab and my tongue was on fire.This sauce is made with the Hottest Pepper in the World, The Naga Jolokia.It wasn't so hot I couldn't handle it but i'm sure if I had more than that dab I'd be in for more than I could handle. The sensation from the dab lasted a good 15 minutes.The sauce contains the ghost pepper, hot pepper extract, salt, vegetable oil, roasted garlic pulps and acetic acid. It's a delicious addition to many foods- especially sauces, meat and ethnic foods. Not for people with heart/respiratory problems.Amazon has the best price i've seen on the sauce so far. So, if you like it spicy and you want to try a sauce with the Ghost Pepper in it, I Highly Recommend it... If you can handle it, that is.
Ok I am shocked at my response to this. It isn't that bad for me. I guess everyone is different. It has a pleasant heat and I get NO after heat. Is it hot? Yes, but not too hot. And very flavorful, you do get the fruit undertones.The one criticism I have and it is something to be aware of, the bottle is a normal bottle. This means getting a drop or just a few is virtually impossible. It flows out. It is also a great price. So my advice is try a bottle. It may be too hot, it may not. But surprisingly to me my body handles it just fine.
Well, I guess I'm the fly in this reviewer ointment, but Dave's is the only hotsauce that I won't buy. It has a synthetic quality to it and a flavor that is almost non-existent. This is due to its being made directly from capsaicin extract as opposed to actual peppers. It offers a nuclear level of heat that seems to be a recipe for ulcers in my opinion. According to Wikipedia, its Scoville heat (fire) index rates out 50,000 units which can be contrasted with Tobasco's 2,500 to 5,000 rating. Who needs that much heat? Not me or most human beings. This stuff is lethal. No thanks.
First a warning, if you are not a true chili head, this sauce will overpower you and cause you pain! Dave's insanity products are called insane for good reason, they take hot up a dozen notches to thermonuclear! This sauce could easily have adopted the old Brylcream slogan "a little dab'll do ya" cause this stuff you use one small drop at a time. Just a few drops in a quart of tomato sauce and it was too hot for several of my friends. So heed the warning about the heat. However, if you are a true lover of hell's wrath in your body, this is the stuff! Incredible heat, but it also has a great taste. If you are not faint of heart, give this a try!
This stuff is very hot! It will burn your face off! It also has a sort of Habenaro pepper flavor to it. I love it when my friends come over and find this stuff. They all think they can handle it but boy are they in for a surprise! I don't use it often as it doesn't seem to have much of a flavor. If &#34;Melt Your Mouth&#34; could be a flavor, that's what this would be! You don't need but a few drops.
"Dave's Insanity Sauce" is not to be taken casually or even as a way to add heat to individual servings, this is meant for larger dishes such as a whole pot of chili or a big batch of salsa since one or two drops will make a large amount of food VERY hot. That being said, this does have a really good flavor that adds a nice pepper tangy hit that complements most Mexican or South-Western dishes, but I wouldn't use it in Indian or Chinese style dishes.There are several amusing and somewhat painful to watch videos of people abusing this sauce on various web sites and a quick search will provide you with a lot of hits.Highly Recommended!CFH
O.k., I'm going to offer a counterpoint to all the positive reviews.  I did not like this hot sauce, and I like hot sauce!  This may be good in chili (and I will try it there as soon as I get a chance), but it is not a general hot sauce for your eggs, soup, sandwiches, whatever.It is very thick and has the consistency of tomato paste.  The heat is derived from peppers and "pepper extracts" (read: capsaicin).If you want flavorful heat you can use everywhere, try somewhere else.  I recommend Melinda's Naga Jolokia for one.
Someone sitting next to me at a tacqueria doused their taco with this stuff, just like regular piquante, took a bite, and then paid the price for the next twenty minutes.  Learning from his misfortune, I took a few tinefulls (on the tip of a fork) on my taco . . . not even a full drop as recommended.  Just the perfect amount.  Two hours later, I still feel a nice lingering heat.As for flavor, I think serranos have a better flavor, but this wasn't bad.  I definitely would put a very very small on any food where I wanted that perfect amount of "burn".You also may notice that only people from Texas and California have written reviews.  This sauce really is for people who grew up eating Mexican and Southwestern food.  I don't know if a New Yorker or someone from the Mid West would enjoy this stuff.
Let me start off this review by saying I love spicy food.  If I go to an Asian restaurant, I'm the guy who asks for spicyness at a level 4/5 or 5/5.  Ok.. now that we have that taken care of:  this stuff is HOT.How hot you ask?  If I put a toothpick into it and put it at the tip of my tongue, there is noticeable heat.  When it comes time to eat a meal, I prefer to put a drop or so into my individual portion to get really freakin noticeable heat.  The stuff is no joke.  If you use it like Frank's Red Hot, you will probably die.  100 percent recommended if you like things HOT.
Jolokia peppers are rated as the hotest peppers in the world.  This is a newer entry in the extreme hot sauce category and must be used with care.  I once gave a bottle of a slightly less hot Dave's Insanity Sauce to a friend who claimed he liked things hot.  He used it like he would use his normal hot sauce and almost set himself on fire.  This particular sauce should be used a drop at a time in chili or similar foods until you determine your tolerance.  Keep a cold drink nearby, and be careful not to burn a hole through your chair.
All the other sauces were hot, but we wanted to try this one.  We used 9 drops in home made wing sauce (about a cup of wing sauce).  This is powerful, using as directed is a must.  We started with one drop and worked our way up to 9 drops in a cupfull of wing sauce.  9 drops are perfect for us.  This most definitely has a heat and kick of it's own kind.  If you like HOT and I mean standing on the sun hot, this is for you...but do use it as directed on the bottle and start small.
This sauce is HOT. It is obviously not made for just plopping on your food, more likely mixing in a large bowl of chili (or for pranking your friends). Although this stuff is RIDICULOUSLY hot, it actually has some taste compared to other sauces of similar potency. I has an interesting smokey flavor and tastes like straight-up jolokia. Doing the toothpick test with this is bearable, but the heat sneaks up on you about 2-3 minutes in and it lingers for eternity. Wherever you placed the toothpick will temporarily feel like you actually burned it there. Yeah, its hot!Please know what you are getting into if you buy this. It is a sauce with extract in it and is VERY hot. The especially sneaky part is that the temperature creeps up on you and takes a few minutes to really kick. This is not a sauce you would put directly on your food like tobasco or something. Be warned!
Come on, read the label. One of the manufacturer's suggested uses is removal of driveway oil stains.For the last five years or so, I have always had a bottle of this sauce on hand specifically for those friends who swear nothing is ever too hot. The ultimate gratification comes from watching as they disregard any admonishments that direct consumption of any amount greater than a swab on a toothpick is too much. It is particularly helpful to quiet those who cannot refrain from talking over movies or provide undesired running commentary during sports events. Invariably, for next hour their only objective is to regain the ability to breathe normally. The only downside is this ploy only works once.I like to mix about an 1/8 of a teaspoon with two ounces of regular hot sauce for buffalo wings, or add a dab to any taco sauce, however care is required because you can easily reach a point of diminishing returns as the unavoidable numbing of one's tastebuds makes enjoyment of the food impossible.
My husband is such a fan of hot sauces, I can't believe he even has any tastebuds left. However, this is his favorite hot sauce. People are always bringing him hot sauces from their travels, or giving him unusual ones they run across. This remains his favorite. His gasping, eye-watering, favorite! The warnings are real...do use with caution...even from picking up the (apparently clean and dry) bottle to put it back in the fridge, I've touched my lips later and noticed a burning sensation.
I just tried this sauce moments ago. Someone had brought some in to work and it was being passed around. I love hot food, so I figured I might as well try it. I have not explored any exotic peppers or sauces - just the usual jalapeno, habanero, cayenne, and other ordinary peppers. I'm no expert and would never claim to be, just to be clear. My initial impression of this sauce was "yuck" because it was so bitter and metallic and unpleasant to me. It is hot, yes, but not OMG-I'm-dying hot. Just... hot, and with a flavor-if you can call it that-I would not want on my food. Also, the heat lasted only about five minutes or so, without me even drinking anything.
I put this in the category of 'super spicy sauces' - but - I don't think it is by any means too spicy.Flavor isn't too bad, a sort of smoky tomato base flavor.  More than anything, the heat comes through.This is pretty good for spicing up soups, chilies, etc.  However, not really all that good for spicing up a sandwich or something, not because it is too hot, just don't care for the flavor that much 'straight up.'All said, this is better than your average 'super spicy' sauce.  Most seem to just have the awful capsaicin extract flavor (and nothing else), which to me is inedible due to the terrible taste, not even the heat.  Dave's really isn't bad, but not my favorite either.
This is for very experienced hot sauce eaters only, this is some of the hottest Naga Jolokia sauce there is, a few drops and then there is a delayed reaction of a few seconds before the heat and burn hits you but it will. This sauce can be managed but it demands respect. If your looking for the hottest sauce out there this doesn't even come close to some of the other extreme heat sauces on the market which must be due to the way the make the sauce as the pepper itself is the hottest. The heat overpowers the flavor on this one also.
Joseph's Sugar Free Maple Flavor Syrup is pretty good stuff for putting on Italian cakes or rolls. Sometimes I eat this at night and develop the worst form of gas anywhere. I can't help myself and have to let it "out" constantly, I don't know if something is in here that makes me act up. I was ejected from a concert hall after my stomach couldn't help itself. Just a warning to diabetics or regular sugar eaters, don't try to swallow the whole bottle in one sitting.

Both a great tasting pancake syrup and highly effective laxative! It must be the mallitol but every time I have this I have to go. If you like pancakes and farting this is the stuff you want. I didn't get cramps or pain, just gas and lots of poop. If you want less farts and less pooping then mix it with Vermont Sugar Free syrup which is made with splenda. I do 2 parts Vermont sugar free maple syrup to one part of this and it tastes even better. Vermonts is not that good by itself so it fixes that problem too.
My diabetic brother STRONGLY recommended this to me.  I am not diabetic, but I watch my carbs. I had tried other sugar-free syrups, and they all disappointed me, and I had given up on carb-free syrup (and, thus, on all syrup, because I won't eat that sugary stuff).  But, on the urging of my brother, I decided to try once more.This syrup is AMAZING.  It tastes exactly like the sugary stuff the kids eat.  The consistency is a little bit thinner, but the taste is exactly the same.  Even my kids can't tell the difference.
I found this item by searching on Xylitol Maple Syrup...so when this turned up I made the mistake of assuming that Xylitol was the sweetener and did not check the description to see that it was solely Maltitol. Xylitol would have been a perfect sweetener, but I have had experiences with Maltitol and did not want to risk the intestinal disturbance, to put it mildly.  So now I am stuck with this item (which I will throw away) because Amazon says that this seller does not take returns.  Actually the postage to send it back would not have made sense, either.  So just make sure you were not looking forward to Xylitol.
This is the best sugar-free maple flavored syrup I've found so far.  I've tried 4 different brands before this.  I read the reviews and decided to give it a shot; although the price is too high here on Amazon.  I've found it 4 bucks cheaper elsewhere (although shipping is then added in and here on Amazon I use Prime - which I'm finding to be a bit too costly as well). The syrup however; is excellent.  I'll buy it elsewhere.
Chicory gives this coffee its rich taste, dark color and syrupy body -- I guess, although no other chicory-cut coffee I've ever tasted was this good. Although this coffee tastes very strong and robust, I suspect it has less caffeine than the straight stuff; at least, I've been able to drink a lot of it without getting the jitters.I usually buy mine for some ridiculously low price at an Asian market, but lately they've been out of stock. Anyone know why Asian markets carry this product? I wonder if there's an interesting story behind that...
I was on a low carb diet, and thought I found heaven when I tried the chocolate cheesecake mousse by Sans Sucre.  I used half cream, half water to keep the carbs down, and it would whip up much faster than using skim milk.  I do have a problem with the product since I had gastric bypass surgery--the whipped air in the mousse actually hurts my small stomach (air isn't a bariatric surgery patient's friend).  I'm hoping I'll be able to eat this once again after my stomach has time to heal and adjust.  Keeping my fingers crossed, because this stuff is delicious.
I tried this because it is diabetes friendly.  It makes up smooth & creamy in just a few minutes.  The chocolate taste is not strong.  The serving size is too small for me to be satisfied (but, since I am not counting calories and Splenda replaces the sugar, serving size was not important to me.  I do better with a large serving or 2 to satisfy my yearning, then no dessert for the rest of the week instead of a little, unsatisfactory amount every day for a week:).  Also, I noticed an &#34;off&#34; flavor -- you know it is &#34;diet&#34;.  Even so, I would buy it again when I'm in the mood for mousse, but I prefer my homemade, diabetes friendly ice cream.  Compared to what was on the market 10-15 years ago, this is very yummy.
And you can because its that mild.I'm a chilihead from way back, and a friend of mine turned me onto this stuff so I picked it up and made some Chili Verde. One bite and I was completely hooked. It wasn't what I expected, I knew the serranos weren't going to blow my socks off, but they are barely noticeable. But that sweet and tangy tomatillo and garlic flavor is just right for flavoring dishes like this, or just eating with chips, nobody will complain about the heat...its not there. Also wonderful on homemade fish tacos.You may have to search high and low for this locally, I have one store that carries it and they are always sold out, so buy an extra jar if its available.
This stuff is the BOMB! Dark, Gritty, Sweet, with a bite of cinnamon! We doan need no stinking Hershey's!!! Makes great hot chocolate, great mole, or just savor it by itself as actual "Chocolate Para Mesa."My mole recipe: 1/2 cup flour or corn starch, 1/2 cup cooking oil, 1 Ibarra disc, 1/4 cup minced garlic, 2 Tbsp onion powder, 1 Tbsp cumin powder, 2 Tbsp Chili powder, 1 Tbsp salt, 1/4 cup tequila, 1/2 cup Amontillado (or 1/3 cup merlot and 2 Tbsp brandy). Make rue out of flour and oil, add garlic and spices, stir until blended smoothly. Separately melt/dissolve disc in tequila and wine over moderate heat (do not burn!).  Combine chocolate/alcohol mix with spiced rue and allow to slowly cook down to desired consistency and thickness. Serve over meat and rice.
I too had the pleasure to taste the real deal in Mexico.  I loved it.  when I came home I sought out the real deal here in the states, I guess I did not look very far but I did come up with this pretty good substitute.  I also like nestles brand  Mexican chocolate, I tried them side by side and they are almost exactly the same.I love the texture and I often, more than not, eat it just the way it is right from the bar.  But to make a good Mexican cocoa you need to use a paddle and put the chocolate in the cup, pour over the hot milk and paddle it till it is melted and foamy.  You do not need to microwave it, yuck!  You do not have to put it in the blender, Mexican people, for the most part, do not use blenders for their hot cocoa.  I buy it is the store it is too expensive here.
From Nestle comes Abuelita an excellent hot chocolate for those Fall and Wintry days.  This is sugared dark chocolate with a hint of cinnamon.  Each box comes with six tablets.  The best way to serve is to heat four cups of milk, break up one tablet, put milk and chocolate in blender, and blend approximately one minute.  I have the standard powdered hot chocolate in the cupboard but my kids seem to go for the Abuelita first.  They add one broken tablet and milk into the Cocomotion and in a few minutes they are in hot chocolate heaven.  Abuelita has a homemade dark chocolate taste that is not found in most conventional powdered brands.  This a product that is well worth keeping on hand for those hot chocolate days.
I love this hot chocolate  !  this is just a great drink -- the first couple times I made it I didn't do it correctly and it didn't so good --  You have to nuke the bar of chocolate for 30 seconds in microwave  - and you have to put in blender -- so all ingredients blend  -- if you don't you will have a chalky and that would be sad  --  what I have learned is  put chocolate in microwave --  put your milk in sauce pan and warm it up  -- add chocolate and stir  --  when the chocolate melts put into a blender or I use immersion blender to get all spices blended  --  yeah and then you have the best hot chocolate in the world --  how can you go wrong with big beautiful piece of chocolate ?  all other hot chocolate drinks are kind of boring compared to this  --
Real Mexican chocolate of any version will be much better than mass produced American chocolate simply because the cocoa content is much higher (as w/ European chocolate). This is REAL dark chocolate w/ a little spice and sugar. I do not think it requires any additional sugar when I make it since I want the dark chocolate flavor. I use a whisk and it comes out delicious. I think this is one of the best products Nestle makes and about the only one I consistently purchase. In fact I'm going to try the powder mix version for convenience, but since the chocolate will be further processed, it probably won't be as good. However, it also received positive reviews.

I love to spice up my food whether it is chili, soup, Mexican food,  or some type of meat or barbeque.  This El Yucateco Green Chile Habanero Sauce is wonderful if you like HOT SPICY SAUCE!  This is one of the great hot sauces that doesn't  taste like vinegar.This is a great sauce to use as an additive in other sauces or barbeque sauces to add zest to them.  You can control the dose to get the right flavor.  Sometimes a mixture of two or three sauces comes up with the right combination for a perfect barbeque basting sauce.I included a photo of the nutrition label for your information.  This is a great hot sauce and one of my favorites. If you like spicy food then you will love this one!  Easy does it or you will be saying ouch!
For quite some time, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food.  Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches.  Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, El Yucateco has set itself apart from the others as being one that I do not care for.  It is overpoweringly hot--with a searing heat--and has an odd, unenjoyable flavor.  Although not a terrible hot sauce--I consumed the entire bottle--El Yucateco is a hot sauce that I am glad that I tried, but it just is not my thing.
It gets 5 stars just for the no vinegar part..I like tabasco but I do not love any hot sauce loaded with distilled vinegar, this is fabulous because I get to really taste habanero and no vinegar. I love habaneros they might not be the worlds hottest chili but oh the flavor, If you add this to some roasted salsa (put habs in that for sure) but add some of this if you didn't have any and it would be great. My only gripe is coloring added I know its food coloring but still it didn't really need it.
This was by far my favorite hot sauce until the University of Nevada at Las Vegas released a study identifying this brand as having 0.21 PPM of lead in it along with others - FDA limit for lead in food is 0.1 PPM. It got some publicity so do a search for "hot sauce lead" to read up. Aside from the lead, the use of artificial colors also bugged me. The study concludes that simple adjustments to the manufacturing process, such as washing the peppers, or not using salt from the earth, but rather the sea could remedy the problem altogether. If they're not even washing the peppers before processing them, then they are probably covered in pesticides as well.
For well over a year, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food.  Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches.

I have used El Yucateco Habanero (red) sauce for years, and I love it. Mainly becauseits hot as Hell, and the company makes no apologies for that.This stuff has a mild smokey flavor, without the bite that its big brother has. You canjust pour this directly on chips, in salsa, soups, etc. Its very very good, and muchbetter than Tabasco Chipotle or any other widely available sauce.$2.99 is a great price. Thats what I pay for it locally, but I had to search it out.
What this product needs is one of those jumbo 20-40 oz plastic ketchup-style squirt bottles. Whenever i throw a chili event, I haul out five or six various bottles of stuff. No matter what's on the table, the yucateco gets drained and I'm heartbroken.Its decently hot, but not overwhelming. Doesnt have that hideous acrid vinegar taste that most hot sauces have. Lots of flavor, works with everything, the only way to use it is to upend the little bottle and use a big gob. Basically, anywhere ketchup is good, yucateco is better. I go to wal mart for mine, buy four bottles at a time.
For well over a year, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food.  Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches.  Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Tapatio Salsa Picante Hot Sauce has set itself apart from the others and has become a favorite.  When I was given a bottle of this hot sauce for the first time, as far as I remember, I was just expecting a typical hot sauce--this is not typical hot sauce.  It is hotter than the other hot sauces that I like, but it is not overpowering and does not have a searing heat--more like a peppery heat.  In addition, Tapatio Salsa Picante Hot Sauce has a pleasing, exceptional flavor.  This is a hot sauce that I prefer to use only for special occasions.  It is recommendable.
What a discovery. This is a natural fruit booster that is great on everything from applesto watermelon. Makes a great rib rub, for rimming a margarita, on fish, pork, corn onthe cob, veggie, and in a crab pot or with shrimp. Just an amazing chili lime flavor thatperks up just about anything you can imagine.This is a handy way to add spice where a hot sauce wouldn't work. A 1/10 on the heatscale, nobody is going to complain about this setting them on fire. Available just abouteverywhere at your local superstore for about $1.50.
Maseca Corn Flour, 4.4 lbs.is the real thing for making delicious tortillas.  The only other ingredient necessary is water. Of course, a huge amount of technique is required!  My son-in-law uses it to thicken his wonderful chili.  He gave me the recipe, which I placed in Flavored with Love: Mary Lou's Family and Friends Can Cook.  He's such a nice son-in-law.  He would not want me to tell you this, but he is a great cook.Maseca Corn Flour is made from ground, dried corn. It can be used to make masa harina (dough) for "tortillas, sopes and empanadas, enchiladas, pupusas, guaraches, arepas and atole," the manufacturer says. It is gluten free.The manufacturer (the Gruma) company has been making this fine corn flour for over 50 years.
I remember Wright's Liquid Smoke from when I was a teenager. Now I find that it predates WWI and I have some old Wright's brochures from about 1910 (they carry no date, but quote 1906-1907 testimonials). The product is slightly different than the one I remember from years ago, perhaps because this product is no longer made by Wright's.That notwithstanding, the product performs well in actural use. It also has a reputation among amateur sausagemakers and bacon makers, as the best of the liquid smokes. I use mine in meat curing and sausagemaking. The only decent alternatives would be powdered smoke or a smokehouse.
I am usually not overly impressed with these samplers of specialty cheeses, but I do run a cross one now and again that simply stand out.  This is one of them.  I fully admit to being almost addicted to good cheddar so perhaps this is part of it.  The quality of this cheese, even after being shipped all over the place and from heaven knows where, is absolutely excellent.  My sweet friend Brenda sent me this one and it is going to take some hard work to figure out how to top her on this one.  Secret for you:  I plan to purchase one or two of these myself soon horde it away, and simply not share!  I do recommend you give this sampler a try...you will be absolutely delighted.
I have had great Kona coffee before, and I could tell by the reviews there was a good chance of getting great Kona coffee with this brand. I also read reviews of people who had purchased it more than once and didn't get the same quality product both times. I like to make my coffee strong, but this batch was too bitter for that, so I blend it with a milder coffee. This wasn't what I would call a bad purchase, but I do agree with others that the superlative reviews created high expectations on my part. I am guessing it varies by batch.
I have tried lots of different coffee brands this year, and this one, by far, is the best. Although I usually prefer a light roast, this medium roast is fantastic. There's nothing like Hawaiian Kona. The price is still reasonable for Kona beans, and this brand really is exceptional.I drink it black, so it has to be good. There's no attempt to hide the flavor of crappy beans by over-roasting. Or, even worse, adding "flavorings" to mask an inferior product.This coffee is very fine quality. Recommended.
Yes this is very expensive but it doesn't hurt me when I pay 20 bucks for a bottle. The extract will make or break your recipe. It doesn't matter what brand of flour, butter, eggs, sugar you use but if the vanilla is cheap, it will ruin your creation or make it taste cheap. This is the best vanilla worth the price of saffron. It will taste like vanilla and will make your house smell like vanilla, no alcohol aftertaste. However, the price on Amazon varies so check your local prices before purchasing it. You might not even save anything if you just walk into Zabar's or any baking store.
I have always used good vanilla, never artificial. However, the first time I used Nielsen-Massey vanilla I could tell the difference. Your baked products willalso show the difference.  It seems, only the best vanilla from the island of Madagascar is intense enough for Nielsen-Massey. it has long been the choice of bakers and ice-cream makers, this vanilla adds depth and flavor no other vanilla can match. It has a rich intensely flavored extract.I have also,purchased the vanilla beans which are whole 7&#34; pods, each equivalent to approximately 1 tablespoon of extract; two pods per jar. Pure vanilla paste is convenient to use and infuses baked goods and ice cream with flavorful flecks of vanilla bean seeds.Highly Recommended. prisrob 06-17-13
After using Nielsen Massey's Pure Vanilla Extract I would never be able to go back to using cheap artificial vanilla. There is just such a flavor difference. In fact friends ask me to put double the vanilla in my baked goods because they crave the flavor. I use this in banana bread, chocolate chip cookies, custards and ice cream. Basically anything that calls for vanilla is better with this more expensive brand. In fact, I don't want to run out of it so I currently have four bottles. I guess I can't live without it.~The Rebecca Review
A true vanilla-holic I use this vanilla every day.  I don't even measure I just dump it in.  Love the flavor, aroma, and bean flecks.  I use it in place of vanilla extract all the time. This is a fantastic price for a great quantity. I will be purchasing this again as I'm sure to run out at the speed I'm using it.  Its more of a syrup than a paste really, but it exchanges for extract beautifully.  I usually just take out a bit of sugar from whatever I'm using it in as the paste does contain sugar.
This is my favorite vanilla for baking, by far!!! I love that it is not a thin liquid but more of a thick, syrup consistency, so when added to anything you are baking (especially in quantities that are over and above the quantity called for in a recipe, which is a must for me) it does not alter the end product the way traditional thin vanilla extract does. In addition, like all Nielsen-Massey vanilla products, it has a robust vanilla flavor. Accept no cheap substitute. This is worth the price; your taste buds will thank you.
This is a great price for this much vanilla bean paste and this brand is one of the best.  I'm thinking the average baker would never use this much paste but I bake several times a week and so this goes pretty quickly for me.  I use it in place of vanilla extract but NOT when I want to keep an item really white like my fluffy buttercream icing (I use a clear vanilla extract for that).  I pretty much always double the amount of vanilla I put into a recipe because I love the flavor so much.  The fun thing about vanilla bean paste is you get the attractive little black flecks like you would if you hand scraped a vanilla bean for your recipe.  I use vanilla beans themselves too and I think the paste is just as good.  You won't regret getting this. Great and delicious in poundcake! Yum!
As I believe someone else had mentioned, I put vanilla on my vanilla!  This is my kind of vanilla.  I even open it up sometimes just to smell it!  And it's great in pies.  We also make a vanilla fruit dip and it's terrific!  I am just wondering how I am going to scrape the inside of the bottle to make sure I get every drop of it!  My husband even drizzled some over his vanilla ice cream.  And I have put some in my hot vanilla chai.  Like I said, I like vanilla on my vanilla!  I love that you can actually see the bean specs also.  It's definitely the best I have ever had!
My mother has very few vices when it comes to food. But for a long time, she got these French Twists from Sams Club, the only snack food she every showed a preference for. Then... they were gone. We tried getting her the churros from Taco Bell, but they were bigger than she wanted. These are the original, snack size twists that she loves. I see some reviewers received opened or stale bags, but the ones we got were fine. My local grocery store has started carrying the Barry's brand, but only the new flavors, not the original sugar and cinnamon. Glad to find them here!
Like most country folks, I spend a lot of time trying to get the wild livestock on my property, arrows and atatali tend to be hard to use to hit small critters like rabbits and squirrels, shotguns and .22 tend to be noisy and scare the others making it difficult to get enough to feed the host of people that are waiting back at the house for dinner. This is a real time saver for only a few hundred dollars, I can feed all.  It would be better if it came with the fur and head so I could tan those and make a nice coat, hat or bed cover, after tanning the skin.  The best part of it is now my flower bed is over run with squirrels and rabbits.
My friend at the Wizard's university kept getting banished to the Forbidden Zone for doing horrible experiments to reanimate the bodies of the deceased with dark, evil energies that he could not truly control.  After the fifth escape, he finally listened to me and got about 50 of these.  They are small, so they're easy to store in a freezer and they don't contain enough dark energy in them to tear a hole in the thin fabric that separates our reality from the mystic aether when their tiny frames are shot through with eldritch magic and move not of their own accord but the will of my friend, who forges pacts in blood with long-forgotten dread gods.Zombie bunnies only eat vegetables so you don't need a helmet to protect your brain and 300 of them work just as well as any 50 regular zombies.A GREAT VALUE FOR ANY NECROMANCER
Imagine the horror my son felt as he unwrapped his Christmas present to find this bloody carcass instead of a plush toy. It is NOT fuzzy although it is pink....sorta. More like a greenish red color. There was a stench too!Now THIS after Hostess took away his twinkies (Amazon has been wheeling & dealing in $500 a box Twinkies, so they must be in cahoots with Hostess). This has contributed to his anxiety, which means MORE XANAX to tone that boy down. Very very hard for a 42 yr. old boy to deal with! He did say, however, that it DOES taste like chicken. An icy cold glass of Tuscan milk makes it perfect.
Perhaps I should've looked more closely at the picture, but with my seasonal allergies, my contacts were blurry and I thought I was just looking at a very short haired hare. My three year old son wanted a rabbit for a pet, so I ordered this for his birthday. Overnight shipping, of course. I'm an animal lover and member of PETA, and I ALWAYS order my pets with overnight shipping. Especially during the summer.When they say "fresh" I think they need to be more clear about what that means. I also think they need to look up "whole" in the dictionary, because as my son pointed out between crying jags, this rabbit is definitely missing some of the more adorable pieces.While I'd normally give this a one star rating for ruining my son's birthday, I'm going to add two stars because it WAS indeed delicious: delicate and nutty in flavor.
I've already apologized for my miserable luck at keeping fish and other domestic animals alive ...I've admitted I'm no good with pets ...so stop pestering me already.  When this "fresh whole rabbit" fad caught on, I asked myself, "Could this be the solution to my decades-long run of defunct critters?" And it was. But be warned, I would categorize this little rodent as "less responsive" than most pets. It seems to be most obedient with the "Stay!" command.Pets with heads are overrated.
Nice thick leaves.  We're not talking about Nori seaweed you use to wrap your expensive raw fish and rice with before gobbling them down. Sure, in the past you've had a few sheets of the Nori Seaweed hanging around in the plastic ziplock. Every once in a blue moon you tear or scissors a few strips in a packet of Top Ramen to give it an authentic taste (yuck) look (who are you kidding)Go ahead and order this pack of Welpac's &#34;Dashi Kombu Dried Seaweed&#34; then you have two more stops to make.  Miko &#34;Shiro Miso Non Gmo No MSG added 32.5 oz (bean paste)  and Anjinomoto Hon Dashi (Soup Stock)You will never go down the Top Ramen aisle again.  I double dog dare you...
I have been buying this at a local market but they don't always have it.  I am so glad I found it on amazon.  This is by far the best seasoning for steaks and roasts.  I have used other products before, but when I tried this, nothing compares.  I do not use anything else as this gives the best flavor to meats.  Have not tried it on fish or poultry yet but I am sure it would be just as good.  You will not be disappointed with this product.  Excellent!!
I was looking for Lemongrass "tea" without the tea (green, white, decaf or otherwise)--just basic lemongrass in tea bags.  This is it!  The flavor is lemony without being harsh.  Very smooth, silky and pleasant while at the same time delivering rich, full-bodied flavor.I find it relaxing, easy on the stomach, nice right before bedtime or first thing in the morning.One warning, however: Lemongrass in any form--including teas, spices and foods--is NOT recommended for those who are pregnant or breast-feeding. Details at Webmd
Valerian itself smells pretty bad and the taste...well, the addition of mint makes it better, but this tea is still an acquired taste. I've bought this particular brand of Valerian Mint tea for several years and have found it to be a helpful, natural sleep aid.I heat about 6 ounces of water and let the bag steep for at least 7 to 8 minutes so it's nice and concentrated. When I'm drinking it to help sleep, I have it 30-40 minutes before going to bed. It definitely helps me feel more relaxed and fall to sleep a little easier than usual. Although Valerian is herbal, check with your doctor or pharmacist to make sure it won't interact with any OTC or prescription medications you're taking.
Drank some as soon as I got it. Unfortunately, the flavor is so un-memorable, that I haven't thought of it much since! I do like that I could mix it with any other tea flavor, however, because I do believe that it has beneficial properties. It was sealed in a back in the box, and while that bag is not resealable, I expect that as long as I remember to, I will drink it up before it goes stale. Not sure I'd notice the flavor difference, honestly.
You can compare it to unsweetened black tea, but palpable and soothing.  It is one of nature's best blood purifiers in addition to being great for women anytime.  It's great year round and for flu season, and you can ice it too.  Sweeten it up with a bag of chamomile or red clover. Spearmint & peppermint tea compliment it well too -- or add value to that flavored stuff from the supermarket w/this.You can drink this like water and I can't say enough about how good this tea is for well being, you'll probably instantly feel better.
I read about the benefits of Pau D'Arco tea and decided to give it a try. It's hard to find this tea in the market. The Whole Foods near my house doesn't have it either.The taste of this herbal tea is interesting: it's got a hint of sweetness with a very slight medicinal bitterness. Feels quite dry and alkaline to me. Color is light brown. Not particularly delightful or tasty, neither does it have a strong, captivating aroma like the Japanese roasted green tea - it's just weird beyond description. Reminds me of dried summer leaves. Not unpleasant though; I am still glad that I tried it!
I have asthma and have adverse reactions to many medications other than a rescue inhaler. I looked around for other products to help with my asthma. I tried this tea, it really does help to relieve my symptoms. The heavy breathing is relieved, it gets better every day. I don't need to use the inhaler in the afternoon and I can go longer on just one puff of my inhaler daily. Hopefully my asthma will improve so I will just use the inhaler for emergencies. I use 2 tea bags to make 1 cup, and drink only 1 cup a day. It will take time though, in the meantime I am very happy with this product.
I've a difficult time drinking red raspberry leaf tea in the past. I wanted to try it again during my second pregnancy for uterine health. This time I steeped it in boiling water, added lots of honey, and poured it over ice. It's still not the best tasting tea variety, but this particular brand seems a bit more palletable than some others. As far as it's potency/effectiveness, I suppose I won't know until the baby comes (although realistically I'm not sure I'll even know then).This price is amazing, too. I kicked myself for paying twice as much at a local health food store. I will definitely be buying my next box here instead.
Alvita provides tea of consistent goood quality.  Rooibos is a wonderful tea that stands on its own as a tasty tea, or as a substitute for those of us who cannot have caffeine!!  This tea brews up to a nice dark earthy flavor which I love to drink with cream!!  Delicious!! I like it strong so I brew it with two bags for at least 20 minutes and then reheat.In addition to the delicious flavor, rooibos has health benefits due to a high antioxidant level that some are saying is higher than green tea.
I bought this tea thinking it would taste like a rose. I was only half right. While the rose flavor is still there, you have to really search for it. I think it takes a few cups to do that because this is primarily a fruity tea. After you knock the first few cups down and find the subtle rose flavor, you'll find that it tastes like what a rose would taste like if it were a fruit. Which is basically what rose hips are. After drinking this entire box, I found that I really liked it. I was sad when the box was gone and I do intend to get some more soon.Just as an added note, I feel this needs to be mentioned. If you're like me and like to suck on the teabag, I do not recommend doing it with this tea! The bags themselves are not very thick and will break and you will have an explosion of mushy rose hips in your mouth!
I bought this because I thought I was going to try a cleanse that involved this very specific tea. I've done cleanses before, and I enjoy tea, normally. This very one, however, was like drinking a liquid nightmare. I would plug my nose and try to force it down, but I couldn't do it any longer and ditched it.I didn't want to give it a poor review, because I'm sure this is the nature of this tea. But JEEZY PEETE, I hope no one is drinking this for fun.
Bilberry taste a lot like the berry of similar spelling. To put it straightly it tastes a lot like a slightly tart blueberry. They may be a simplistic view of this tea, but I think that is a universal flavor identification that everyone can agree with. I like tea, and this one is not bad. It is definitely different and I might say worth trying out to see if you like it. Bilberrys are of course high in anthocyanins which is the same powerful antioxidant behind recent health fads as the acai berry and black raspberry.Pros:+Healthy+Unique tasteCons:-Unique tasteOverall three stars. Remember that three stars means it just okay, I am not hammering this product as I am sure some people will very much so enjoy it. If you are taking it for health purposes than I am sure you won't mind the taste at all as it is great tasting for medicine.
I don't tolerate caffeine well and I really miss my coffee and black tea.  Herbal teas didn't do it for me, but Rooibus Leaf Tea looks like coffee and comes as close to tasting like coffee as anything I've found.  I don't know if there's any scientific basis for this, but a cup before bedtime seems to make me sleep well.  This is one herbal tea I really like.  I recommended it to a friend who also had to give up coffee, and I recently included a box of Rooibus in a birthday gift ensemble for my favorite insomniac.
I have used Pau D'Arco tea for a few decades to help my body fight off yeast infections. I always found it unpalatable, the taste was so harsh. A couple years ago, I discovered Traditional Medicinals' Pau D'Arco blend. The other ingredients that they add make it quite pleasant. Then, I discovered Alvita's Pau D'Arco nearly a year ago. What a surprise! It is the pure herb, but tastes much like Traditional Medicinals' blend. It is not my favorite tea to drink, but it is my favorite way to get Pau D'Arco. I find that Alvita teas are always excellent in flavor. I associate flavor with quality, thus I think I am getting a lot of the active ingredient in their brand.
I hate the new version which is watered down with chamomile and not effective at all!  The previous senna one was extremely effective but NO longer available at all.  I stopped buying it as soon as the company added chamomile and it is now useless.  Why do companies change something that already worked in the freakin first place.  What a shame. The box they show on this is the old one but I bet if I ordered it they would send me that crappy new stuff.  Also Amazon needs to offer a Zero star option as that is what I would give this new version-a big fat zero.
I've bought several jars of this and thought it was ok. Lately I've been buying other brands because they are less expensive. I now know this a higher quality oil than most. When I use the Spectrum Oil I can cook at a high temperature and food doesn't burn. I tried the same thing with other brands of coconut oil and the oil starts smoking soon after the pan gets hot. I also prefer the taste of this product. It has absolutely no coconut smell or taste at all. This makes it a perfect substitute for shortening in recipes like biscuits, frosting etc. The other brands I tried had a slight coconut flavor, limiting the recipes you can use it in. If a recipes tastes good with the coconut flavor, I'd prefer to use unrefined coconut oil as I believe it is healthier. I do wish the price was lower, but other than that I highly recommend this oil!
I used this with both of my children when I went back to work and needed to pump enough milk.  I couldn't stand the taste of the mother's milk teas, so this was SO helpful to me!  It worked within 2-3 days.  I did need to take about 8-10 capsules per day, and I did smell like maple syrup (fenugreek smells like maple and with such a high dose it does come out in your sweat), but it was worth it.  Neither of my children seemed to notice/mind, so I don't think it changed the taste of the milk at all.  I highly recommend this for any nursing mothers trying to increase their production!
I bougth this to use while nursing my newborn.  I started taking it when she was 2 days old.  Nursing has been great, she gets plenty of milk & I have no concerns about running out of milk.  This is my 3rd time nursing and this time has been the easiest, i dont know for sure if it's because of the fenugreek, but all i can say is that my baby is super happy.  so i would reccommend it if you are concerend about running low on milk.  Also, i read that this herb also is a great breast health support in general, and can help prevent breast cancer, which runs in my family.  So i will definatly continue taking it even after i'm done nursing!  Plus, i gave 5 stars b/c amazon has the best price for this.  I checked 3 other popular health stores and the best price is online!!
I got this because i heard about it on DR. Oz. I SHOULD have worked more with it. However since I didn't I cannot speak for &#34;results&#34;. However what I can say is that everything looks very professional(bottle and shipping). I didn't have any negative reactions. It doesn't have a negative flavour. I mean all and all I'd purchase it again- if that says anything. I purchased this ages ago and still have the pills laying around. WHEN I &#34;get it together&#34; YES I will purchase it again.With this one there IS an 'interesting' aroma. I read this is a &#34;spice&#34; or what not for food...I'm curious if one eats it how it tastes. Its something I'd like to try in the culinary arena.
My wife got these in the supermarket as one of her websites told her that these will help boost the milk supply during breastfeeding. They were right! when we ran out she was producing 3-4 oz less each day! Not good! I ordered this on amazon and splurged for the next day delivery. Amazon's price of this was the same price as the grocery store. However the grocery store gives you 30 count and this is 180...Can't say what else you would use Fenugreek for, but... it sure helps increase milk supply!
I started taking these pills at the recommendation of a pediatrician. Started out taking 2 pills 3 times a day. I had more than enough milk to feed, supplement 1 oz after each feed and freeze some too! When my son started gaining way (& when I got a little lazy), I backed down to 2 pills once a day & still produce enough milk to feed and freeze.They taste a little strange (herbally...) but nothing I can't get past after taking them.I'd read in other reviews, forums, etc that they can cause the baby to be more gassy, which I would say is probably true for my son. It doesn't seem to bother him though. I also read that another reviewer had been told that your body can get used to them, so stop for a short time and then start again - I think I'm going to try that.
I was taking Fenugreek along with Alfalfa and mothers milk tea for months to increase my supply and I the combo had. Then my baby became very gassy and making our lives miserable. I suspected everything from my food to the supplements. I tried cutting different foods then reintroducing them and no change. Finally I decidedvto read up in the supplements and found that in 20% of babies Fenugreek causes gas and/or fussiness.So the next day I stopped taking it. Now 1 week has passed and not only has my baby's gassiness gone away I oddly feel that I have more milk.I'm sure this works for some so can't say it's bad. Just be aware that this can happen.
I love this tea the taste is really good and it smells good as well my husband and I are year around tea drinkers and also we dont even have to add any sugar ( well I use honey on some teas) but this one you don't need anything extra and I will say it really does work drink plenty of water threw out the day .... And usually in the am you will be cleaning  it out lol ... I didn't have any stomach pains or anything but I eat well also!! I recommend this to any and everyone!!
I plan to make broth in the next few days. It seemed to me that it would be a good idea to add a healthy gelatin to "my creation".100% Bovine Gelatin, 14 oz seems to be an excellent nutritional addition without adding on a "guzzilion" calories or salt.  It matters very much to me that this product comes from grass fed cows. I do not remember the exact recipe now, but I did try this 100% Bovine Gelatin by itself:.. added water and a cooled 1/2 cup of chamomile tea.  The taste was mild and pleasant.  It will neither  overpower nor interfere with a recipe. ...just wanted to write a review to say that  right out of the gate I know that this one is a "keeper" for me! I would like to add an update after I have made my broth!
Better tasting than Knox -- or any other gelatin they sell in the local grocery.I add a teaspoon to a bowl of bone broth. For some reason (either due to overcooking or because of the type of bones I'm able to get) my bone broth doesn't always gel -- which means the gelatin from the bones either got broken down during cooking or wasn't there to start with. So I add Bernard Jensen's gelatin to make up for the lack of gelatin in my broth.The bottle lasts me about a year.
Since I'm on a limited income, I look for the best price I can get, and I make a lot of things from scratch.  Also, I love sugar-free "jello", and that is a primary reason I have gelatin, although I do use it for some other things.  This looked like a quality product at a good price.  Boy, was I wrong!  To get anything to set up, it takes at least DOUBLE the amount of gelatin than it does with Knox gelatin. So much for savings. It does not dissolve to a clear solution, but has a brownish tinge to it.  This may be okay for things that have enough color to mask it, but not for light stuff.  If you use enough to get your solution to jell, the texture is poor and rubbery.  Frankly, I can find nothing whatever to recommend this product.  I'm going back to Knox.
I started loving Oolong tea after I discovered a bottled product called 'Tejava'. That product is over a dollar for a 12 ounce bottle. I needed something less expensive so I tried this 'Prince of Peace' brand Oolong.After a few brewing experiments, I now love this stuff.What I have learned; If brewing as 'sun tea' this type of tea seems to come out very weak. If you put this tea in boiling water, it may come out bitter.I now heat up my water in a microwave until it is, very hot to the touch, but no way near boiling. I then put in the tea bags and let it brew for about twenty minutes (I like strong tea). I have, to my taste, duplicated the 'Tejava' brew at a fraction of the original cost.EnjoyKen
So I wanted to run an experiment to see if spiking insulin levels after exercise induced muscle gain. Since sugar is not really healthy, I decided to use honey since it is purportedly full of healthy nutrients. As pasteurizing inactivates most of the nutrients, I chose organic and raw honey. It arrived in enough bubble wrap to protect the jar from a drop of at least 100 feet. Quite impressive. It took me a minute with a knife to get it all off. The honey itself was pretty hard on top but was softer about an eighth inch in. Taste was perfect. I spent half a day slowly heating it and it eventually became a viscous liquid but after 2 days it appears to be crystallizing again. It's not that bad because I kind of liked the sensation of the honey melting in my mouth, slowly releasing the sweetness. I find that making a peanut butter and honey sandwich is as good to me as any dessert I have ever tried but much healthier. Overall, I am pleased with the honey.
For the past 4 months I have been eating healthy. Everything from having no artificial sweeteners to recording every calorie and nutrient I eat.  After doing hours of research I came to the conclusion all natural honey needed to be introduced to my diet. I was very impressed!!! I typically make a fresh ground almond butter sandwich add bananas, and this honey and it tastes great!Taste: AMAZINGPrice: Not bad, because it lasts a LONG LONG time. You wont use much at a time.Health: VERY GOOD FOR YOUOverall, I would but it again!
Love this product.  I used it during a upper respiratory infection (URI) and tea with this honey really helped me to kick it.  Obviously, I did have antibiotics to assist but the fact is the normal time for URI to clear is about 2 weeks even with antibiotics.  I kicked in one and didn't even have to worry about the chest sputum it cleared.  I do believe that the combination of meds with the natural organic raw honey helped me to recuperate much quicker than normal.All this aside, it is great for teas and to take alone especially if sore throat or cough.  I tastes great. Definitely recommend.
For years I used &#34;the other stuff&#34;.  That is the kind of honey you can see thru.  Then I read about being concerned regarding the country of origin of most mixed honey and decided to give Organic a try.  Its a bit more work to use this, but the taste is wonderful.  The pearly cream color and consistency makes this honey SO MUCH better than the other variety.You need to use a spoon, but its wonderful in the place of jelly on sandwiches.  I like that this is from Canada and US sources.If you are considering trying Organic Honey .. give this a try.  I thought 32oz would be too big of a jar but its alreadyhalf gone.Great  price too.
This is definitely different (even though the packaging looks similar) to the other honey I have boughtY.S. Eco Bee Farms Raw Honey - 22 oz.  This honey is a whole food and avoids all of the processes that are involved with making that other honey that is available on the grocers shelves.I love the raw (spun) kind of honey.  The thickness and the taste of flowers (you can get an idea of what types of flowers the bees visited) give this particular brand a light, floral taste.My bottle had a crystallized layer at the top that was almost waxy.  This added to the flavor and texture and was not a problem.  As others have mentioned, this can be softened by placing the bottle in hot water.  I find that this honey is great on my Udi's GF bread as toastUdi's Gluten Free Whole Grain Bread (1 Case).  A spoonful of the honey is great for the throat and just feels good.Love it.
I had to find a sweetener replacement because agave syrup gave me carb-reactive hypoglycemia and blood sugar issues.This honey is - delectable.I use it:- for raw chocolate syrup - 1 part raw dark cocoa powder, 1 part raw coconut oil or cocoa butter, 1/2 part honey (or to taste)- for healing honey - warm water, a bit of lemon and 1/2 tsp of this honey a day for body-healing properties- for cinnamon toast - spread this plus sprinkled cinnamon over gluten-free breadAll in all, I will for SURE be a regular and buy this again when I run out.NOTE:  the top of my honey looked white, maybe from oxidation on the top layer or moisture in the honey top layer.  But it tasted Fine!Yum yum!
This is great honey - very nice flavor, very mild, great to use in baking, on rice cakes, in coffee or tea... all around great organic honey...  I put the jar in the microwave to make it more runny, because it doesn't come that way.  If you are going to put in tea or coffee, or spread on rice cakes, its fine as it is - but need to make it runny if you are going to bake with it, so you can pour into a measuring cup...
This Honey is awesome. I have been using it for about 2 years as of this post. It is sweet and satisfying. You dont need to use very much and then your craving is filled. I am not a doctor but I have heard from reliable sources that unfiltered raw Honey helps reduce seasonal allergies due to yourbody getting some of the pollen that the bees have on them and then they put it in the honey. That pollen in the honey is like a healthy way to train your body how to fight the pollen. I have been doing many things to be more healthy in in the last 8 years but I can confidently say that I have not had any allery responses in more that 2 years. Even the year before I used this honey I had almost no allergies due to being more healthy, Now I have not had ANY allergy response for 2 or mroe years.
This is the best tasting honey I've ever had.  After checking prices at several local and not so local stores I also consider it a great value.  I will say though that we've started buying 2 of the smaller 22 oz. jars each order instead of 1 larger 32 oz. jar. Including the 99 cents each jar shipping, it comes out a little cheaper per oz.  Not sure why the 22 oz. jar description calls it "gel".  It's the same solid honey as you get in the 32 oz solid.If you're looking for really good organic natural raw honey this is the best deal around.
I have been used to consuming honey which is sparkling in nature. Most of honey we get in supermarkets is not raw honey but  which has been pasteurized (heated at 70 degrees Celsius or more, followed by rapid cooling) for easy filtering and bottling so that it looks cleaner and smoother, more appealing on the shelf. When I looked at raw honey I could not believe why it looked like this. But the taste is awesome, and I have been reading up reviews here as well as online on health benefits of raw homey. I drink with warm water in morning or in raw spoonful. My grandparents had beehives, but I don't remember now how it looked over 35 years ago!This looks thick, but once you taste it you are hooked.
This is the best tasting honey I've had since I was a kid.  Raw honey has anti-viral, anti-bacterial, and anti-fungal properties. It promotes body and digestive health, is a powerful antioxidant, strengthens the immune system, eliminates allergies, and is an excellent remedy for skin wounds and all types of infections. Raw honey's benefits don't stop there. Raw honey can also stabilize blood pressure, balance sugar levels, relieve pain, calm nerves, and it has been used to treat ulcers. Raw honey is also an expectorant and anti-inflammatory and has been known to effectively treat respiratory conditions such as bronchitis and asthma.GO ORGANIC!
I love this product.  It is rich tasting, and full of healthy goodness.  It is USDA Certified Organic so you don't have to worry about pesticide contamination or any of the nasty HFC (High Fructose Corn Syrup} that most other 'honey' is polluted with. This is pure raw honey with all the goodness you would expect from a great natural product.  I use it to sweeten my coffee/tea, put on toast or bagels, sweeten oat meal... etc. etc.  It might just be the worlds most perfect food.
I had not recently tried organic raw honey so I was not sure what to expect, regardless, I did not expect this.  The taste is unbelievable, sweet yet not cloying- nothing else tastes quite like it.  The texture is also a nice surprise in that it's slightly creamy but with more body and texture than a typical processed spread like Nutella.Take a piece of high quality dense bread like Ezekiel bread, lightly toast it to bring out the nuttiness, then liberally apply a swab of raw honey to make a little piece of heaven on earth- delicious!
I went to UK for the first time a couple of years back. My friends introduced me to Marmite as something some people enjoyed when they couldn't afford eggs and bacon. The Mr said it was made from a by-product of beer, I thought he was joking at first.  Spread it thinly on a piece of dry toast, served properly, he demonstrated then handed to me. It was surprisingly strong but I liked it. Savory [or savoury as they would spell it] like bacon or other cooked meats but none of the awful fat or grease. It's not terribly hard to find here since the advent of shopping with the wonderful world wide web, so I have been able to enjoy this in the US as a snack between meals on one slice of whole wheat bread, often a late night sandwich with room temperature cheese and tomato.
Being terribly blunt, golden Syrup is made from cane sugar, like molasses and treacle but unlike them it is light, sweet and wonderful to eat.you can use it like honey but it is slightly thicker and has a sutbly different flavor that i prefer to honey.It can be used in sauces, as a glaze , soaked in breadcrumbs to make a tart, spread on bread for a sandwich or on top of waffles as a covering or...well you get the idea. This is great stuff. a taste from my childhood spread on buttered bread.My only reservation is the price here is a bit dear. I've seen it in specialty stores and even some better grocery stores for about $5 so you may want to look around a bit-but it will be sooo worth it!
In the '70s there was an herbal tea that I really loved from South Africa, but then came the boycott of South African goods and I could never again find it. Recently I did some research and found that the tea was once again available (though not by the brand name I knew) by the actual name of the tea "Rooibos".So I made an order through Amazon... and although the shipping price is a bit high for something so light in weight, I can't complain because the tea is even better than I remember it. For those who aren't familiar with Rooibos Tea, it is very similar to good Black tea in flavor, minus the bitter after taste and minus the caffeine and tannic acid, but with the anti-oxidants and other GOOD stuff. Refreshing and delicious stuff!
I was really excited to try these lollies. Don't be. Most of the flavors taste nothing like their names. They are overpriced and extremely poorly packaged. If you think you are going to get some nice thing like the picture shows, GUESS AGAIN!  They arrive dumped in a plastic bag, which has been dumped in a box and dropped from a great height. For the kind of shipping they want it would be reasonable to expect a better presentation. These do last for a long time, which isn't really a plus since the flavors are nasty. If only they could get together with the people that make Jelly Belly and get some flavoring from them.....
These are wonderful, I have seen them when shopping on a stand at certain stores.  When looking for a nice lollipop I ran across these and couldn't wait to get them.  They last a long time and do not cut the inside of your mouth or tongue.  LOVE THEM!  I didn't get some of the flavors that some listed but I got some nice ones that were not listed. Flavors: Very Berry, Strawberry, Wild Cherry, Key Lime Pie, Coconut Cream Pie, Watermelon, Root Beer, Root Beer Float, Cherry Lime, Lemon Meringue, Green Apple, Licorice, Mango Mania, Strawberry Lemonade, Butterscotch, Grass Hopper Pie, Banana Split, Blue Raspberry, Fruit Punch, Cotton Candy, Rainbow Sherbet.
Barley Malt powder is super healthy, since the sugars are largely Maltose, which do not produce a sharp sugar spike for diabetics.  I have tried just about every one available, and Barry Farms makes the best one of all.  The Barry Farms barley malt powder is sweeter tasting than most others and quick dissolving in milk.  I use it with straight cocoa powder and milk in a blender to make a tasty chocolate malted breakfast drink.  Two tablespoons of this only has 3 grams of sugar.  This is one great tasting health food.
These are super cheap from Berry Farm. You just need to be sure you order enough stuff at one time to make the shipping reasonable. It starts super high, but as you add more items only goes up slowly. These are 'soy flour' so it is likely that they have hulled the soy nuts and made it less good that actual soy nuts with the partial hulls still on them, but the texture is just like a really hard dried bit of bread. They do not soak up fluids much, so you can use them in salads or added to meals without them getting soggy.Very good. Just make sure you order enough in your order to not get ripped off by the high shipping for small orders. Very annoying from this merchant!
This product is clearly gluten free, as it contains only soy. It is also vegan, obviously, so one of the few meat analogs that meets both criteria.It rehydrates well and gains a lot of volume in the process, nearly doubling.  I put a ceramic bowl in my sink half full, like a cereal bowl, then pour in boiling water and cover the bowl with a saucer while it soaks. If I'm steaming veggies I often use the water from the steamer to save nutrients and flavor.I use this mostly in stir fry dishes, where it will readily absorb at least a coating of flavor and of course gluten-free soy sauce.It has one of the most pleasing textures of any TVP product I use.  I recommend it.  Be aware that other, flavored TVP products may contain gluten, this one has never bothered me.  It probably has a shelf life of several years as it is very well dried.I'd love to also buy a slightly larger chunk size for variety.
I tried so many different ways to pop this like I had seen on &#34;Bazar foods&#34; and I am not having a lot of luck. I have found a tablespoon of coconut oil in a microwave popper to be the best so far but I still have a poor popping ratio of only about 50%. I love the sweet nutty flavor and crunchy texture but with such a large % of un-popped berries it is not really cost effective. I may give it a try again this summer as I purchased some seed to plant and will harvest my own.
These are good quality pumpkin seeds. Virtually all of the seeds are whole seeds (vs. some companies where the seeds are broken and cracked). I have no complaint about the seed quality, but the shipping costs from this seller are high even if you order a number of items together. Ordering just one or two items is out of the question because shipping costs are so high. On the plus side, the costs for many of their items are very low, so it can cancel out the high shipping. Be aware that if you order more than one item at a time in the same order, shipping is reduced on a per item basis, so take that into consideration when you see over $10 shipping for a couple tiny items!
This "Better Than Bouillon" is my wife's secret weapon when making her signature Chicken and Pepper stir-fry. This is made from real meat stock and comes as a paste, which is much easier to work with than the bouillon cubes.This can be used anytime a chicken stock base is needed, but it can also be used in place of other spices when cooking. To bring out the the flavor of the chicken in stir-fry, the paste can be added directly to the meat while cooking and then, once the meat is browned, she adds the recommended amount of water. This makes the chicken flavor very pronounced and is one of our favorite quick dishes.Highly Recommended!CFH
No, this stuff doesn't beat boiling chicken carcasses, but it comes pretty close. Regular chicken bouillon can't compare. Mix this stuff with chicken breast, noodles, vegetables, and spices and you get a very good chicken soup. A crock pot/slow cooker really shines on this kind of dish.The problem: I live in Hawaii, one of the most expensive parts of the country. The most expensive grocery store sells this for 6.59. I buy it for 4.79. Usually Amazon shines on this kind of thing, but not with the Better than Bouillon series.
I love Amazon and I buy a lot here every month including many Subscribe And Save items but this is nuts.  I also shop Walmart on line.  I have two windows open right now.  One for Amazon and one for Walmart.  I'm looking at an 8 oz jar of Chicken Better Than Bouillon for $3.44 delivered free of charge to my door from Walmart.  Why would anyone pay almost 4 times as much on Amazon?????  I guess it really pays A LOT to comparison shop.  Based on reviews here, I'm going to try this bouillon because it sounds really good.  I haven't tried it yet so just letting you know the 2 stars is because of the price...not the product quality.Update:  Bought the base from Walmart on line and tried it.  It's good but not any better than others I've tried.  I think I like Wyler's a little better.
I used to depend on the powdered bouillon for cooking--or the little cubes.  No more.For chicken bouillon (or vegetable or beef), I now use this product. "Better than Bouillon" is much richer and has a far more textured and better taste.Something like this is often called for in recipes.  This is so much preferable to the cubes or powder that I would recommend to anyone using those to give it up. There is no comparison.Even better, of course, is using stock.  But for many people, that might not be an option.  Short of that, this product does well enough to work and is so much better than what I used before.
There is not much to say about it. I used this to make soup. It gives the soup a more natural taste and does taste pretty good. I bought this because it was organic made and the description said it was lower in sodium than the typical Boullion Cubes. For those watching their sodium intake this contains 680mg of sodium per serving. 1 tsp = a serving. The typical boullion cube is about 850mg. Its not a big difference but considering it taste better than boullion the lower sodium is a plus. They also make a reduce sodium version that has 500mg of sodium.Here are the Ingredients this contains:Chicken Meat and Natural Juices*, Salt, Cane Sugar*, Maltodextrin*, Natural Flavor, Dried Onion*, Potato Starch*, Dried Garlic*, Turmeric* and Spice Extractives*.It does contain Maltodextrin but since this is made in the US the maltodextrin is derived from corn starch. So if you suffer from gluten intolerance you should be fine.You might be able to find it cheaper locally.
We've been using the Superior Touch Better Than Bouillon Beef Base for several years now. As the name implies, it is indeed better than bouillon. It creates a very tasty broth. And we've used it to enhance the flavor of roasts and beef stews. I've also put it in the water that I use when I boil brown rice to give some flavor to the rice. it works well for this. A little goes a long way. One teaspoon makes a cup of broth. I definitely prefer it to any powder beef bases. The one caution I have is for those who must watch their sodium intake. One teaspoon provides more than a quarter of the recommended daily sodium intake.
This and the other Superior Touch concentrated flavor bases are now the only ones I'll buy. I do look for them locally, though, having found early on that they are available for much more reasonable prices in supermarkets even here in the boondocks.I have found the flavor superior to any other form of savory base (except that I've made from scratch) I've used over the many years. But I found out the hard way not to salt anything I use it in. For example, I just made a batch of basmati rice with a wonderful flavor simply by adding a spoonful of this before heating the rice and water, and stirring. The clump dissolved fairly readily, especially as the materials began to heat. But when done it needed no added salt. I've found that even the "reduced salt" varieties I have of this brand are 'way salty, presumably as a preservative. That, of course, makes sense to me as salt has been used that way historically.
I've been eating low carb for over a year. Some things I really miss. I'm no chef, and all the canned soups were out of range. These Better Than Boullion products were praised on a forum, so I gave them a try.How wonderful! Easy to prepare, simple to add in real meat and other ingredients. I have also used tiny amounts to flavor omelets.  It can also be used to make a gravy or seasoning to marinade a roast, for example. If you are sick of boxed drinks and bars, this is a wonderful addition. You can add real cheese or meats for substance, too. Perfect for cold weather, and lasts a LONG time!
I came on to see what other reviewers posted about this maaaaaaaaahhhhhhvullllous pantry staple of mine.  I was surprised to see the notes about saltiness...I haven't had a problem with that.  Maybe my palate (I almost typed pallet) is off or maybe sense I tend to not add a lot of salt, this covers me?  I dunno.  I was especially surprised to read that it contains MSG.  MSG gives me a ferocious migraine and I have yet to fall ill after using this...all that to say &#34;I don't care whay y'all say...I LOVE this stuff!&#34;I will agree that it is a little pricey :).
I've been buying this product at Costco for years.  It is a fantastic product.  Lots of great beef flavor, not just salt like a bouillon cube.  The uses for this product are virtually endless.I saw that this product was a few dollars more than Costco, but with the free shipping, what the heck... save a trip to the warehouse madness.  I should have paid attention to the size.  This is about 1/2 the size of the Costco version.  Because this review is based on the product, not the price, still 5 stars.  But I won't buy it again here.
This came to me packaged very well in protective bubble wrap and I was thrilled to get it.  I am crazy about ham & beans and have been making it in my crock pot for years. I just used this Ham Base for the first time and will never be without it again.  What a delicious difference it has made in my beans!!!  I am eager to make split pea soup now.  It's nice to know that putting a ham bone and meat in it isn't a "must" because of how good Better Than Boullion tastes.  Authentic ham flavor. Love this product.
I was yearning for collards/turnip greens and couldn't justify buying a hunk of ham for just 2 people. So, I thought I'd try this.........it's just wonderful! Smokey and not terribly salty.....great meaty flavor ( although  it's mostly vegetable). My family are MSG sensitive, so I'm careful, but this has none added. And BOY! Did it make a difference! Can't wait to make split pea soup, and purple hull peas, and.....We stirred some into canned brown beans and they were SO much better! It doesn't take much, either........ great stuff. Well worth the $12.00.
Big fan of Better than Bouillon, their entire product line is first rate.This stuff is indispensable. I found out I was allergic to something used inthe curing process for ham hocks, and was pleasantly surprised to find thisham base right next to some of my other favorites like lobster and turkeybase.Anyway, for a pot of beans or turnip/collard greens this stuff just cant bebeaten, and without all the fat from hocks or bacon. Also great in soups butmy favorite is for making Red Eye Gravy for biscuits and grits, beats theheck out of using all those pan drippings and tastes just as good.
I love Lobster Bisque. No - I REALLY LOVE Lobster Bisque!! I go visit my sister in Provincetown, Mass. and there  used to be a restaurant there that made the BEST Bisque EVER &#60;they have closed in the last year&#62; SO I did a lot of searching and found a recipe that called for Lobster Base &#60;of course I could have used Bouillon&#62; and no stores in my area had it. So I came to Amazon and knew I'd find it.This base is PERFECT for Lobster Bisque! It came a week earlier then expected so that made his purchase even better!My parents came for a visit and my father and I love Lobster Bisque so I was able to make it the morning they got here. He LOVED it!!That alone made this purchase so worthwhile!! I will definitely purchase this again when I run out of the jar I got. 8 ounces will go a long way!
Mine!OK, so now you know my secret so I might as well tell you that anchovy paste is alsocritical. Send me some royalties awright!I have to laugh at the negative reviews for this wondermous stuff, you're not supposedto eat it with a spoon, its a concentrate you nimrods! Sheesh.I also use this in gumbos, and recently tried it in some homemade vegetable soup and guesswhat.... it was GREAT!!! Very versatile, I can imagine any number of uses.Better Than Bouillon has a great product line, and this is the Flagship. No kitchen shouldbe without a jar of this, and it lasts a long long time in the fridge. Seriously, whats tocomplain about?
This is a very economical product if you cook a lot and need vegetable stock or bouillon. I've been trying to add more meatless meals to our menu, and this tastes very good. I made some minestrone soup that smelled and tasted delicious.I can't speak to any MSG problem. I'm sensitive to it and avoid it, but this didn't cause me any problems. The ingredients are vegetables, and concentrated vegetable juices (carrots, celery, onion, tomato, and onion, potato garlic (dehydrated), hydrolized soy protein, salt, yeast extract, sugar, Maltodextrin (from corn), soybean oil, spice extractive. One serving provides 28% of the daily recommendation for sodium.One jar makes 9 1/2 quarts of stock.
As long time vegetarians (more than 30 years) you get to know products that are meat free.  My wife is the most wonderful cook in the world, making soups that people would die for, and of course veggie soups need a little adder at times.  She regularly uses Marmite, which adds a nice rich meaty flavor, but she absolutely swears by the Better Than Bullion string of products with the Vegetable Base a favorite.  I must say that her soups are absolutely amazing, and I think this base is a significant adder to those culinary delights.  You can't go wrong with Better Than Bullion products.
I have used this product for years and would be lost without it.  It not only works for any and all recipes that call for chicken stock, but it is also great for adding chicken flavor to things like mashed potatoes, rice, etc.  It is very handy for the "flu" season when you just want to hunker down with a cup of chicken soup.  For those times, I make a cup of chicken broth using this product.  Sometimes, I add leftovers from the fridge... rice, vegies, chicken.  The other flavors are also very handy... adding distinct flavors to your cooking repertoire.
We regularly use chicken stock in recipes, and usually buy an organic version from the grocery store.  It's a bit pricey, but we like to reduce our exposure to non-organic chicken as much as possible.However, we got tired of the high price of such stock, and went looking for alternatives.  We found this base, gave it a try, and LOVED it.  It's a concentrate, so it takes up much less cabinet and refrigerator storage, and it dissolves quickly and easily in hot water.Also, this is one of the few products that we don't buy via Amazon Prime even though it's available, but it's currently available for half the Prime price from other vendors, and you can get multiple jars for one flat shipping fee, which makes is significantly cheaper than both the Prime version and also cheaper than the stuff we get at the grocery store.Put it all together, and this has now become one of the staples in our kitchen - love it.
Oh, this was heaven at first bite!  It is the exact cheese that Kraft uses in their little boxes of macaroni and cheese.  I never liked the little noodles they used though.  It is so delicious with regular (Anna's) elbows.  Just add a touch of vegetable oil, a touch of milk and this powdered cheddar with a pinch of salt.  I have since purchased a different brand of powdered cheddar and it is no match to this brand.  I will buy this brand from now on.
While this maybe more versatile it is definitely not cheaper than buying boxed mac and cheese. The only benefit you get is that you get to pick what kind of pasta you use it for. When i got this I thought this would be great to have, now i can make wheat pasta with this mac and cheese. That was the only benefit....This powdered cheese is in my opinion too expensive and not natural or organic or anything of that nature. It is exactly the same cheese youd get in the Kraft box. It has yellow dyes in it and all the other chemicals and preservatives ...Do yourself a favor spend the extra buck and buy the Hodgson Mill Wheat Mac And Cheese Dinner. No dyes no artificial colors or flavors. Its whole wheat pasta and white cheddar cheese. Its not half bad either for a wheat pasta but none of the artificial stuff like this cheese.
I live in California and we arguably have some of the best cheeses in the world out here. I'm originally from New York where I worked 4 years in a Sicilian restaurant, and my taste buds prefer whole milk products with low salt. I've tried a lot of dried cheddar cheeses in my cooking and baking, but I have to admit that this cheese powder from Ohio of all places is the best I have ever used. I am 50 years old, but I also have to shamefully admit that by adding a teaspoon of this cheese powder to the mix, I am once again like a little kid and I now occassionally enjoy a box of Kraft macaroni & cheese.
This tastes like Kraft's mac & cheese. If you buy this and some elbow macaroni, you'll have the world fooled into thinking your dish came from a blue cardboard box.But hey, I enjoy boxed mac & cheese, and I enjoy using this cheese powder with other types of noodles to make shells & cheese or linguine & cheese. Perhaps I could even mix it into a white sauce and make nacho cheese.But the further away I went from mac & cheese, the less enjoyable I found this powdered solution to be. For example, I tried using it to make my favorite broccoli cheese soup, and the results were so disappointing I didn't even eat all of it. This definitely cannot replace regular cheddar, but it sure can make a quick and easy, cheesy meal.
i was a bit skeptical at first but it's a wonderful addition to eggs, chowders, anyplace you want a cheesy flavor that tastes like cheese and not a chemical. plus it is not salty. it's a true cheese flavor. this is a must have in my kitchen. just adding this: you can mix it with a buttery spread for a new twist on garlic bread, bake it in the oven for a few minutes, bread wrapped in foil at 350. my company could not get enough. i'm sure i'll come up with more uses. stay tuned.
I bought this for popcorn after reading all the reviews. To keep it short here, it's way too salty, so you have to use just a little, then you can't taste it because all you can taste is salt. Then there's that super artificial bright orange color which is not at all close to the color of most cheddar cheeses. Too artificial looking. To sum it up, I do not recommend this for anything. Can't imagine putting on pasta for mac & cheese! Way too salty! Ick!I will continue my search for cheese powder.
just a word of advice to those of you who are considering BULK ORDERING this product...it does NOT store well...! if you order more than you can use in a few SHORT months, make sure that you have a DRY and preferably vacuum-sealed environment in which to store the unused portion.i bought a couple of lbs of powder and used it a couple of times...stored the extra lbs in a kitchen cabinet in their original packaging...months later, the UNOPENED bags of powder were as hard as rocks...!
We eat a lot of popcorn. I mean a lot. We buy it in 50# bags - just the two of us; the wife an I. I like flavors on my popcorn, and use garlic butter, Parmesan cheese, and other flavors. This cheese powder seemed like just the thing for a great flavoring on my popcorn. But, I was wrong. I tried it once. The bag is still clipped shut in the cupboard. The texture was gritty, and more stuck to the bowl than the popcorn. The color is more intense than the flavor. I didn't find it to be that cheese flavored popcorn I imagined.I told my wife to use it up in other dishes that could use a bit more cheese, but I don't think she is too thrilled to try it again. Live and learn.
I'm telling everybody about SweetLeaf brand stevia clear liquid. Unless you use too much, there is no bitterness. So go easy. I use 6 tiny drops to a cup of coffee. Our iced tea actually tastes better with liquid stevia than it does with sugar. Surprising! Now I use it in a lot of cooking. When baking, use applesauce to replace the bulk of sugar (experiment with it) and then add stevia (we use one teaspoonful of clear liquid stevia for one cup of sugar). I will not use artificial sweeteners because they are not safe. It was a happy day when I discovered stevia.
I was looking to stop using Splenda and other artificial sweeteners.  I also, while not a heavy drinker, was looking for something I could use to sweeten drinks instead of simple syrup which, of course, is sugar based.  I saw this on Amazon and wondered if I could not only use it in my tea, but if several drops would work in other drinks.  IT DOES!  So I use it in my green tea each day and add a few drops to your favorite cocktail and cut way back on any calories that would have come from another sweetener/mixer.  LOVE IT and keep an extra bottle around always. Yes, it's pricey but each bottle lasts months so it really isn't nearly as expensive as you think.
My whole family loves this sauce. I use it primarily to recreate a dish we had in Maui. It adds a wonderful sweet and spicy flavor to just about any sauce. Service on this order was spectacular. Several bottles arrived broken and replacements were received within days. Amazon service was fast, easy and reliable. I love Amazon. Also, there are many recipes that you can look up using this sauce that a very good. It goes spectaculary with coconut milk, vegetables, chicken or shrimp and pasta. We love it.
I love Mae Ploy Sweet Chili but I prefer more heat.So I buy the following, http://www.amazon.com/Mad-Revenge-Habanero-Chile-Extract/dp/B0032ETK3O/ref=pd_sbs_gro_4, which allows me to add as much heat as I like.I pour the chili extract into an eye dropper bottle, http://www.amazon.com/Amber-Glass-Bottle-glass-Dropper/dp/B004TS3NOO/ref=sr_1_1?s=hpc&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1362368052&sr;=1-1&keywords;=eye+dropper+bottle, which allows me to control the amount of chili extract that I add.The chili extract lasts forever (years), however, be very careful regarding the amount that you add to the Mae Ply Chili Sauce, the chili extract is fiercefully hot (read the directions) and the eye dropper allows you to add drops of chili extract until you reach the level of heat that you prefer.
I read the nine reviews that preceded me and wondered how a product depending on a person's taste could consistently receive five stars.  Is something suspicious here?Nope!  Here's the tenth five-star rating in a row, and I'm tough.  This is the best sauce of its kind (or any kind) I've ever had; and I'm an old guy who's been around.  Just the right sweetness, just the right hotness.  I'd love to soak a chicken in it, as well as dip egg rolls and chicken nuggets.These big bottles won't last and I'll be back for more, fer shure.  Absolutely more than worth worth the little price, this stuff should be standard in every home, along with plumbing.And my sincere apologies to those other reviewers for doubting you.
Oyster sauce is one of my very favorite flavors in nearly every Asian dish I make.  I'd previously read that Lee Kum Kee is one of the best manufacturers but hadn't been able to find it in my area grocery stores.  What I usually buy is in a 5-6oz bottle and costs $4-5.  This brand adds just the right flavor, and it's definitely cheaper for the large bottle(s) than what I've been paying.  I keep it on the fridge door along with the sesame oil I purchased on Amazon.  Just typing about this is makes me wish I had some leftover Chinese food!
Starting on this while I was pregnant as I had a b vitamin definiency with anemia so I started add this to everything (and took floradex) and it help a ton with my iron number as they go hand an hand. Anyways I love the taste of Frontiers Nutritional yeast and sprinkle it on my eggs every morning it taste like a powdery cheese which is really good if you have enough butter on your eggs to make it all moist or you can use coconut oil (which is what I usually cook my eggs in anyways). This is the highest quality Nutritional yeast available due to there processing methods! Highly recommend this brand, the yeast is almost a powder form for the mini flakes so if you don't like powdered form you can buy it in large flakes also from Frontier.
I am new to being on a plants only diet.  I did some research before buying Frontier Brand.  I knew it would be small pieces, so no complaints here.  I find that makes it easier to blend together when creating sauces.  It is a learned taste, but I regularly sprinkle it on everything now.I only buy it here due to the reasonable price.  I wish it was a subscribe item.  I would buy it in a larger size if it was available.I keep "cheesy" sauce in my fridge to put on many things, pizza, quinoa, stir fries and tortillas.  The right recipe and you have a wonderful mac 'n cheese!
I use to consume Yeast for folic acid. Lewis Labs was the best till few years ago Russian chose to play with it since it became so valuable for the production of their alcoholic beverages. After the fermentation process is completed the yeast is harvested, thoroughly washed, pasteurized, and dried on roller drum dryers. The B vitamins are both naturally produced during fermentation, and added to the cream prior to the drying process. Riboflavin (B2) and Cyanocobalamin (B12) are created during fermentation. Additional Riboflavin (B2) and Cyanocobalamin (B12) are added after fermentation along with Thiamine (B1), Pyridoxine HCL (B6), Niacin and Folic Acid. Infact what this bag contains yeast and supplements, where I could care less for unregulated business for supplements.Frontier is a superb brand but no need to consume supplements. There are other brand that they sell without fortified supplements, just pure yeast for much less in price but trusting the source is the real issue since majority of these yeast are from outside US.
I used to buy the Kal nutritional yeast flakes, but when those went off Amazon Prime I decided to try out this brand. I'm very happy that I did and I will only be getting the Frontier brand yeast flakes in the future.I use nutritional yeast mainly in vegan cheese recipes. Compared to the other nutritional yeast flakes I've used, I believe this one has the best flavor. As other reviewers have pointed out, these flakes are much smaller than other brands I've used and are more like a powder. However the difference in size/texture hasn't seemed to make any major difference in any of my recipes.Overall, these yeast flakes have the best flavor I've tried to so far and I will continue to buy them in the future.
Having this flake salt on my table isn't a big deal, but when I sprinkle it on my food, it's a burst of sea saltiness that I enjoy very much, and I know I'm also caring for my health, in one more small way. I'm the only one who uses it, so the two boxes last a long time, and I'm almost out, so I just ordered more. I have other sea salts for other uses. I just realized lately that this one makes an awesome salt to coat the rim of my margarita glass....also healthy, made with organic fruit juices and 100% agave tequila. Life is good :)
It has interested me for many years that in a society where we know sodium contributes to health issues, our supply of assorted gourmet salts is increasing.  In all honesty, for average cooking as in salting water or soups, I grab the old standby of Kosher salt,  For applications where the salt is added after the preparation, I often add Maldon Sea Salt Flakes from the UK.  My arsenal includes salts from all over the world, but there is something about this one that is my favorite when chocolate items are finished off with salt.  Caramels made with salt really pop when the Maldon is used.  I've had Maldon sea salt flakes in my cabinet for many years and doubt that I'll ever be without it.  It's that good.
I don't know why I have always resisted buying this for so many years, I don't know if the term flake put me off or what but it is SO good. You crush it between your fingers and sprinkle over food. I think this goes great whole on top of sweets like chocolates or cupcakes for the salted caramel flavor - you get a flaky salty crunch that is awesome. I think its great for cooking with as long as you break it down with your fingers, we keep it in a salt box on the counter and it is all we use now.
I love salt. I would not eat it out of the box but I add a lot of salt to my food and this salt is fantastic. The taste is lovely and the crunch is great. I have been using it solely on desserts thus far and I works so well with my salted caramel chocolate torte. A sprinkle on top of the chocolate top makes a world of difference. It did not dissolve or get watery the way regular salt or even other sea salts would have. It stayed crunchy and whole to the end. You cannot go wrong with this salt.
I bought this partly because my pink Himalayan sea salt, while fine for cooking, has a tendency to coat my fingers when I pinch it to spread on food. Salt flakes sounded like a better idea.I was right. These salt flakes are more coarse, perhaps a bit larger than sesame seeds but certainly not on the level of corn flakes. They taste fine, have a very nice texture while pinching, and give a delightful crunch when chewed. It's tough to argue with all this.The container has a certain d&eacute;class&eacute; air about it and would be right at home in a French bistro, so you might not feel a need to get a salt box. One would be advisable anyway, just in case, since box can't easily be used as a dispenser once it starts to empty out significantly.
Slate Magazine has a review on table salts and this was the winner.  So I ordered some from Amazon and compared it myself to the brands available where I live, including Celtic Sea Salt.  There is no comparison... Maldon is the standout winner. It is big flaky, crunchy pieces of very tasty salt.  This is not a baking salt.  It is more of a finishing salt to go "on" foods.  It's wonderful on avocado, steamed yellow squash, baked potatoes... etc.  The Slate reviewer said he loved it the best on chocolate H&auml;agen-Dazs ice cream!  It's that good.
I really thought I would love this salt;  I really tried to love this salt:  I am just not a big fan of this salt.  This salt puts the Sea in Sea Salt (more so than other sea salts) -and for me that equates to a C in flavor.  I really get an 'ocean aftertaste' that I do not care for.  Perhaps this salt would go well with sea food, but since I don't eat a lot of sea food it is not for me.  Another disappointment for me is the loss of crunchiness when this salt touches anything moist;  other salts seem to be able to hold onto their crunch a little better.  I will raise this review if I find a food that embraces this salt's uniqueness to my liking.
I love this salt!And for the reviewers concerned about it not melting quickly... it's not supposed to. It's a FINISHING salt. It's a complete waste to cook with it, plus it's hard to come up with equivalent measures if you were to use it when cooking in place of kosher or table salt.  But sprinkled on a rib eye fresh off the grill, on a pan seared salmon filet just before you serve it, on roasted aspargus right out of the oven, or even over a fresh, crisp apple half - it's "Na" heaven! If you already use finishing salts, you know what difference they can make. And if you're not, it's an easy way to take your dishes to the next level. Bon appetite!
Greetings! I like this salt because it is a status symbol. If I put this salt on the table everyone will know I have excellent taste and refinement. In any case, if Maldon is good enough for the Queen it is good for sure! Not only because she is a Queen but because grandmothers just seem to know what is good to have in the kitchen. I take a pinch of Maldon salt flakes, crush and sprinkle on foods. Makes the food quite tasty. The texture of Maldon salt flakes is neither too hard nor too soft. Seems just right. I recommend giving Maldon Sea Salt Flakes a try. Cheerio!
I sprinkled this on my cats  food to help their appetite, entice them to eat more. It's supposed to taste like cheese. Cats are supposed to love it. They didn't. I read where some people use it in place of cheese. I tasted it. Whoa.....no wonder the cats didn't want it. I donated it to a neighbor who used it. She loved it. Go figure. I guess we're all born with different taste buds. Mine say no to nutritional yeast! Your buds may care to differ!
This stuff is really great. It's very messy but of course what oil isn't. I like to use a scoop and a spoon to avoid most of the mess, but liberal use of paper towels is still recommended to prevent getting oil over everything. It seems to thicken and thin depending on the temperature but this doesn't effect the quality of the popcorn. Between this, good quality large kernels and some Flavacol salt, you get the best recreation of movie theater popcorn (less the liquid butter stuff, but you can add that if you prefer). Popcorn comes out a perfect speckled golden color and has a nice butter flavor. Highly recommended.
When searching for premium popcorn for the Little Bambino popcorn popper we won, I bought a red popcorn just for fun. I'm sorry I did.The kernels of Wabash Valley Farms Vintage Red popcorn were stale. They were dried out.You can't directly control the moisture locked in the dry kernels; only the manufacturer can. If there is not enough, the kernels don't pop big enough, they stop popping early, there are a lot of unpopped kernels, and the whole batch burns while you wait for the final slow pops. Popping produces steam, which prevents burning. No steam, no heat control. No heat control, burned popcorn.A few of the kernels were perfect. They tasted great. The red color was entertaining. But, just a few.Try another brand.
I was looking for a hulless popcorn (due to my diverticulitis, boy do I miss popcorn) and tried this based on the reviews. I was disappointed that this has way to many hulls for ME (the hulls do not disappear or get so small) but the flavor of the popcorn is amazing, very very tasty, my family loves it so I will buy it again.  We air popped it, sprayed it with a little cooking oil and sprinkled some popcorn flavored seasoning "butter."  Hardly any calories but lots of taste :) They are tiny when they pop so you really should not flood it with anything heavy or it will turn to mush.
this is great tasting popcorn its perfect tasting the only problem is in my air popper it doesnt pop all the kernals like your purple and baby white and yellow do  this red kind pops about 75% 3/4 of the kernals and leaves unpopped about 1/4 or 25% thats too much wasted and i will buy the other kinds like the purple thats the best and pops over 90% of the kernals  with less than 10% wasted i still recommend this though if you use another popping method im sure its perfect  air popping is very different than stove top or microwaved  so try it if you use those methods its delish!
Whenever I'm stuck for a gift for my wife, nothing beats 2 1/2 pounds of Almond Roca. And I'll give her more credit: much as she loves this toffee treat, she has one for dessert after dinner, and that's it. If I were to sit down with this, it wouldn't last a week. If you've never tried Almond Roca, but love toffee, then you've got to get the original "mini" chocolate and nut covered toffee. If they only sold self-control!
You will always find these in Chinatown because Chinese people and Filipino people love these, and why not?  So buttery is the toffee!  The little nutty covering feels funny on your tongue and I think they just put it there to keep the toffee from being sticky as it does not contribute much to the overall flavor.  These are not the deformed ones that they sell cheap--each one is beautiful and perfectly-formed.  Buy a can for yourself and any Chinese or Filipino friends you have, and even for your girlfriend for Valentine's--the pink tin practically SHOUTS "Happy Valentines Day, I love you like a little toffee candy!!!!!"
I'm a toffee nut. At Christmastime, my wife bought a 28oz can of these for me and they lasted all of about, oh, one week. So I reordered, this time getting the monster 42oz container, which sits on my desk awaiting that precious moment at the end of the day when I snatch one from the can, unwrap the foil and experience toffee-induced nirvana.It's hard to find toffee in America. You won't find it in every candy section, and if you do, it's likely to be junk. I'm grateful to find this online and I think that any toffee lover is going to be quite pleased.
Well I have always been on a quest for that loaf of bread that matches what my grandmother used to make. Reading about how this might move me one step closer I purchased it with some hope it would help but not really confident it would make that much of a difference.Well I made my first batch and I am not sure how or why but everything came out incredibly well.  I made some loafs of bread and some bagels.  Both tasted great and certainly a step above my average results.  I am sure that this amount will last for a good while so the cost is not all that great and I think the result is certainly worth the expense.
After reading some positive reviews and recommendations from places like King Arthur Flour, I decided to give this bread add-in a try. I was skeptical a tablespoon or too would make a difference in my bread but it does seem to increase shelf life and slightly soften texture of all the loaves and rolls I've tried it with so far (sourdough, sweet rolls, dinner rolls). There is no distinct taste difference but the dough gets (much) easier to work with after the addition and it even seems to boost the rise a bit.Not an essential bread-making tool, but if you make from-scratch loaves a few times a week, like I do, a tiny, yet worthwhile investment and great addition to your pantry. A pretty good, overall "secret" ingredient.
I got this to use in a bread recipe that calls for powdered milk. I've tried the recipe with and without powdered milk and the recipe is serious: powdered milk really helps the rise. This product works as well as the popular (and way more expensive) brand of non-instant I'd been using, and I will definitely be purchasing this brand again when I run out. It tastes good as well in uses such as milk gravy and from-scratch macaroni & cheese, though it is, again, not instant--so it doesn't dissolve the same way. Lumps must be carefully attended.
ohhhh... this stuff is WONDEFUL!!!  Nothing else is quite like it.  The exquisite flavor not only adds to any mouthful of food but also wakes up the flavors of everything else you're eating.  Best mustard to go with prime beef.  Best mustard for sandwiches with lean meats, lettuce and fresh sprouts.  Best mustard with crackers and gourmet cheese (or, hey, just with crackers!).  A little goes a long way, and you feel coddled whenever you have some.We used to live near a gourmet food store where we could buy this whenever we ran out.  We got spoiled, and now it's VERY hard to find.  So great to see it on Amazon -- wow!!!!
I didn't know what to expect when I ordered this jar of pommery Mustard and was surprised when I tried it to see the consistency of the spread.  It looks like a mustard that hasn't been ground up[ completely.  Okay, if I had read up about it I probably would have known that the name tells it all.  There are always consequences for your actions, sometime good and sometimes bad.  This time I was lucky, this mustard is great on a sandwich.  I love the stone jar.'
In my opinion this is the best and only seasoning to buy for jerking your meats, it is spicy, easy to use and the absolute authentic jerk seasoning I will swear by. I have used this on all types of chicken and some other meats, I would not reccomend this for fish,unless you are going to pan sear the fish, fish is too delicate for this, try their marinade instead. This seasonig is not for the faint of heart, it is very hot and spicy just the way i like it. Try this only if you like your food hot and spicy, the seasoning works very well on the grill.
Bust out the napkins, grab yourself a beer, and buckle your seat belts cause this stuff is a properauthentic flamefest of Jamaican jerk heat. You can put it on straight, or cut it with a little oliveoil, but I've found it best to marinate chicken or pork tenderloins for at least 24 hours before cooking for optimum results.Its a little messy cause you really have to rub this stuff in and make sure you turn/shake your marinade bag every few hour to ensure an even distribution of this wondermous stuff. If you're not using rubber gloves, make sure you wash your hands and I wouldn't plan on rubbing your eyes or doing anything else to sensitive body parts for a while. haw hawThis stuff is the best, followed closely by Grace Jerk Seasoning but Walkerswood doesn't turn your chicken green like the Grace rub does. 5 Pods
I have never been to Jaimaica so am not trying to compare what the locals make.  Mainly comparing to Bush Brown's as that is my go to up to now.  Thought I would try this for a change of pace.  I find the heat to be similar.  This had a slightly different smell that was not as pleasant for some reason.  Maybe it was the allspice.  I will update my review as I use up the jar.It is thick and looks to be of good quality ingredients.  Came with a best by of Feb 2017 so definitely fresh.  So far used it on a pork roast grilled on the bbq marinated overnight.  Only needed about two tablespoons for the 4 lb roast so the jar will last quite a while.  Looking forward to BBQ chicken next.I May have to get a jar of Busha's to do a side by side and to compare ingredients.I would not deter anyone from using this over Busha's.
Really, I was expecting a matte slap in the face, so I was pleasantly surprised.  While mate still isn't my top flavor pick, it melded nicely in this blend. I took a sip straight to get a baseline flavor and was greeted with a mild sweetness, a relatively mellow tea, and the faintest hint of cocoa and spices.Following the instructions, I added a bit of almond milk (which I discovered can curdle a bit), but opted to skip the extra sweetener.  While still good, I actually liked it better without milk added.  Though I am not a latte drinker, and have had some less than stellar experiences with mate, this tea gets the thumbs up.I marked just one star down, as the price is quite exorbant for a relatively inexpensive tea.
I really love this tea. I should start out and say that I, like most, kind of secretly expected this tea to taste like maybe hot chocolate or to have a real chocolate taste. It does not. It tastes like tea with some spices is all. It has maybe a hint of cocoa, but it's not the full on chocolate taste people are going to expect. So keep this in mind before sipping, or you'll get a little disappointed. It's a really mild tea, no bitterness at all, and it has a great scent and flavor. It even wakes me up and gives me a bit of energy in the morning. I took off one star because of the price, I wish it were a little cheaper. Overall I recommend anyone try this.
If you like chai, than you'll probably like this... I don't. I do however like unsweetened Yerba Mate, and wouldn't mind if it came with a more complex flavors. In the past I've mixed it with herbal mint or berry teas with good results and I was hoping this would be one bag solution to a chocolaty version. I knew it had other ingredients other than Mate and Cocoa, but were hoping they were milder background notes than they turned out to be. After I bought this I found (The Republic of Tea, Double Dark Chocolate Mate, 36-Count) and it's exactly what I was looking for, earthy and aromatic but not sweet cocoa flavors. It's a little pricey, but I feel it's worth it. I'm still happy with Guayaki's plain mate, but I'm going to have to pass on this one.PROS:+ Nice quality Chai style MateCONS:- Tastes like Chai and Stevia (neither of which I particularly care for)
I am already a fan of Organic Yerba Mate Tea 25 Bags and a fan of chocolate.  This mix is the best of yerba mate with just a hint of chocolate.  If you are looking for a more milk-chocolate flavor, try it with a little sweetener and milk.  The hint of chocolate gives this yerba mate a more bitter flavor closer to coffee than the plain yerba matte but without the coffee acid and reduced caffeine.  Yerba mate is a good flavor in itself and not just as a coffee substitute.  The chocolate gives us yerba mate fans some variety in flavors.
A delicious and effective mild brain stimulant, Yerba Mate is a South American tradition spreading through the US market as an alternative to the caffeine bomb drinks that flood the market under the "energy drink" category.  what I affectionally call the "twitchy seizure" category - Red Bull, Monster, etc.)Note: there is a substantial amount of information on the internet (take that for what it's worth) that suggests that prolonged excessive use of Yerba Mate can lead to some significant health risks.  Not sure if there's any truth to that or not...probably best to enjoy in moderation anyway...which is what I would recommend for coffee and all the caffeine bomb drinks too.  Let your daily morning pickup be a nice hot cup of camellia sinensis - plain black tea, enjoyed around the world by people that live healthier longer lives than us Yanks.
I use carob powder in every recipe that calls for cocoa.  I especially love it in my morning protein shake that I make with hempseeds, hemp protein, chia seeds and almond milk.I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 because it doesn't taste any different to me than carob that is dark roasted.  I thought it would have a less &#34;carob&#34; flavor, but that's not the case.  But it is good tasting.  I do prefer raw carob, although it is too expensive, so I will continue to buy the light roast.
I make all of my own bread, so I go through a lot of yeast! I just laugh at the tiny packets and jars supermarkets tend to stock. This one-pound bag lasts a good long while. I keep some in a jar in the fridge, and the rest sealed in a bag in the freezer to replenish the jar as needed. It seems like really good yeast--it doesn't have to be proofed but can go straight into baked goods' dry ingredients. And the results with SAF are consistent, unlike with other yeasts. I used to have trouble with bread not rising sometimes when it seemed like I'd done everything right. With SAF, if you follow the same steps, you will get the same results. And that matters a lot to me.
why buy packets?? when you can save a truckload of money buying bulk!when i found this, saf instant yeast, i was amazed.  baking has become much cheaper for me.i actually got a pound from a friend who ordered from another spot.brick comes sealed, when cracked you hear the release of air.i put a nice portion in an airtight container, and slapped it in my fridge.  that's the one i'll mainly use.the rest i have in an airtight container which resides in my freezer for when the main stash in the fridge runs out.one pound of this saf yeast, is almost equal in price of 3 packets of another brand yeast in my local supermarket.WHAT A GREAT DEAL!if you bake and buy packet yeast, you need to get yourself one of these, saf yeast pounder =)great quality, great price!  happy baking =)!
I discovered this brand of yeast a few years back when troubleshooting issues with my first bread machine; I found that not only did it solve the problems of less than perfect results from the machine but it improved the results with my hand kneaded loaves as well. I bake in smaller quantities for a single person and only a few times a week so this size was more than I could use but still more economical than the smaller packages. I store it in the coldest part of my refrigerator in an airtight container. At the two year mark it was still "active" and producing good loaves, but I'd rather not discover the hard way when it is truly past its peak so I've purchased it again. Excellent results every time!
This is just to let you know there is another listing on Amazon for a 4 pack of these 1-pounders for only a few bucks more!  Much better value if you can put it to good use!Update: Just received my 4-pack, and baked some bread.  I am very happy with the results.  Good yeast!  I put it in a ziplock bag, and am refrigerating it so I can get more use out of it.  The bags are vacuum-packed, so they should stay fresh until they are opened (though the package has a "best if used by" for 2 years after the manufacture date).  I ordered this in March, and it was manufactured/produced in November, so it is pretty fresh.
I have always used Saf so this is a prejudiced review. I keep it in an airtight, moisture proof container in the refrigerator. It has been in my fridge for over a year at times and less than 6 months for most of the time. There are currently only 2 people in this household, unlike the 8 before, when I'd use it up much faster.I love baking all kinds of breads with this. Challah once a week, sandwich bread, rolls, french bread, etc... I should say that I grind my own wheat and it is a great yeast for that heavier flour.
You can keep this in the freezer, so it stays fresh a long time, and is much cheaper than the little packets from the grocery.I use it without thawing.  I don't know if that would work with traditional bread recipes, might need a slightly longer first rise.But I use a recipe for "no knead" bread that requires a 20-24 hour rise after the initial mixing of dough and before baking.  I mix my dough after dinner one night and cook it for dinner the second night.  With that long a rise, I can't tell the difference between starting with frozen yeast versus fresh yeast.So this is very handy for me since I just measure out the frozen yeast and at a significant savings over individual packets from the grocery.
I use instant yeast to make home made DIY CO2 for several of my planted aquariums.  In the past the mixture I made usually lasted about a week.It is now 19 days into the first batch of DIY CO2 that I  made with SAF instant yeast, and  the CO2 bubbles are still going strong.If the CO2 bubbles last another two days at this rate the CO2 production using SAF will have lasted three times longer than the last instant yeast that I used.This yeast is amazing.  If it's nearly as good at making bread as it is for making DIY CO2 I will be even more pleased.Highly recommended!
Have you ever wanted to know how professional bakers could afford to bake bread and rolls  and give them away with the price of yeast as high as it is?Here's the secret:  SAF-Instant Yeast!  A 16-ounce will last for all the home baking most people will do for months, or perhaps years.  It is supposed to last one year, but it can  easily last 5-10 years, according to a number of sources.  It is to be stored in a cool dry place.SAF Instant Yeast is a powerful and fast-acting yeast.  It can be added to dry ingredients directly.  It is  twice  as active as regular compressed yeast.
I realize I could have purchased it elsewhere for less price, but since it isn't available locally, and the shipping was free here as an &#34;add-on&#34;  I went with Amazon. I can tell the difference in my breads using this brand over the Fleishmans. It gives a constant even rise.  the best thing I like about this yeast is that I can use it straight from the freezer with same great results, which eliminates the waiting for &#34;room temperature&#34; state required by other yeasts I've used.
You can't beat the price. Even if you're used to buying the small 4 oz. jars of Fleischmann's for less than $5, this is a whole Lb. for just $7.25! It does require proofing, so it's not a substitute for recipes that require &#34;Rapid Rise&#34; yeast, but it's fresh (I got a batch produced in 04/13 in 08/13) and it's got a two year shelf-life. I've used quite a bit of it so far and I haven't noticed any delay in rising time, or any difference in flavor from what I was using before. It's worth trying for sure.
I have usedRed StarandFleischmann's Yeastand both good, but I've come to really prefer the LeSaffre yeast.I 'discovered' LeSaffre yeast while reading through bread recipes at the King Arthur website and the positive reviews there motivated me to get out of my rut and try something new.Since I had begun to bake all of my family's bread, I was okay with ordering a pound of yeast.  Given the price of the little packets, and even the little jars, it made sense to make the purchase because even if I ended up throwing some away, it would still be much cheaper to buy the yeast this way.The reason I like the LeSaffre yeast is that it gives me a better and more consistent rise-- and I use whole wheat flour.Definitely recommend.
I did research and read that SAF is about the best yeast in the world.  Well... I have found it works better with some recipes and not as well with others.  (Whole Wheat vs White, Home Milled Flour vs Store Bought).  This is also a large amount of yeast.  I am not sure if it is to be refrigerated or not... but I have chosen to vacuum seal it in a Mason Jar and store in fridge to try and keep it fresh for as long as possible.  In the future, I will stick with the other smaller jars I can get at the grocery store.
As someone that bakes a LOT, for my own family and others, Saf has been a dependable yeast.If you use yeast, it is absolutely throwing money out of the window to buy the small packets.I've used yeast that has been frozen for over 3 years, and it is still active.I portion it into glass jars and always have a few in the freezer and one in the fridge.It lasts far beyond the expiration date  when frozen.For each packet of yeast called for in a recipe, use  2 1/4  teaspoons.
We are very satisfied with this product. It just has psyllium husks - no additives, no sugar, no sugar substitutes, like all store and drugstore brands. It works great, it cleanses your intestines, gives you more energy. I know it also controls cholesterol, treats constipation and diarrhea and can lower your weight. However, my reason for taking it while being on anti-candida diet together with Candida clear, garlic, pau d'arco tea and grapefruit seed extract.Thank you for making this product with no additives (can't take any added sugar)
This is an updated review for the third shipment as I purchase more than 10boxes for each order. I enjoy Stevita Supreme very much but there seems to be some inconsistency in the sweetness. The first box which I've opened aren't sweetness (and I'm already using the 12th sachet in this particular box) while the previous 2 shipments were all right. Can Stevita Stevia please explain on the inconsistency of sweetness and currently, I've to use 1.5 sachet to get the sweetness while I use only one sachet for the 1st 2 shipments? I still have 12 more boxes and I'm wonderfing if I should continue using Stevia.
Update 8//10/13 - just happen to mention this (noxious cloud from emptying the packets) to the doctor when we were in for a checkup this spring.  She suggested Trader Joe's Organic Stevia Extract (powder, granules?).  Sure enough, no cloud.  Super small measuring device included; some people might not like dealing with it.  We like it.We make ice tea in the Mr. Coffee ice tea maker (old style) four or five times a week and it only takes four packets to suite my wife's taste for 64 ounces.  I was thrown off by the 1.8 ounce packet, but apparently they have added a heavy carrying agent that doesn't make the stuff so noxious when you empty it into the pitcher.  Good deal!
I have been eating Atkins life style for a yr now and was using splenda and pink packet sweetners until I realized I was forgetting almost everything of normal routine stuff, and having extreme headaches daily, I thought I was going insane.  I decided to try stevita after reading some reveiws about stevia, I gradually started putting in half stevita and half pink packet, I don't ever recommend doing that, I ended up with a horrible reaction, the headaches went from pain to a numb tingly feeling to flu like symtoms then my urine became a floresent yellow that smelled 10ft away like a chemical, never try that again.  I have been using stevita now for 7mnths and love it, I put a packet in a cup of warm coconut milk with malt, thats my cheat treat from eating Atkins once a wk, lovely stuff and low carb.
Ive tried them allllllllll and the verdict is still out but so far I would rate this the  best.  What I mean by best is that its not sugar but its as close as Ive managed to get in coffee.  I dont have a problem using anything while baking but in my coffee....urgh.  Nothing beats the taste of sugar.  This comes close and Ive bought the Stevia drops in chocolate, toffee and vanilla.  I guess Toffee was the best of the worst but my kids love it in Milk so its a treat for them! As I run around the house chasing 3 kids, my coffee gets cold and that is the ultimate test, is it drinkable after its cold.  Im drinking it now and I can do this!  Weight loss here I come!I can honestly say, I will order this again and I can drink it and almost really enjoy it.
I tried the Sweet Leaf stevia a few years ago and found it had an aftertaste that turned me off to stevia as a regular sugar substitute in my diet.I am GLAD I paid attention to the other folks who bought this brand of Stevia!!  It's wonderful!  Has absolutely NO aftertaste even straight out of the packet on your finger!Now I will use stevia since I can handle a good tasting stevia any day!!  Highly recommend this product if you don't like an aftertaste in your stevia.
I just received my package of Stevita Supreme stevia "sweetener". It is the most repulsive tasting sweetener I have ever used. I'm sure saccharine is better tasting than this stuff! I did a side my side comparison of Stevita, aspartame and Splenda. The aspartame and Splenda are both decent tasting, and the Stevita is HORRIBLE! Bitter, and tasting of some sort of chemical.Thank-god it was only [...] bucks with free delivery because it's probably going in the trash or to a soup kitchen - though the homeless certainly deserve better than this stuff.
After trying NuNaturals NuStevia, this one tastes almost like real sugar! It is actually the closest to the real thing among the ones I've tried. I will buy this brand again but of course will try other brands to see if I like it better than this. If I have to rate the sugar taste similarity (10 being exactly the same as sugar), I would say:NuNaturals - 5Stevita Supreme - 7.5Also, the other thing I like about this brand, it is not like powder powder. It is kinda crystallized like sugar.
This is a mix of Stevia, Xylitol, and something called Rebaudiana extract.  I haven't tried other Stevia products but this does have a slightly bitter aftertaste when taken straight.  Also, it does clump in the packet.  On the plus side I haven't had the, er, alimentary issues I've had with straight Xylitol.I'm glad I tried this, but I'm not planning to keep using it.  I don't think it's significantly different from using honey as a sweetener - but that's not what I want for coffee!
I'm trying a few other brands of Stevia, but I will stick with these when I reorder. I like my stuff sweet and this is the stuff !!! I used to drink coffee/tea with a lot of sugar in it, but I wanted to get away from that. I don't like those yellow, blue & pink packs of sweetner, but I was using them anyway until I couldn't stand it any longer. Real sugar would try and sneak it's way back in. I think I was hooked on sugar ??!! I was glad to find this product. It's great and sugar doesn't call my name anymore. Try it, you'll like it !!!! Stop eating all that sugar !!!!!!
I bought this for around 2.50 shipped with amazon prime. This was a great price to buy 50 packets of stevita supreme. I use one packet in my tea and 2 in my coffee. it's perfect for use in sweetening iced tea or coffee, hot or cold i've not noticed any fake aftertaste. Doesn't give me a headache like sweet and low or equal will. Stevia has 0 calories and comes from a natural plant. stevita is the best brand I've tried. I will order this again.
This is the stuff that makes your chop suey taste like chinese take out. It was missing in my order I think it may have been broken during shipping. It is good enough to steal though lol. I've sent a note to company through Amazon and I am sure they will solve the problem. If you can get it locally it is much less expensive. There are lots of great cooks here and I've tried lots of stuff I've never had before. Sometimes you just get a taste for &#34;northern chinese&#34; lol. I've used this brand for many years with complete satisfaction. Use very very sparingly. I usually start out with about 1/2 -3/4 teaspoon. Stir well add more if needed. A little goes a long way.
One of the best I've found around. Refrigerate after opening, even though it's not printed on the label as I've had a few bottles go bad by not doing so. Adds a great teats to many dishes & soups It does not have to be Oriental to use it in. Be creative with this sauce. Beware it does have MSG in it. One bad thing about it. However after checking out all Real Oyster Sauces they all contain MSG in them. Other wise I can recommend this product and use it for your use. Enjoy But BEWARE of the MSG! That is why the 3 stars
I usually buy tons of stuff here on Amazon, but when I started looking for Hoisin I just trodded through the grocery stores. All they had was some no name brand in a jar. I dont know about you but when I am eating chinese or vietnamese food I am for the most part using chop sticks and just want to hose something on it and pop it in my mouth. The only kind I ever saw in restaurants was this kind with the squirty bottle and got used to it. The jar just looked stupid, then you would need a spoon, then a bowl, then cleanup ahhhh.Had a brain flash and said &#34;look on Amazon and there it was. Same brand as the good food places I frequent.Life is now complete.
I use this stuff like it was ketchup, honestly. It goes with everything. Hoisin is awesome on chinese food, thai food, vietnamese food, its good with hamburgers, fries, and even with steak instead of steak sauce. Hoisin is sweet, and salty and has this certain kick to it that makes it unique amoung condiments. The first time i ever saw it used was when i was watching PBS Yan Can Cook, and he busted out the Lee Kum Kee bottle and i was mesmerized with its rich brown color, and Yan Can do no wrong with me!!!!
I'm fortunate to have a local store that sells great pickled ginger made fresh, but getting minced ginger is a chore. I went through several different brands and types before I found this one. A bit sweet, a bit spicy and easy to mix into most anything, I like this ginger because it's a simple addition to Asian dishes. No mincing to do on your own, the ginger itself is moist with a nice consistency and everything about it seemed fresh. I'm about to buy another jar of it.
I am picky about my spices, and I know when they are good. This product is not good. And it is NOT a substitute for fresh ginger. It has a weird, offputting chemical aroma and flavor, and packs none of the ginger punch it should. I used it once, then dumped the remainder down the drain in distaste. You're much better off with the Ginger People brand. (See this product:Ginger People Organic Minced Ginger -- 6.7 oz) That one is so good, it can actually substitute for fresh ginger. It can even be used in chai! Amazon used to sell it by the case; hopefully they will get their act back together soon. In the meantime, I am buying it from Abe's.
Peeling and grating ginger is a labor intensive and time consuming process. This product eliminates all that extra time and work. I use it to put in the basket with my loose leaf teas to get a nice ginger tang to my tea and for any other recipe or sauce or salsa or anything else I make that needs a ginger tang. Even great for quick breads and cookies and doesn't have the sugar of candied ginger which many recipes call for. You can replace the sugar with artificial sweeteners if you need the sweetness.
Even though I live in Montana and never want to leave, I do miss the ubiquity of good Chinese food restaurants in San Francisco. Because I pride myself on being able to cook my own versions of various foods I like, I knew I needed minced ginger for the sheer amount of Asian dishes that require it.I've already used it in several recipes and the flavor is nice and strong. Just like when I buy containers of minced garlic (something that is FAR easier to find in your average Montana grocery store), I tend to buy enough to last me for a decent amount of time. This 7.5oz jar will likely last me until sometime in the new year. By then I'll have $25 in my cart so that this will ship with it (The add-on program is perfect for stuff like this).
I feel I paid to much for this at Amazon but not always having somebody around to run the store to get fresh ginger for me or not wanting to inconvient somebody  makes having this around a big help when I want good ginger flavor in my recipe,no this is not a perfect replacement for the real thing but works real well with great ginger flavor.Just make sure you look around before buying like I did since there is better prices out there but to be fair Amazon provides great service and two day delivery which most do not and if they do provide two day service it costs a small fortune.
This is very very good Missy. First of all, you should not be using that Kikkomann crap youbought at the grocery. This is a professional grade soy sauce, naturally brewed with a verysmooth and savory texture that is flavorful and easy on the palate. A must for any Chinesetakeout, and particularly for homemade marinades. Dont even attempt to make Teriyaki marinadewithout a good quality dark soy sauce like this.Lee Kum Kee is a major producer of a variety of Chinese food products for the consumer and therestaurant trade. They have a fantastic website with recipes and instructional cooking videoscovering a range of well known dishes. 5 Stars! (link to website posted in Comments section)
This is the perfect soy for making stir fry; pepper steak and for marinades.  Dark soy is heavier than the stuff you get at the grocery store.  If you have never used dark soy to cook, I would highly recommend it - has a fuller bodied flavor and makes a huge difference when making the brown sauce (like in pepper steak or beef with asparagus, etc.)  If you are like me, once you have used dark soy for cooking, you will never again use the thin watery soy sauce.
I recently sent for a Senseo Coffee Pod maker on a very good deal, & was looking here to get the pods. I read a lot of the reviews, & was looking foward to getting them here, plus this brand sounds like it would be to my taste. However, they apparently don't ship to Alaska! At least it said they don't ship to my location, & since I have gotten other items from Amazon, I assume it's the Alaska location. How disappointing, after reading so many great reviews. Just had to vent a bit. I enjoyed the reviews, though, they really are a help, good & not-so-good.
All right, we today became beneficiaries of a free coffee maker from Senseo, thanks to a generous tip from a favorite of my Amazon friends.But this brand of coffee packets that came with the machine is nothing to write home about. At retail, the packs cost about 23 cents, if we order enough to avoid shipping charges.The smell of this fresh-brewed coffee is fantastic. The taste is less than I had hoped for. I think I'll try Target's Archer Farms, as suggested by another reviewer.
My wife and I have been drinking Senseo pods for years.  We have always used the medium roast.  On our last shipment we noticed the coffee tastes stale and old.  Very nasty.  The old pods have the sense logo on the pods themselves and these new pods do not so I don't know what that means but that seems to be the way to identify the bad tasting pods.  These are so bad we can't even drink them.  I'm going to try one more order and if that tastes the same we may actually quit sense and move to Keurig.  VERY disappointed in the new medium roast and I would not recommend as it tastes like coffee that is a week old.
I use this in a Keurig coffee maker, using the adaptor cup.  It works fine, and the coffee is good.  Although the Keurig is nice and convenient, it is not the cheapest way to get a cup of coffee.  Using these pods cuts the cost about in half.I like this dark roast and will continue to buy it.  The taste of coffee, like the taste of anything else, is a personal preference.  I like it, but you might hate it.  The pods, though, are reasonably-priced and work well with my Keurig.
We drink Senseo Douwe Egberts coffee in my house every day. I usually use one pod for my morning coffee, and a "double" on the weekend. While I like all the varieties, medium roast is my favorite. We buy it by the 4-pack case in my house.The coffee has good body and is not bitter. I take mine with cream and sugar, but it is so easy to drink I could even go without and it still tastes great to me. The pod system is so clean and easy too. I love the fact that there is no cleanup. I think it would work especially well for someone who doesnt normally drink coffee but would like to have something nice when guests come over. Because the pods come in small lined bags, it stays fresh longer.
Excellent decaf that can go toe-to-toe with some caffeinated coffees. Rich tasting with no bitterness. A must purchase if you have a Senseo and want to go decaf.I just wish they would offer more options for decaf, such as some different flavored coffees (hazelnut in particular). As it stands, this is the one and only decaf offering from Senseo. I have to make my own pods if I want something different (not hard to do, and cheaper, but I do like the convenience of the pre-made pods).
One downside of a Senseo machine, is that unless you want an espresso size cup of coffee, you need to make 2 cups, which means you need two pods, at around 5.69 and bag for 18 pods, it can get pricey. The dark roast solves the problem. You put one in, and you make two cups! Before I found the Senseo, I was an average folgers, yuban mild coffee drinking type. I have the value pack on amazon grocery as a subscription...works out great!!
Okay... so I am new to Senseo and ALL of its varieties of coffees. The machine came with a sample of Dark Roast. It's not that the roast itself was bad, it just tasted "flat" - none of the overtones of the nectar of the gods - and I was sorely disappointed. However, I was on a mission to make 1 cup at a time, having reviewed all the other 1 cup machines out there I was sure that Senseo was not just the best deal, but the best machine - and then... when all hope seemed lost... a light at the end of the tunnel was seen and at its core was Medium Roast. This stuff is good coffee people! You can taste the nuances and hints of floral, chocolately, nutty, and all those other words that go with describing good coffee... so I highly recommend these pods. They taste wonderful and will have you returning to the Senseo for another cup before work begins... FIVE STARS!!!
Went for economy in latest order and got the 6 pack as I could not recall what Dark Roast tasted like. Counted on all the positive reviews, but we all have different palates, don't we? I prefer Senseo's Kenya or Sumatra as a more reliably flavorful brew with Sumatra probably my favorite. Just opened my first of six bags, so I have a ways to go before I get to the end of my "bargain" purchase of a brew that is weak and one-dimensional. I guess I will have to play with the amount of water and pods as other reviewers suggest to try to get something strong enough to satisfy. Just can't throw it all out!
The dark roast is good coffee.  Never liked the other flavors.  Well, the decaf is OK.  Super Saver Subscription brings price down to about $0.22 per cup of coffee.  And Senseo means it's always fresh.  Occasionally one pod in a pack will have ripped open (in transit, or from manufacturer).  This makes a mess of the other pods and will result in the occasional extra gritty bits in your coffee.  Call Senseo if this happens, and they'll send you a coupon for another bag.
I have a Hamilton Beach On the Go one cup brewer.  These pods are perfect for it.  I like the coffee.  It is not as bold as I had expected, but I do like it.  I went from needing cream and sugar in coffee (because I never measured properly and ended up with either too strong or weak coffee) to being able to drink these black.  Wish there was more consistency in the price.  I have to watch it all the time to see whether or not it will be going back to a reasonable price (~$25).
Here's the thing: the one-cup Senseo coffeemakers for which this pod is designed have proved unreliable. I wouldn't buy any more of them. But these pods are fabulous.I got these nearly two years ago for my Senseo pod coffeemaker that lasted for all of 30 uses. Junk, crap. But these pods have proved the opposite. They have outstanding flavor, even when they ought to be stale. Usually I have brewed coffee but when I run out and it doesn't make sense to make another pot, I put fresh water in a cup, add one of these and heat it in the microwave. Presto! A cup of java to which I add my 1% milk and enjoy. I am simply amazed that I can get such a good cuppa from a non-refrigerated, long-opened package, coffee pod!
"Someone gave me a Senseo machine, so I bought this coffee.  I'm very disappointed with the taste!  It's bland and dull tasting.  Too bad, as I have 4 bags now!"This was my previous review.  Since then, I gave away the Senseo machine, but I kept the coffee and use it in a cup of hot water I do in the microwave.  The coffee is actually good.  I guess somehow the machine flavored it.  Maybe it's because the water doesn't sit in the coffee for long enough.  Using my microwave method, I let the coffee bag brew awhile before pressing it and removing it -- very good taste.  Go figure!  Anyway, I'd recommend this coffee as microwavable bags.
I find I need to add two pods to my single cup coffee maker to get a good tasting coffee. One pod is a little weak.The taste is pleasant, and well rounded. I just wish they made them a little stronger.My de facto coffee comes from a 12 cup coffee maker, I fall back on using these pods if I only have time for a single cup, or need to make a quick brew for a visitor. For everyday use, using 2 pods per cups, would be expensive. These pods are very convenient, but not cost effective is you like your coffee strong.
If you can't have candy with real sugar then these are passable, but not much better, if at all, than say a Hershey sugar-free dark chocolate. Dark chocolate  is usually more dense (so not soft, right?) and not as sweet as milk chocolate. These need a firm bite and the overall taste is just ok (but at least there is no chemical after taste as with some sugar free stuff), but they served the purpose. Main gripe is, at least with this seller, you have to order enough candy bars to supply a neighborhood of diabetes patients (like me). So, still searching, but in the meantime munching away at second of 24 bars!
A friend bought us some Amber Lyn chocolate since she knew my hubby loves chocolate yet is a diabetic -- WOW were we impressed with the taste! I also love chocolate but HATE the normal sugar free variety as the synthetic sweetener always upsets my digestion, plus they have a non-smooth consistancy -- this chocolate does NOT upset my delicate system, and is very good and GUILT FREE!Update: I have removed 1 star from my rating -- The variety pack includes a bar with "chocolate bits" - this one crumbles like other sugar free chocolates and is not pleasant to eat - reminds me of Monica on Friends trying to make "mokolate" taste good in recipes....
I saw the reviews for it while I was looking for some international snacks on Amazon and everyone really liked it so I ordered it and it was well worth the wait.  They're elegantly made, being flattened but slightly curvy, light in weight and texture but definitely crispy when you bite into them. They're like thin biscotti in that they're crispy and light and they're better to eat when you dunk them in your coffee or tea and they're not too sweet and they have slightly  gingery/cinnamon (but not overpowering) taste.  They're like elegant gourmet lightly made ginger cookies - I can see why everyone loves them!  I buy them regularly for my mom.  Fortunately, I've found that our local Walgreen's has them all the time - they're that popular!!  Giving them to a friend would be like giving your friend a very special treat.  I would definitely buy them again!!
This pecorino romano was a little younger than I expected. Not a truly hard cheese that crumbles, but sufficiently aged so that it grates well. It also shaves nicely.Because it was a little younger than pecorino romano I've had before, it didn't have such a sharp salty taste. But it had a taste that I didn't expect -- something like a strong cheddar with a nutty quality. The first thing I did with it was grate some over pasta with a little olive oil and parsley. The result was ... well, swoon material. Mac and cheese for grown ups. And yes it's great on pasta with sauce, as well as egg tacos, been soup, hamburgers and just melted on morning toast.I think the price is good, and I'm definitely going to get more.If you're a cheese lover, particularly if you're f0nd of Asiago, I suggest you give this a try. It's a great alternative.
I've loved these flavorful almond flavored (apricot seed) aromatic cookies for decades. These inimitable Lazzaroni treats are delicious with tea, coffee, or alone, in cold weather or hot. They imbue an extra bit of pleasure to viewing the abundant delights ofTwo Fat Ladiesenjoying life and food with humor and gusto. The attractive Italian tin happens to be a very useful decorative object for goody-storage. We appreciate that these cookies ship well even in hot weather, and they arrive unbroken, protected by the tin. When you open the lid, a scent like amaretto liqueur wafts up. Enjoy!
Many people consider these a staple to be kept in the pantry.  Not only do they make a great cookie, but you can bake with them, using the crumbled cookies for toppings, pie crusts, crumbs etc.I figure everyone has probably already tried these but, if you haven't, they are a classic Italian type meringue like almond cookie puff.  They are sweet but still retain a lot of the real, nutty, very slightly bitter almond qualities of real almonds.  The come wrapped in pretty little twisted paper wrappers, making it easy to throw one or two packets into your lunch bag.  They are super-light but still satisfying.  I've never met anyone of any age who disliked them, either, which is another reason they are good to keep on hand, because your guests will be happy even if these are the only cookies you have.
Confession: I have been a true fan of Starbucks. I used to think Starbucks was the best coffee ever and the many bags of Starbucks in my pantry will prove that! However, I recently received a gift of a half pound ofilly Caffe Normale Drip/Medium Grind (Blue Band) Coffee, 8.8 Ounce Tins (Pack of 2)and I was for once in my life, truly impressed with the quality, flavor, and aroma of this coffee. I also find this to be heartbreaking as I do not know what to do with all my Starbucks that I have on hand. I just gave 3 pounds of my Starbucks to my mother-in-law since I will not be drinking it anymore. If you are a true coffee conesseiur then you will love Illy coffee. If I ever open a coffee shop, I would be more than happy to invest in this company.
This is an excellent product, easy to make and true to the shop's most popular item.  I find it very difficult to get true chocolate flavor from almost any manufactured item, it always seems to be missing that deep flavor. I was pleasantly surprised with Serendipity, they nailed it.  The cost is a little high but I don't think you could do any better price-wise at home buying all the different kinds of chocolates used.  The best way to describe the flavor is  deep cocoa .  It's rich and dark, like hot chocolate.  It tastes nothing at all like a milkshake although it's is cold.  The canister is a nice improvement over the pouches, you get to customize the flavor a little easier.  Because of the cost, it's a once in a while treat for us and it is a favorite.  Buy with confidence, it's a delicious product.
I wanted to try this because the closest place to buy kimchee is 2 cities away...and way too much trouble; especially when I can make great kimchee at home. I followed the packet instructions ( using kosher salt for the initial soak). Then, after it was rinsed ( 12 hours later) I drained it very well and layered it ( cabbage, spice mix, cabbage, spice mix) into a 1 gallon plastic bucket ( available on Amazon.....cheap). Put the top on and left it on the counter for 24 hours, then in the fridge for 2 days. I DID think it was not quite spicy enough, and needed a little complexity, so I added 2 tsps. of Sambal Terasi ( also on Amazon) for the depth of the garlic and the shrimp.............SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good! Crunchy and garlicky and just hot enough. Addictive!
Based on the other reviews, I hoped for great flavor.  This did not deliver.  I had not made char siu for many years, but I was hoping for the char siu I had made of old.  This was a pale, pale imitation.  Next time, I'm going to use two or three envelopes and marinate for several days.  Maybe that will do the trick.  But I'm afraid I'm going to have to forget about the lazy man's solution and find my old recipe and do it from scratch.
I have tried many brands of Chinese style BBQ seasoning...from dry packets to bottle sauces...and this one is THE BEST! It looks, smells and tastes like the kind of red and sweet BBQ pork you get in most Chinese restaurants. I have bought and re-ordered these packets from Amazon when my grocery stores quit carrying this brand. They are not as sweet as what you get in a restaurant...so I add a tiny bit of brown sugar to mine when I marinate...also works well with chicken. YUMMY =)
This is hulled barley; the hull is left on and must cook longer than pearl barley, but the end result is better nutrition.  There are cooking directions on the package.However, for ten bucks... way too expensive.  The volume of 1 lb of hulled barley can fit into about one sandwich baggie.Though I have no complaints with the product, and a little bit of barley goes a long way.... at this price point, it is too expensive for me to order again.  There is better value elsewhere on amazon.com
I just purchased this tea because I was looking for a simple, inexpensive, and great tasting black tea.  I read the other reviews for PG tips (which were great) so I bought some.  So the outcome?It's excellent. It steeps very quickly and has a nice strong taste.  My mother (at first) noticed that the teabags didn't have strings and said something to the effect of "yeah usually if the tea is of cheaper quality it doesn't have strings..." or something weird like that.  Lets just say she quickly got over that and she now makes this tea constantly.  Highly recommended for an inexpensive black tea.  Lets just say the brits know their tea!
I actually bought a small box of this tea just to try it out. I used it for a few weeks and thought "That was good, but nothing special." But after 2 weeks of being back on my old tea, I miss it. So I'm buying some more. :) My normal US tea is Newmans Organic or Luzianne, so that's all I have to compare it to.Note: Each PG bag has about 2 times the weight of tea that 1 bag of a US tea bag has. Or put another way, 2 PG bags equal 1 "family" bag of US tea. So while it looks more expensive, in the long run it's not really. In fact, I can make a full gallon of ice tea with just 8 of these bags. So the price is about the same or better, and the tea tastes better in my opinion.
The product I purchased was excellent, and the service and delivery prompt. However, the item was advertised as "free shipping", yet when I was billed, I was charged what, in my opinion, was an excessive amount for the handling and mailing. The bill further stated that my order didn't qualify for free shipping (I can't remember the reason; either it was below their minimum or for some other reason).Would I purchase again from this vendor? Yes, but I would clarify the shipping issue before hand.
I am very impressed. I saw the reviews and just had to try some, the reviews for this tea are incredible. The teabags do not have tags or strings, which is a bummer, but the taste of the tea makes you forget about that little detail. It just has this strong, smooth flavor, yet not bitter... This is some of the best tea I've tried. I want to get it in decaf too so I can drink it in the evening without the caffeine keeping me awake. Highly recommend.
My friends at work tease me because I have an entire desk drawer dedicated to tea.  I love my tea.  I almost exclusively drink loose leaf tea.  I love the taste and the ritual.  But sometimes I don't feel like taking the time to prepare a pot of loose leaf tea, so I "settle" for a tea bag.PG Tips really isn't a compromise for me though.  I love PG Tips.  It's a great blend of black teas.  The taste is great and the bag is convenient.It's not completely accurate to call this a "bag" though, because it's a pyramid.  The water flows through the pyramid very nicely.  There's no string to take it out with though.  That's OK.  Use a spoon or let it continue to steep while you drink it.Excellent black tea blend!
I'm very particular about my tea and this is my favorite so I'm delighted to find it on Amazon.com.  Living in the back of beyond it is not available in local stores.  If you prefer tea bags with string tags hanging from them you probably won't like this.  Most Americans make tea with hot, not boiling water and then say they don't like tea.  Another reason, in my opinion, why Americans don't like tea is they were raised on Lipton tea.  If you are on the fence about tea try PG Tips with boiling water.
I have a British friend, and once she knew I liked to drink tea, she said I had to get the PG Tips!  Now, I couldn't find them at any local store when I went shopping.  So when I saw these as an add on item, I put in my shopping cart, and waited for my next amazon purchase (never more than a week goes by, sad to say).  I got them home, put them in a sealed container, to keep them fresh, and brewed up a cuppa!  Yum!
A native Brit - I am addicted to my PG tips. So, now that I am living in the US I am committed to buying it online. The tea is full-bodied and so flavorful. I brew it straight in my tea mug by pouring boiling water from my electric kettle straight onto the tea bag and let it steep for about a minute. It is strong enough for me by then and then I add my reduced-fat (2%) milk to reach a color akin to pale pine flooring. Drink it piping hot and its a fantastic morning pick-me-up. I prefer to buy it in packs of 40 to keep it fresh but the price on the 80s was hard to pass.
I and my wife love this tea. PG Tips is not easily obtained in many stores in USA, and I was happy to see on Amazon, and for correct price. This tea is really different. We put mint leaves and a tea bag for two small cups, and we also put honey. It smells great. On a evening, after a hard days work, to smell this hot tea, is relaxing. The taste is really great, we love this tea much better compared to other normal ones we see in stores. They claim that they make this tea from the tips of young leaves, and that really does make a difference. Highly recommended tea.
-1 star for containing sulphates; many members of my family are allergic to them.Yatzee always talked about Branston Pickle in his early Zero Punctuation videos. I read that the taste is a blend of Worcestershire sauce & sweet pickle relish; both things I like on hamburgers & plain burger patties.The description is accurate. I managed to find my first jar at Gourmet's Gallery in Friday Harbor when I was visiting San Juan Island. I couldn't find it at any of the specialty stores back home.I'll get more creative latter & try it on deviled egg sandwiches & grilled Tuna Melts with white jack/white cheddar/colby-swiss.
I've tried a number of liquid and powdered stevias, and this is by far my favorite.  My husband stole my bottle after he tried it, because he loves it in his iced tea, and he's never liked the stevias I've bought before.  The flavors are fun for coffee, but the plain is fantastic for iced tea.  It has no carbs, unlike powdered stevias, if you're a carb counter.  I emailed their support and asked.If you get a bitter aftertaste, you're definitely using too much.  Start with a few drops and go from there.
I use a lot of Cream of Tartar.I make my own baking powder, which requires only a limited amount, but I use it much more for cleaning certain items.I collect vintage cookware.  Often aluminum pots, pans, roasters and etc., have very dark interiors from cooking certain foods.Filling the vessel with water and adding 3 or 4 Tablespoons of Cream of Tartar and boiling the liquid for 20 - 30 minutes (occasionally longer) will bring the aluminum back to the bright, silvery color it was when new.
I use a lot of Black Pepper in my sausage recipes. When I purchase peppercorns in the super market, they cost a small fortune. So these are well worth the price. I have seen Peppercorns that were larger in size but these make up for it in freshness and flavor. If you have one of those empty one quart containers from your Chinese take out? Save it. You will want to store these in the refrigerator. I toast these in a fry pan lightly before use and it brings these to another level. So they are a great buy.
Never thought I'd be reviewing peppercorn! Ever! Heck, I never thought I'd be reading reviews of peppercorn before I buy it but I must say, not only is this peppercorn EXTREMELY FRESH, it has actually shown me what peppercorn should taste like. Until now, I might as well have not bothered. It was disgusting dust I was crushing all over my food, apparently because the Spicy World Peppercorn iS DELICIOUS - the reviews are not kidding. You get a heart-felt 5 star from me, baby! Packaging was awesome and it arrived on time too! Thank you :)!
I love this pepper. It tastes so good and I use it basically on everything. I am very happy with this and was pleasantly surprised when I got it. It has a nice bold taste to it that is really enjoyable. I really love this on veggies because let's be honest veggies are brutally boring. I do force myself to eat a lot of veggies basically to fill my plate and get my stomach full so I don't eat too much meat. This actually makes them very tasty and I will even go as far to say I rather enjoy vegetables....  Yup I said it there ya go this pepper gets my seal of approval.
I enjoy this tea daily with lemon. I had been drinking the stash green tea that isn't organic. I may like the non-organic a bit better but it always depends on the batch. I doubt this compares to fine, whole-leaf, carefully brewed tea but I'm no connoisseur.I put a bag in a travel mug, pour in the hot water, add some reconstituted lemon juice, and I'm happy. If the tea, or any beverage for that matter, were too good, it would distract me from my work, which I would rather not be doing, but I have to eat and pay the bills.
I was disappointed as I could not taste the bergamot like I can in Twinings Earl Grey. It was much better than Bigelow's Earl Grey Green and there was no bitter aftertaste. Maybe I expected it be more like the original Earl Grey. I was hoping that I'd like it as I would get the green tea benefits with the black tea taste, but the flavor still fell flat for me as it did not have the delicacy of Twinings. I think I'll stick to Salada green tea and keep my black tea Earl Grey. Salada doesn't have that hay like taste or the bitter aftertaste that some green teas have and it's inexpensive. Also, Celestial Seasonings has a Mandarin Orchard green tea that's really good.
I love my tea in the afternoon. I have always liked Earle Grey teas even though if I drink alot of it, the bergamot oil bothers my stomach. I also like green teas so when I found this one at my local store I thought I would give it a try. It is very pleasant, accommodating my cream and honey very well. I also feel good about getting benefit from both black and green tea. The price is better on Amazon then in my store and subscribe and save makes it easy for me to continually have it on hand. My closest store is sixteen miles away so this service is appreciated.
I drink Green tea most of the day. After 5:00pm or so I switch to camomile tea. It keeps me calm and promotes better sleep at night.I tried several teas and this is one of my favorite taste-wise.Being a Baby Boomer I am more aware of natural ways to stay healthy and enjoy life. I'm always looking for ways to improve without artificial products.If your nerves get jittery then you want to give this tea a try.Lambert Klein Author ofAnti-Aging for Baby Boomers and Everyone Else Naturally
***This Earl Grey Tea from Stash is plain, and definitely not subtle because of a strong bergamot component---way too strong! If you really, really love bergamot you may like it, but I much prefer a more subtle and more complex tea. It tastes like perfumed black tea; I could hardly drink it. I could not tell the difference between it and Stash's Double Bergamot Black Tea---both are just swimming in oil of bergamot. I am an Earl Grey fan, but just couldn't stomach this tea.It seems like the quality of the black tea is very good, though, because even with a longer brewing time, the tea did not become bitter...so, if you can stand being hit over the head with the bergamot flavor, you might enjoy it.Only recommended for those who want a strongly perfumed bergamot Earl Grey.***
I really like Stash teas; I drink it every day.  This particular flavor is very refreshing, a good combination of giner and lemon give it a nice 'zippy' taste.  I like that it is made from organic teas and ingredients, too.  That is becoming more and more important to me.  I would like to see Stash Tea offer more organic varieties.  However, it's too bad that we have to pay more in order to have fewer artificial chemicals (herbicides, pesticides and chemical fertilizers) but that's the way it is in farming currently.  This tea is definitely worth the extra cost.
I ordered 6 on scribe and save but received only 1. The box was squashed since it was packed with numerous heavy items in a really big box.I won't know until I receive my credit card how I was charged, but it should be free as far as I'm concerned since I did not get what I ordered and the website refused to let me schedule a return.  At least I should be charged 1/6th of what the subscribe and save price was.The tea inside the package is undamaged.
This decaf really disappointed me, esp. given the other glowing reviews.  It does not appear green, nor does it taste "green" (ie: doesn't have that fresh "grassy" flavor many describe as found in an authentic Japanese green tea).  Actually, this could be a good paring with seafood, because  I sometimes detect a slight fishiness in the taste.  Yuk.  Stash Decaf Green, the non-organic, non-premium tea, is actually a little better than this one.  What people like is a matter of personal taste, but I won't ever buy this tea again.
I was looking for an organic green tea that had not been grown in China or Japan.  I contacted Stash and was told this tea originated in Japan, but was grown in Brazil.  This organic green tea is amazing.  My first impression was that it contained a more generous amount of tea than those I had previously made tea with. When I pour boiling water on a tea bag, the green tea blossoms out even without dunking the tea bag.  I found the taste to be smooth and not at all bitter.  A single bag will easily make a small pot of tea.  If you were to seep a single cup for a while, it you might find it a bit strong. This is a notably lovely organic green tea that is grown in Brazil.
A few quick comments:Purchased from Amazon as an add on item w/free shipping. Still fresh.Frontier is a good brand - the spice is a little sweet (from the cinnamon) and a little mild on the heat.  A little heavy on the anise and clove, but good.  A little goes a long way.Ingredients:CinnamonFennelCloveAniseWhite pepperMy only question - where is the Sichuan Pepper?  I guess since it doesn't specifically state "Chinese Five Spice" it doesn't really need to have the peppers.  But you can buy Sichuan powder separately or just add ground habanero or another spicy ground pepper to your dish.Still - couldn't find it at my local Whole Foods so I'm glad Amazon had it for a good price.
I love spicing up various bland foods like rice, potato dishes, with Five-Spice powder.  This is a great, interesting spice that not everyone has been exposed to.  Few recipes call for it, other than Asian ones.  Unfortunately, I live in a small rural town and cannot find this spice in any of the grocery stores.  Thanks to Amazon, I not only can purchase it, but it comes at a fair, competitive price.  Living where I do, Amazon is the only convenient mall I have, and I am so grateful for it.
As another reviewer mentions, this is the flavor missing from today's pizza joints.  It's like a step back in time, three or four decades, when huge shakers of oregano, crushed red pepper, and grated cheese were on every table (without customers having to ask for some).  Using this blend alongside &#34;Go Veggie&#34; Parmesan flavored sprinkle is fabulous.We are dairy free, cook 98% of meals at home, and don't have a salt shaker in the house (don't care for the stuff).  We LOVE and use plenty of spices, and have been sure to keep this blend on hand ever since we first tried it two years ago.  Goes on our marinara sauce, soups, and tomato-based vegetable stew.  Also good when reheating leftovers; it gives a slight change to the flavor when heated into the food instead of just sprinkling on top.
I got some at the World Market before they went out of business and searched a lot of stores as I painstakingly used it sparingly for years thinking I would never find it again.  I have and this is my third jar.  It is terrific and not so citrusy as the copy cats.  Spruces up everything from hamburger helpers to eggs.  I use it on steak & hamburgers along with some salt based seasoning to increase the flavor and not the salt.  It is the best spice for fish ever!
If you follow the instructions on cooking boba/tapioca/bubble tea, the consistency and taste is amazing. The only downside is that the pearls tend to crumble in the bag and are generally fragile before they begin to cook and darken. Also, if the water is not hot enough in the beginning, you get the same problem of the pearls dissolving and things getting a bit messy and/or sticky. If you are patient and dedicated, these are the best choice, but if you want a simpler alternative, try the black minute pearls instead. Less delicate, easy to make, and just as tasty in the end, they are a lovely alternative. It's your choice, though. Either way, boba/tapioca pearls are a deliciously addictive addition to most iced drinks, especially milk teas, but also quite a few juices.
I read the reviews here from other customers, concerning this black bubble tapioca pearls and I learned some people got packages of firm pearls and some customers got old crumbled pearls that are mostly dusty stuff.... my package was mostly dust but i dropped it all into a large pot that had a rolling boil of water and cooked for 25 minutes, then turned off heat , put lid on pot, let sit and cool down for half hour.  I strained the goop off the pearls, then added pearls into condensed milk/extra strong brewed coffee and gave gentle stir....served the drink cold in little glasses with wide mouth straw and our office staff was thrilled with the results.
I did not know what I was buying when I purchased this item. At first I was puzzled that it was not black, after all it is "black" tapioca. I was planning to use the black tapioca in chocolate tapioca pudding. I went ahead and cooked some and discovered it does indeed turn black after cooking. But now I am not sure what to do with it because the package directions are unclear. I did an internet search for some bubble tea recipes which should not be necessary. None the less, the tea looks interesting.
I just received this assortment of candy for the second time and I am quite disappointed. The only reason that I ordered the same one again was that my friend loves rock candy. The rock candy is no longer included, although it is still advertised as being in there.In fact, a lot of the candy that was in there the last time is gone. The pieces that were full sized before are no longer full size and the candy tastes as if it was also made in the sixties and has been sitting around since then, waiting for some sucker to order it. Do yourself a favor and save your money, it is not worth the price they charge at all.
Took me a bit, but I'm a convert after running out and going back to normal tea.  Wasn't obvious at first but became apparent the day I had to switch "cold-turkey."Great flavor, enough caffeine, and no need to add anything.  Will be buying more.vs PGtips and Yorkshire Gold.________________(+) Less astringent(+) Does *not* get bitter with long steeps.(+/-) Caffeine is same as Yorkshire/PG tips(+) Beats yorkshire Gold in flavor (difficult to tell differences if you take sugar/milk/lemon/etc.)
I actually first learned about Barry's tea in a novel I was reading. It piqued my interest enough to try it, but it wasn't available at our local supermarkets, so I ordered a box from Amazon. I'm very pleased with the tea, it's a very robust but smooth, full-bodied black tea that I love to drink straight or with a few drops of lemon juice. I brew a couple of cups a day in a Mr. Coffee machine that I use only for tea, and it makes a great hot drink.
Since its founding in Cork, Ireland, in 1901 Barry&#8217;s Tea has been known for its excellence. Indeed, Barry&#8217;s Tea now accounts for 34% of all tea sales in Ireland. This wonderful tea is a blend of mainly African teas with some Indian teas. It has a nice golden-brown color and a crisp aroma. But, the best thing about it is its taste!This is an excellent black tea, one which I enjoy every chance I get. Also, it not only tastes great hot, but it makes an excellent iced tea. So, if you are looking for a tea that tastes great hot and cold, then get Barry&#8217;s Tea&#8217;s Gold Blend. I highly recommend it.
I have long been a fan of Yorkshire Gold & PG Tips & Typhoo et al. For some reason I never thought anything could be better than the aforementioned blends. I saw Barrys Gold Blend on the shelf of my supermarket and from the first cup it is now my absolute favorite. It is malty, hearty, slightly fruity, assertive, strong and very very tasty. With milk or cream, sweetener or not, you will become spoiled by this drink. Try it and enjoy your new favorite black/breakfast/Irish tea.PS: Barrys Breakfast Blend is slightly less bold (aka: not as strong/smoother) and marketed as "Good for Any Time Of Day". Barrys Breakfast Blend is very good but Barrys Gold Blend is never too over the top for my palate.
I usually buy the Barry's Breakfast Tea, which I think is spectacular.  This time, I tried the Barry's Gold tea (the red box).  It doesn't disappoint.  It's the same flavored tea, just with "something more" in it's richness.  You don't get the sense that you are drinking it to "wake up", but to relax, anytime of day, with a great cup of tea.I don't know what they blend this stuff with, but one of these teas that they blended in must be geared toward relaxation. It doesn't "take the edge off" as Green Tea does, but it comes pretty darned close.  Perfect for people who want to a comforting cup of tea, but don't like herbal or green teas.  It's caffeinated, that's the only difference.I'd call it close to perfection.  I like it better than the green box, actually.
I have ordered Barry's Irish Tea bags in the green box before and loved them, so I decided to try the Barry's Gold Blend tea bags in the red box.  These are just as good!  I love good full bodied tea.  My mother was from england and our family has always enjoyed a good cup of hot tea with milk.  Not just any tea, mind you!  It has to be a very strong bodied, tea.  Barry's is excellent and I appreciate it that Amazon.com carries this tea and at an affordable price too!  :)
Why would a huge plastic container of round cheese balls be selling for over 20 dollars?  Are you kidding me?  And the worst part is that the regular cheese curls are a thousand times crunchier and tastier anyway.  Cheese balls taste rather hard and lack the cheesy flavor in comparison to the actual curls.  Either way expect cheese stains all over your hands, and especially the furniture and Nintendo equipment (including TV and Wii remotes) in the living room.  A product that I fail to see why anyone would consider purchasing considering the many flaws.
Yesterday I wrote to this Seller stzting that I got 4 of these barrels of cheese balls, and each one had an expiration date of 1/07 --- seems like they went through their inventory and sent out everything that was old --- have not heard back from them, so that's why I am writing this.  We give a lot of these out to the kids in the neighborhood as presents.  Today we got another 4 from a Seller --- these 4 barrels had an expiration date of 2/25/12!!!The need to realize that taking old inventory just to get rid of it during the holiday rush doesn't really work --- it's going to be a long time before I order anything from them again...
I had never tried this product before nor heard of it until I came across a vegan recipe I wanted to make.  A small amount adds a lot of flavor.  The first time my husband and I tasted it, we were impressed.  It is better than soy sauce.  Has an all natural mild taste loaded with flavor, but not too salty.  Would be excellent on vegetables, soup or  brown rice.  Liquid Aminos also contains 16 essential and non-essential amino acids.  I had a hard time finding this product in a regular grocery store.  I was delighted Amazon carried it.  I will never go back to soy sauce.
I'm not a fanatic (yet), but I buy organic whenever I can. These seeds sprout readily and take only a few days to grow to tasty green sprouts. Amazing how much more vitamins there are in sprouts than in the finished vegetable or grain. We eat those too, of course, but on sandwiches, these really taste good. Most of the time, price is a reflection of quality and I was concerned that these would not be as good as the others that cost a lot more. Well, I had no cause to worry, these are terrific! There is no need to pay double for good organic sprouting seeds. I have tried every sprouting system on the market, and have found the Easy SprouterSproutamo - Easy Sprout Sprouterthe fastest and, yes, easiest to use.
Hmm. I thought I already did a review on this, but I guess I didn't.I'm very much the novice at sprouting so this is the first one I've tried and I really like the combination.It has the right sweet/hot spicy kick to it and I find myself putting it on almost everything.I sprout using filtered, ionized water and have had great success, I think, so no complaints there as I think using tap water, which even plants and animals don't want, surely wouldn't do well for sprouts. Just my opinion.Happy.
L&auml;kerol licorice pastilles from Sweden are a firm but chewy little button with a strong traditional licorice flavor. The ones in the red box have a distinct menthol taste, which seems to go really well with the taste of licorice. Flavored with xylitol, they are almost calorie free at just 3 calories per pastille. Moreover, they are not just great for flavor. This itself would be enough of a reason to pop one in your mouth from time to time. But they are also good for the throat. Licorice is soothing to the respiratory system. (Many traditional European cough syrups have a licorice base.) And L&auml;kerol, with its strong dose of licorice extract, is no exception. They also are good for the breath. A couple of these pastille last a long time in the mouth and provide the licorice lover with a long-lasting licorice taste.
An update for July 2012Have ordered this assortment 4 times since my original review which I deleted to edit and add a new review.The company is now listing what you get in the package.........................Case of 60 Assorted Snack Size Bags. The snack size bags range from 3/4 oz to 1-1/4 oz. The assortment includes Regular, BBQ, Sour Cream & Onion, Salt & Vinegar, Crab and Kettle Classic potato chips, Thin pretzels, Cheese Curls, White Cheddar popcorn and Party MixI am very glad to see this.Its no longer a wait and see what you get purchase.However you do still get more of some types than others.A very good product but the dates usually range from 4 to 8 weeks.Could be longer but still a great price and the few that I have eaten after the past best by date I could tell no difference.I hope these stay on site for sale because they have become a regular purchase for me.
This the first time I've tried Utz chips.  Never heard of them before.  Wow!  They are delicious.  I haven't tried all the flavors yet -- still working my way through them.  But, I really like the crab flavored ones.  I wasn't sure what they'd be like, but they taste like Old Bay crab boil seasoning (which I really like).  I will definitely reorder these.  Plus you can't beat the price per pack when you compare to what you get out of the office vending machine.
I've had nothing but wonderful experiences with this lotion over the years. At times it IS the only lotion that can handle super tough dry skin issues on faces (and scalp for you men) while being super gentle. Recently recommended it to someone who used it on his face after shaving and said it stung horribly. I could see the redness reaction. Within a couple of weeks this settled down, but I was surprised at the initial reaction. Speaks to the necessity of a regular moisturizing regime for anyone, I suppose.
Jason Vanilla Hand and Body Therapy is a great stand-by because it is a rich, moisturizing lotion that doesn't leave skin greasy or slimy.  It leaves skin soft and smooth - I use it to moisturize my hands each night before going to bed and wake up with soft, moisturized skin. The one thing that I don't love about it is the scent that tends to linger for a few minutes after applying the lotion (while the vanilla scent is delicate, there is a bit of a musky smell at first until the lotion dries - after that, there is no odor, and the vanilla aroma is faint and pleasant).
When and actually every time you reach into this box you do not know what your getting. You will not be disappointed though, because the surprise is worth the suspense!!! These Chocolates are as good as any of the Best Chocolates out there. If your a Dark Chocolate lover buy these for yourself or give as a present to someone who will appreciate the thoughtfulness of you and Leonidas.I know what I will be buying for Mothers day and Valentines day and again for myself when I finish these.  Good Luck.PS you may want to check if they deliver these in the Summer Time because of the Temps.
I really didn't know much about this type of chocolate and took a chance and got a box.  This was a Christmas present for my wife but after all the good stuff we read we had to break into it a month early.  I thought to myself how much differently could this really taste than the American chocolate I am used to.  It comes in a box that you get to unwrap and untie the bow.  This chocolate is the best ever and after tasting and finishing off the entire box we couldn't wait to get another.  That will have to wait though for the price but it was worth what we paid.  Do yourself a favor and pay the price just to try it out.
These are definitely "mid-range" chocolates, not quite as good as Godiva or See's. If you're used to low-end chocolates like Fannie May or Russell Stover, you'll probably find these to be very good. However, if you're used to very good chocolates like La Maison du Chocolat, you'll be sorely disappointed.I found the chocolate to have unexceptional flavor and a somewhat waxy texture. The fillings were mostly very sweet or alcoholic, which is a common practice to cover up mediocre chocolate.I guess they're a good value compared to Godiva, although I think See's Candies has an even better value. Don't expect Leonidas to compare to a high-end chocolatier.
This was a very high quality flour - superfine and so great for making non-gritty gluten-free foods. If you can afford the cost, including shipping, you will want to spend the extra to get this product. However, with the amount of GF baking I do, the cost of this product was just too high for us. We now use our VitaMix dry-grains container to grind Lundberg organic brown rice into our own rice flour. We order that here on Amazon, and it's grown in CA so it has no arsenic contamination like rice from other areas. After grinding, we sift it to make sure all the grit is gone. It's not quite as fine as this product, but for the price difference, it's what we are doing for now.
This is the rice flour for gluten-free cooking.  Unlike other rice flours, the super-fine grind is not gritty so baked goods can have the same smooth finish as those made from wheat flours.  If tightly wrapped, it keeps indefinitely in the freezer so one can afford to buy it in bulk.  I also highly recommend Authentic Foods' superfine brown rice flour and gluten-free flour blend.  My wheat-eating husband says the cinnamon rolls I baked with it are the best he's ever eaten, wheat or no wheat, gluten or no gluten.  If you've been disappointed with other brands, as we were, you really should try this.
My uses for this flour have been gluten-free pancakes, cakes, muffins, and cornbread. It's true, this flour is more finely ground than most white rice flours that are commercially available--even those that say they are very fine. If you bake gluten-free, you know sometimes the texture can be gritty despite your best efforts.  Breads and cakes can turn out flavorful, but dense, overly heavy, and still crumbly. My recipes turn out much smoother, lighter, and fluffier with this flour. I cut it in conjunction with others depending on the recipe, and it's turned out great results each time.It doesn't cost much more than grocery store brands, but the final result is worth the slight increase in price. Definitely recommend this flour for gluten-free baking.
I purchase this mayonnaise regularly, usually more than one bottle at a time. I use it for making Japanese dynamite sauce, although it is very nice in sandwiches as well. This mayonnaise has a flat taste to it, and is not at all sweetened like American-style mayonnaise.The product is tops but the packaging is a little odd. The mayonnaise itself comes in a squeeze bottle, and the squeeze bottle is packaged in the red-printed cellophane bag you see in the picture. Well, when you remove the bottle from the cellophane bag, you are left with a plain bottle, with no markings on it whatsoever. You will know what is in the squeeze bottle, but others won't, so you just need to communicate that to anybody that has access to your refrigerator.A nice little bonus is that the cap on the squeeze bottle has a rosette tip, so you can make fancy little mayonnaise decorations straight out of the bottle if the occasion arises.
I took a chance on this mayonnaise, hoping that it would not contain soy oil --- because the ingredients are not listed in the description of this product.  So much to my dismay, I found out after the mayonnaise arrived that it does indeed contain soy oil  --- and worse, it contains MSG.The product may, in fact, be wonderful for some people.  But you should be aware that this product contains soybean oil and MSG --- which some people, cannot tolerate for medical reasons.Downgraded to three stars for hiding the ingredients.The ingredients only show up on the cello wrapper and do not appear on the plastic container itself.  So here is a the list of the ingredients so thoughtful buyers can make an intelligent decision without guessing or having to take a chance:***** Ingredients: Vegetable Oil (Canola Oil, Soybean Oil), Egg Yolk, Vinegar, Salt, Monosodium Glutamate (MSG), Spice, Natural Flavor, Contains Egg. *****
I've wanted to try Kewpie &#34;Japanese&#34; mayonnaise for a while, having read about it on a lot of recipe sites. People speak so highly of it that I was really curious, but I couldn't find it anywhere locally.The flavor is not what I expected, it is much eggier and tangier than regular Hellman's mayonnaise. Th flavor is somehow also lighter, and doesn't linger as much in your mouth. It is much less oily.I love the fine-tipe squirt bottle, especially for Japanese food. It makes it easier to &#34;frost&#34; food as a topping. I don't know that I would call it a replacement for regular American mayonnaise, and I'm not particularly fond of it with meat, like on a sandwich. But it gives a great tangy creaminess to veggies, sushi, omelets, and sauces.
I always used to hate mayonnaise, and couldn't imagine using it as a regular condiment.  Turns out I just hated American mayonnaise.Japanese mayonnaise is made with rice vinegar and a spice called ajinomoto, which gives it a hint of the flavor called umami.  Umami is a special flavor, found mainly in Asian cooking, that can be detected by the human tounge outside the four basic tastes of sweetness, sourness, bitterness and saltiness.  Japanese mayonnaise is much better for cooking, especially for making salad dressings.  That hint of umami makes all the difference.Kewpie brand is the most popular brand of Japanese mayonnaise, and so it is a bit of a comfort food like Heinz ketchup is to Americans.  Aside from tasting great, it is just nice to see the familiar bottle sitting in the fridge, knowing you can pull it out at any time and make your tacoyaki taste just that much better.
I almost didn't try this because I bought the Walden Farms chocolate sauce and marshmallow sauce several years ago and they were awful.  But thanks to Amazon reviews, I decided enough people liked the salad dressings that I should give them a chance.I found this at my local Fred Meyer (Kroger family) for a few pennies over $5.  The FM stores in Boise have a little diet food section, and that's where I found it.  I bought the Bacon Ranch, and I must say it's pretty good.  I had a full bowl of salad with plenty of dressing (I like lots!) for just 20 calories.  Very cool!I wonder how this would taste on shiritaki (yam) noodles?  I think I'll try that tomorrow.
in an effort to watch my caloric intake and stay more or less carb free i've been searching for products to add to my collection of foods that will help me achieve my weight loss/ health goals ...I've tried a lot of WF products and i find them all pretty much the same....super fake tasting. That said, i suppose they add a good fake flavor to salads and the like, but i'd rather just find something with maybe a few calories/fat etc and eat that than this completely chemical processed stuff ....Good luck to folks who love it....but this and all WF are just not for me.
I love this dressing. I use it pretty much with everything. This year I decided to get serious about my weight (and lost 23 lbs by the way)and with some pokes from my friends I went to HCG diet (along with those friends). In my doc office I was introduced to Walden Farms products, although I've never heard of them before. Being an on and off dieter since I can remember, that would be shame on me. I am in love with their products now. Well, most of them. This Russian dressing is one of my favorites along with Chocolate dip. I use it with everything. Cucumbers, tomatoes, spinach. It goes well with everything. It tastes good, it's light and calorie free. And I might get addicted to low calorie eating after all. Dieting becomes fun when it tastes good.
The other reviews of the Walden Farms BBQ Sauce made it sound like something you would scrape off the bottom of your shoe, wipe on your meat and promptly barf.  I, however was pleasantly surprised to find the Original Sauce to be very tasty.  The spice level was well balanced with the acidity and sweetness.  No chemical aftertaste of Splenda.  I am a foodie, but my doctor has me on a ridiculously low calorie diet for the next few months.  After the past three weeks, I was desperate for variety and this fit the bill perfectly!  Bare in mind, this is NOT regular barbeque sauce though.  It is thinner, but what would you expect from a no calorie, no carb sauce?  If you are needing variety in your menu, give this a try.  You might just find an unexpected delight!
This is an acquired taste - you might not even like it at first. It is not vinegary like some of the WF products. I'd describe it as more robust, spicy enough for a guy who loves heat, and smoky. My wife isn't a fan, but she's not on a diet or willing to give it a chance. She doesn't like smoky food, either. I can say that after two or three meals it has grown on me and it is a staple as long as I'm on Atkins.
It's not just THIS Walden Farms product, but every one I've tried. Syrups, marshmallow dip, Ketchup, Cocktail sauce.....!! You'd think after wasting so much money on them (not to mention the taste that leaves your mouth feeling like a chemical sewer!) I'd learn but kept hoping ONE item would be salvageable. No. They are so bad I almost considered gargling with bleach to erase the taste. There are no words for what these Walden products taste like: not any that can be printed on Amazon, at any rate. (shudder)
Give Walden Farms credit for making a no-carb sauce. It's just a shame it doesn't taste better. Still, I do buy it on occasion and mix it with other tastier sauces to lower the over all carb content. However, the smoke taste is so overwhelming that more than a proportion of 1:4 leaves only the taste of this product in your mouth. This product cannot begin to compare with the taste of the now-defunct Kraft's low-carb barbecue sauce. Mostly, I make my own low-carb sauce from scratch and then just add a bit of this to get the smoke taste, but too much and even the best batch of homemade sauce is ruined. However, if you are on an extreme low-carb diet (such as Dr. Bernstein's) this may be the only product that fits.
I buy this now and then at a local grocery store. It is pretty good stuff. It is not as good as real sugar type syrups, but for a no sugar and very low carb, low calorie product, I have not found anything that beats it. It is not quite as thick as regular syrup, but it is not far off.It uses sucralose as a sweetener.I emailed and asked. They told me it is 0.4 carbs and 4 calories per serving. But for this product the serving size is a generous 1/4 cup.So I give it 5 stars for what it is - a low carb, low calorie maple syrup substitute.Where I get it, it is almost $5 a bottle, and there are just 6 servings per bottle, so it is kind of pricey. I don't use a lot of it, but I have been using it for several years now and while they changed the label at least once that I recall, the syrup is just as good as ever.
This oil has a rancid, off-putting odor that smells NOTHING like coconut, more like yeast.  It also has a TERRIBLE taste.  DO NOT BUY!!!I consume a jar of coconut oil a week because I take it as a supplement and cook with it.  Jarrow, Spectrum, Nutiva, Vitacost and Swanson are MUCH better.  Their coconut oils smell really good with a fresh, coconut scent and taste great too.I was surprised because I use other NOW products and am happy with them. The quality, judging by my experience & others', is that this may just be a faulty jar but the quality isn't consistent.  I don't see bad reviews from the other oils I use & I have never had a bad batch from the others I have mentioned.
If you are interested in using this as a dietary supplement you should buy in bulk. You would have to take more than half the bottle at one time just to receive the daily dietary benefits. This is 10 times more expensive than buying in bulk and either taking with a spoon or adding it to your food. I am fond of NOW's products but this is just a response to a uneducated consumer demand. SO GET EDUCATED! It is your health! Find a much better online bulk price and buy it by the gallon or better and you will be feeling and looking better!
My primary reason for buying this product was to help my digestive system.  I have iron deficiency anemia, but I could not tolerate any brand of iron supplement, and the shots were extremely painful. So I became extremely anemic and needed transfusions. Consequently, I couldn't take a chance anymore on not using iron tablets and I had to find a way to take them without suffering.Because I use coconut oil and milk in my cooking and for skin/hair care, I've done research on the benefits of this amazing seed, and I thought that these capsules might help me to tolerate iron tablets.  Well they have, and I am now able to tolerate 3 daily doses of ferrous sulfate, so I'm in compliance with my doctors orders and my hemoglobin level is rising.
I haven't been taking these very long to post a review on quality and whatnot. I will say that the pills are a bit much to swallow. They are big, however they don't go down too bad. I have a hard time taking pills and when I opened the bottle I was like "holy s***" thinking that I wouldn't be able to get em down. I managed, but it does take me a minute to work up to it. So if you have any issues with swallowing pills, these are rather big, but they are softgels so I'm sure that helps.
Purchased this and Flaxseed Oil to help punch up my HDL "good" cholesterol levels. Not sure how it is working yet but they seem to work fine and I feel better taking them. We also use Coconut oil in bulk form for cooking as the fat composition is supposed to be better for you than other vegetable oils. As for capsules, I have read other reviews that say these "taste bad".... but I have never had this problem. Because they are capsules I am unsure how anyone could taste them anyway, unless they were punctured or chewed. They are rather large capsules, but they go down fine. I would recommend them.
Bought these for stocking stuffers, taste is fine, but not as smooth or creamy as Lindt milk Chocolate, first taste is a little waxy, and the after taste is sweet and slightly granular.... price was reasonable, although I wouldn't send for them again as I can buy Lindt for the same price locally, hard to compare the ingredient list as these are made in Europe. My First impression is that when a European Chocolate maker thought of as the best was bought by an American Company, something in the ingredients may have been altered........... my opinion...Overall, it is a fine, nice tasting milk chocolate..... wouldn't necessarily call it the Worlds Best... but I am sure the friends I am giving these to will be pleased..!
I sent these to my cousin who said she needed chocolate to get through the stress of a serious health issue (she thought she might lose her sight).  She said these did the trick wonderfully.  She carried a bar in her purse to every doctor's appointment and fortified herself with creamy goodness before every painful procedure.  She told me that the only way she could cope with the  laser surgeries and having needles inserted into her eyes was knowing that she could eat a whole bar of this chocolate when it was over.  That's some powerful chocolate!Thankfully, her last appointment showed no more problems with her retina and the doctor said she should recover fully with no permanent lose of vision.  She said she's going to use some of the remaining bars in baking cookies.  She thinks the creamy almost caramel-like taste will be wonderful in chocolate chunk cookies.  Hope she sends me some.
ive been using this product for the past month or so.  i have 2 dogs and a cat.  it does nothing for flea control.  infact, in seems like they have more fleas now than before.  i think the fleas love the garlic!  the dogs love the taste of the chewable tabs.  the dogs breath smells like garlic.  i'll continue to use the product cause the dogs love the "treat" so much.  but wont buy it again for flea control.
I've only been giving my poodle mix (15 lbs.) these capsules for like two weeks now but I'm already considering stopping them. They haven't really done much to help the fleas and I think they might be harming him because he's been drinking too much water. On account of all the water he drinks he has to go pee A LOT and wakes me up in the middle of the night. I'm worried that the pills might be affecting his kidneys so I think I'm going to stop giving them to him. That's too bad because I was really excited to give these to my pet since the reviews are really good. Although I did see some possitve changes in him it hasn't been enough to outdo the possible negative consequences. I also read that brewers yeast can cause bloating so I'm not sure this is such a good idea after all. Has anybody else experienced this?
Brewers yeast with garlic is great for your dog or cat. It helps keep fleas from being as bad as they could be. You would still need to treat the pet for fleas using some other method.  Also, garlic is a homeopathic cure for internal parasites, namely worms.  My dog was having recurring problems catching worms until I started giving her the Brewers yeast with garlic.  She loves them too. Most dogs and cats love brewers yeast. If the pet doesn't want to take the first one you can put it in their mouth. That's usually all it takes to get them to like them.  I've had that experience with about 4 of the cats I've had in the past. After the initial force feeding of the pill, my cats would almost fight each other over them and saw them as treats.  :)
My cats really like these.  I give it to them as treats, one a day mixed with their other crunchy treats. However, I have bought this same brand many times and the tablets vary slightly in smell (maybe taste?), color and texture, batch to batch.  But my cats eat it up nonetheless.  To make it easier for my cats to eat, I usually break each tablet in two, just with my hands.Also, it really does help keep the fleas away....no problems here.  And if you combine this with diatomaceous earth- this is the one I've used before- http://amzn.to/1kTS2VE then they should be flea resistant.  The fleas won't stand a chance.
I have fallen in love with these cookies!They taste almost the same as Newman's sandwich cookies, just without the filling. Crunchy, chocolaty, and just the perfect size. And at 120 calories for a serving, they aren't too waist enhancing.The main reason I am in love with them is the fact that they don't have any corn in them (I'm allergic to corn). This is something that not too many cookie makers consider when making their products.Yet another Newman's Own product to add to our ever growing pantry of products.Pros:Chocolaty enough to satisfy chocoholics.Crunchy and have a good texture.Cons:Far too many Qs and not enough vowels, it's like playing Scrabble! :P
MY FAVORITE COOKIES! I love Oreos without the cream and these are perfect. They taste just like the ice-box cake cookies sold in the larger flat cookies, too.... BUT.....I need to know exactly what "natural flavoring" is because I react horribly to MSG and similar glutamate heavy "altered 'natural' foods" that are allowed by the FDA. I am trying to eliminate even small amounts from my diet to prevent future effects that build up with the trace amounts you get in each item.  The FDA allows many flavor enhancing trace chemicals that have the same effects as glutamates on people.... but they don't have to specifically list them and it leaves me in a tough spot for enjoying packaged foods :(I can't wait to start chomping these again!!  :)
After googling these and seeing that some people are obsessed with the arrowroot variety, I thought I would give them a try. They taste basically like graham crackers or maybe animal crackers with strong taste of honey. It's great that they have no trans fats, minimal chemical ingredients, are mostly organic, and "non-profit"; but they're nothing to get excited about. The hard texture is a pro/con in that it forces you to eat carefully, and limits your desire to gorge. These are good non-lethal commercial cookies, but like all commerical cookies are lacking in nutrition and taste.
Contrary to other reviews Newman O's are better than Oreo's. Every person that I've given them to has thought they are better (I lie and say they are an improved Oreo). What's more I think they are more like Oreo's used to be when I was a kid, I don't remember them having hydrogenated oil or being disgusted eating the filling as I am now.The bottom line is the cookie is exactly the same and the creme filling is the same minus the Crisco shortening.Why buy them? They taste better, they have NO transfats or Fructose (just good old sucrose), profits go to charity, and they are organic (which means they have little or no pesticides and are grown by sustainable methods)
People with Celiac Disease need to notice that although these cookies come up in a gluten free cookies search, they are NOT gluten free - they are made with barley flour which is not safe for CD folks.  I would like to see Amazon fix this problem so that items like this will not come up in gluten free searches.  Newly diagnosed Celiac people may not notice the "error" and get sick.  Please fix this problem, Amazon.  Note: My rating is only because the post requires me to rate the item to post, not because I have tried the cookies; therefore it is not a true rating.
I originally purchased these for my daughter who is wheat free (among other things). I noticed that I was having to purchase them more frequently so I put them on the Subscribe and Save. That was very convenient. Later I realized why they were going so quickly, when I saw my husband and little boy each had a handful. I asked my husband if he realized they where wheat free he said yes but that they were still good. My daughter gets mad when they eat "her" cookies but since they were coming regularly she has learned to share.The cookie part is very crunchy (more so than Oreos) and has a nice chocolaty taste. The creme filling tastes just like oreos to me.Unfortunately, Amazon just took them off subscribe and save. I'm so not happy about that!
I know. . I'm reviewing the product here - its terrific! Costs nearly $5 in stores here and worth every penny from Amazon.My only gripe is that it took forever for these to arrive and when they did they were pretty battered and many of the cookies inside the box are broken up. I love having my kids eat these instead of Oreo's etc but they don't seem to go for broken cookies. Go figure.Anyway, the cookies are great, Love Paul Newman but if you aren't prepared for some broken ginger o's you're better off picking them up in a store
This is one of my favorite indulgences from one of my favorite companies. These are better than the name brand originator of the sandwich, and well worth the price. Convenience of Amazon subscription helps a bit, as does the discounted price and home delivery. This item light just be the best of its kind ... I can't think of any other that tastes as good ... I like to eat them slowly and savor all the flavor. But be careful ... watching an engrossing movie at the same time might cause you to eat the whole pack without realizing how many you've consumed ... until you reach for another and they're all gone. ;-)
When we discovered Newman-O's a few weeks back, we were happy to find a healthier version of Oreos.  Oreos contain high fructose corn syrup, which my husband simply cannot tolerate, so many packaged cookies have been off of our list for awhile.  But, Newman-O's have saved the day!PROS:- Taste great!- Crunchy cookie that has a great chocolate flavor.- Sweet creamy center with exceptionally smooth cream.- Great dunked in milk.- No high fructose corn syrup.- Contains organic ingredients, and nothing artificial (big plus, there).- Don't crumble easily, cookies are mostly whole in the packaging tray.CONS:- Bag isn't resealable, so cookies must be placed into another bag or container to prevent staleness.- Taste too good, serving size is too small!We love Newman-O's.  They taste great and are better for the body than Oreo's or any other knock-off store brand.
But... then I found chocolate peanut butter Newman-O's and everything was right with the world again... in terms of cookie satisfaction, that is.I prefer to pull two of them apart, eating the two naked cookie halves - then smash the two halves w/peanut butter together to make a "double stuff" Newman-O.  In my humble opinion there is no finer store-bought cookie enjoyment experience available on Earth at the current time.This is what you wave under my nose to make sure I'm REALLY dead.
Tazo's "Refresh" tea definitely lives up to its name.  The tea is caffeine-free, which is great for those of us who get jittery after just a little bit of caffeine.  It contains peppermint, spearmint, and tarragon, which leave a pleasant, refreshing aftertaste in your mouth.  I love this tea hot on a chilly winter day, but it's also great iced.  Definitely my favorite Tazo tea, and one of the most versatile.Overall, I highly recommend Tazo "Refresh" tea for anyone looking for a fresh, minty tea.  This is sure to become a household favorite.
I thought I'd try this grain after reading about it's health benefits. I am a big fan of quinoa and millet, and amaranth seemed similar enough. I ordered through subscribe and save and got a good price. The product is good quality and came packaged appropriately. The problem I had with it is the SMELL. This grain cooks up like cream of wheat or malto meal, however, the smell is horrible.....kinda musky, kinda earthy, downright off-putting. I tried masking this with cinnamon and vanilla. I tried mixing the grain with steel cut oats. No matter what, the pungent and specific smell of amaranth overpowers the taste and any enjoyment of the product. I could only get through half and bag and the whole lot went into the garbage. That being said, if you love the smell/texture/taste of amaranth, arrowhead mills is a good company to buy it from.
I ordered this grain because I am following the Ultra Metabolism 21 day detox phase...ok, stop the eye rolling. It's basically about removing potential allergens (diary, etc.) and cleansing yourself from processed foods -any sugar, hydrogenated oils, white flour...and although I dont eat that stuff in general, it's amazing how many "all natural" foods have high fructose corn syrup (many Marie's dressings, etc.)Anywho- my amaranth arrived quickly but one bag had burst open - the packaging was a joke! Amazon shrinkwraps books so they sre sealed air-tight, yet bags of grain soar freely in their big Amazon box, begging to explode.The other bags remained in tact - the stench from the grain takes getting used to. It smells swampy to me, but my sister says that's just "earthy."It's a complete grain and it cooks up nicely as a hot cereal - and it pops like popcorn, too.
I purchased Amaranth because of the health benefits.  Unlike the majority of people who use this in place of rice or in baking, I purchased it to make popcorn and it's yummy.  Make sure you do NOT use a non stick pan.  Make sure it is very HOT before placing 1 TBS of Amaranth in the pan.  If it doesn't pop immediately your pan isn't hot enough.  Immediately remove your pan from the stove and shake shake shake so it doesn't burn.  Very tasty treat.  Keep in mind alot of the seeds won't pop but they are still very tasty.
I've been eating a palmful in the morning, and again at night. I just love crunching them between my teeth! It's like it's a treat or something...lol. Anyway, they are fresh and they taste good. I've noticed my skin has improved dramatically since I started eating them. My fine lines are barely there, no dry patches now, and I have a dewy glow. Since I hate any type of seafood and omega 3 capsules make me break out, this is my only way of getting that healthy fatty acid. I dare say my energy is better as well. I will definetly keep buying these.
Despite a foray into peppermint and chamomile tea as a youth (following my father's lead), I've never been an avid hot tea drinker. I read about this tea in Best Life magazine and decided to give it a try for the claimed health benefits of rooibos tea. Healthy or not, this tea is delicious. I drink at least two cups a day, plus a Thermos-ful at work. I prefer it with a shot ofMadhava Pure Organic Raw Agave Nectar. It would be nice if I could get a caffeinated version, but I guess I'll have to stick toLipton Black Pearl Teafor that.
Ah, it's a definitely American story - in 1969 friends Mo Siegel and Wyck Hay of Colorado began selling the herbal teas that they had previously only made for themselves. From such small beginnings came that famous tea company - Celestial Seasonings.Among Celestial Seasonings' many products is an absolutely wonderful, naturally decaffeinated herbal infusion - Madagascar Vanilla Red. This tea is based on South African red tea, made with rooibos (pronounced "roy-boss") leaves, and includes delicious Madagascar vanilla. It tastes great either hot or iced - deliciously vanilla-filled, with a nutty subtaste that makes this tea a great way to end the evening.By the way, I have found that the best way to drink this tea is hot, with sugar and milk, accompanied by fresh-out-of-the-oven chocolate chip cookies. Mmm Mmm Good!
I started eating this candy when I was pregnant with my son about 3 years ago.  It really helps with nausea and I always keep a pack with me.  This also makes a great cup of ginger tea.  Just put 2 to 3 of the candies in a cup and pour hot water on them.  Start stirring and when they are mostly or completely dissolved, you have a great cup of ginger tea.  No need to add sugar or anything else.  I have morning sickness again and am constantly eating this candy and making tea with it.  I introduced my mother-in-law to it and she loves it now as well.  The cup of tea can also help when your stomach hurts and with indigestion.FYI: Do not try to peel off the second wrapping on the candy.  You can eat it since it is made of clear thin rice paper.  The rice paper also dissolves in the hot water when making your ginger tea.
Having not been to the place where other folks have tried this, I'm guessing the market is a lot of the charm with this tea.  Its ok, but its not the greatest tea I've ever had.  It is spicy, and its sweet, but I prefer to control my own tea sweetness.  I'm happy that others have found a tea they enjoy, but this one just isn't it for me.  I will finish my box but not sure if I will get more.
As a classic Seattle tea, this tea brings back memories of hiding away from the rainy weather sipping a delicious naturally sweet cinnamon citrus tea. When I drink this tea, I am home again. This tea has a unique personality that seems to embody the entire mood of Seattle in one cup.This is a delicious tea that should be brewed for at least 5 minutes to bring out all the flavors. You can sweeten this more if you like with Stevia or a natural sugar to enhance the natural sweetness. It is good with a touch of Muscovado Sugar from India Tree.~The Rebecca Review
Market Spice tea was introduced to me quite by accident. I attended a bridal shower and ended up with a tea & coffee prize basket. Tucked inside was a sample packet of Market Spice Cinnamon Orange tea. I was instantly addicted when I sipped my first cup. No sugar, no calories and sweet as can be. I usually drink the regular and today tried the decaf for the first time, it's just as good as the regular. This stuff is amazing. I've ordered several times this year and will continue to drink this as long as its available. One teabag is strong enough for a BIG mug, sweet from start to finish. It's perfect.
I have been making Turkish coffee for 15 years now. After having the best cup of coffee in my life at a Greek restaurant I asked the waiter what brand he used. I bought a bag immediately and have been converted. I had my coffee ground fresh at middle eastern markets for years both in the U.S., Lebanon and Jordan.Only a few times was I able to get this amazing taste in the Mid East but never here.My husband who is Middle Eastern loves this so much he went from a cup a week to two cups a day. Its a very difficult thing to get a Middle Eastern person to say any kind of food or drink is better than what there own country produces.Because I make this in the Turkish method I use 1 heaping teaspoon for a smaller Turkish coffee cup. I noticed the Greek preparation uses a cup double that size with the same amount of coffee so its not quite as potent that way.
I&#8217;ve grown up with Vegeta as one of the &#8220;essential&#8221; spices. Once I moved to the US it became almost impossible to come by, and only brought here occasionally after a trip to Croatia. It&#8217;s a very flavorful spice that can serve as a salt substitute. It adds some complexity and richness to your savory dishes. I am glad that it&#8217;s becoming increasingly available in stores, even in some small and out of the way places. However, I know that I can&#8217;t count on it being available wherever I go, and therefore I am really excited to have it available through Amazon. It is reasonably priced, especially considering that it&#8217;s a heavy-ish product. Thanks to Amazon Prime I was able to get it in just a couple of days. One tin usually lasts me several months so I will not need another one for a while. Overall, extremely satisfied with both the product and the service.
I was trying to find a kind of rice tea that I've had at Korean restaurants in the past. I thought this might be it, but it's not.  What I did discover was that barley tea tastes exactly, yes exactly!, like twig tea, which is one of my favorite teas.  Kind of a coffee bean flavor. Note that I'm not a fan of coffee, so I don't say it tastes like coffee.  Rather, it tastes like how coffee beans smell.  And like twig tea, it's caffeine free.So depending on the price, you might want to research which is the better deal since twig and barley are virtually identical.  Of course, this barley tea comes packaged in a HUGE bag.  I only make 1 cup at a time so I prefer the regular, smaller tea bags, but it's no big deal just reusing this big bag for cup after cup.
I don't add any purchased salad dressings. Being Greek I follow the greek style salad dressing: olive oil, lemon, salt and herbs in all my salads, not only in the greek salad. I was using fresh and/or dry herbs. And when I found this Herbamare salt I loved it. It has all of the herbs I was adding to my salad, but additional ones that taste great in salads.You can also add it to your rice, to your vegetables, to your meats, etc, etc. It gives a great, light, pleasant flavor to everything you add it on. It doesn't have an overwhelming taste.Everybody that tastes my salads loves them and asks me how I make them. I tell them the secret is the salad dressing. The simpler and most natural the better. I tell them about my Herbamare and now they are all buying it for their salads. And of course, I keep buying.The best part I like about this product: it is organic!!!!
I've been using Herbamare for years; I first discovered it in a health food store and have buying it ever since. I love the fact that this fine sea salt (originating from Switzerland and now manufactured in France), is infused with 13 different organic herbs and veggies. The flavor of the blend is so satisfying, I use less salt; I put Herbamare on everything, from fish to veggies...I even got my mother hooked on the taste! The 500 gram (1.1 lb.) price on Amazon is better than my local health food stores, so I have been buying it here. So many glowing reviews...there's a reason for it! Try this salt; it will become a staple in your kitchen too.Just an FYI; the container I just received has a June 2016 expiration date, which provides me with over 2 years time to consume, but I doubt very highly if the container will be around that long...:)
I have been consistently disappointed in the various Lavazza blends that I have tried.  My last hotel/travel interface with poor quality ground Lavazza pods has resulted in a new addition to my cosmetic bag-- a little Ziplock full of Senseo brand pods, which are decent if not superlative, fairly common in stores, and will accomodate many coffee coffee makers.  I thought the last Lavazza incident was just a bad batch, but it's statistically unlikely that it should keep happening every time.  If you have had better luck with specific blends, bless you, but I think it's not my crappy Karma, but their crummy coffee.  Just my two cents; your mileage may vary.  I use coffee to pry open the eyelids and I need to hit the ground running, so the first cup has to be acceptable.  Life is to short to drink dishwatery coffee.Senseo Douwe Egberts Coffee Pods, Variety Pack, 16-Count Packages (Pack of 4)
Do you love the charred flavor of Starbucks at $4 a pop for a thimbleful of overpriced swill?  Then you'll feel like a Mensa genius after trying Lavazza Crema e Aroma Beans. This price is genuinely a bargain if you shop around the internet.  Even if you're using a $20 grinder with a whirly bird blade and a Sam's Club espresso machine, your toes will curl with a brew of these beans.  No I don't work for these guys.  But if you really love your morning espresso or cappuccino smooth and hearty you'll love Lavazza. Just be prepared for friends start dropping by and mooching a fix once word gets out.
These are good - but not great - coffee beans.  I like a bit of a "bite" from my coffee, and prefer a really good French Roast - of which many are not "really good." Starbucks French Roast is one of the most consistent, but even their outrageously high-priced blend has disappointed me of late. The Lavazza is a more mellow blend, which I find drinkable but without that morning "slap in the face" you get from a heartier roast. Does that make sense?
I have been buying YamaMotoYama for quite a few years, but had never tried this particular tea.  I really like it and actually prefer it over their regular green tea or the GenMai Cha that I've been drinking lately.  I would still keep the other types of tea on hand, but this Hoji Cha is good for a substitute for coffee in the morning - it has a deeper taste than regular green tea.I just wish it was sold in those large 90 count packages - 16 tea bags doesn't last very long and those large packages are usually a better value.  :o}
It has a light, sweet, flowery taste and fragrance to match. The taste and scent is calming and relaxing.They come in aluminum sealed tea bags, which maintains freshness.I've never had Jasmine tea before until I ordered this off Amazon. I wasn't really sure what to expect from a flower flavored tea. But since it doesn't cost that much and I can add it on to any order of $25, I gave it a try. It's really good. I've become a fan of most Yamamotoyama teas.
I figured the box would at least be the size of my hand...not quite. It's very small, and the chocolates inside even smaller. One reviewer called them &#34;bite-sized&#34;...this is maybe 1/4 the size of a bite I would take, and I have a pretty small mouth. So I wouldn't call these bite-sized. Each piece is maybe half the size of a penny.As for the taste...well, they taste pretty good. The strawberry is painfully artificial, but it could be worse. There's something the Japanese do to the artificial strawberry flavoring that makes it addictive. The little chocolates will melt in your mouth for sure.Also don't order this in the summer like me. Of course they were all melted and the box was oily with melted chocolate. It's not going to come with cold packs because it ships from Japan.
I got these out of curiosity- I like Meiji brand chocolates but had only really had the mushroom-  and bamboo-shaped ones. The box is pretty small (and rather banged up, but it didn't affect the contents.) Its quite difficult not to eat the whole thing in one sitting. The chocolate has a sweet dark chocolate flavor, but not overly sweet. The strawberry flavor is more of a hint, but strong enough to still know its there. Overall it was a nice balanced flavor. I would get them again! I wish they were easier to come by locally.
These are very small and a light tannish color. They are not at all like the ones I used to grow in my back yard. I tasted a spoonful of these seeds and had to spit them back out. They were the epitome of staleness. I expected tasty seeds based on the super high price but these are a loser.  I guess I will have to go back to growing my own.I put this bag of seeds into my bird feeders and during this unusually cold freeze and lots of snow there are more birds hanging around the feeders then I have seen in years. They are not as picky as I am and they gobbled up the seeds in a NY minute. I give the seeds an extra star because the birds ate them all up. These seeds are clearly not worth the price and especially not for bird food. I buy 35 pound bags of black sunflower seed at BJ's for around 30 bucks and the birds love them. Don't buy these stale Now Foods seeds.
I had been very hesitant to try this product because of the "no calorie" claim, and some bad reviews that I've read but, I decided to give it a chance. I tried it with strawberries and lo and behold it is pretty darn good. I definitely wouldn't advise eating it on it's own, it's not like chocolate in the sense that it can hold it's own but it gives a nice illusion of chocolate when paired with other things. I look forward to seeing what else it is good with, but for anyone on a diet I would highly recommend it. This has become one of my diet food staples.
The Walden Farms Chocolate Dip was a good find for me, but perhaps calling this "Chocolate" was a mistake since it only slightly resembles chocolate by looks and taste. It should be treated as a dessert dip/topping for dieters or diabetics. Being a Type 2 diabetic, I am always looking for low carb sweets that will not impact my blood sugar levels and this Dip/Topping has no impact at all.I like the flavor and use it to augment fruits and other sugar free foods to round out the dish. This works well with strawberries and with peanut butter.Recommended, if you set your expectations to match the reality that this is not really chocolate.

I'm not a huge fan of fruit. I am a huge fan of chocolate.  I am always dieting and having this stuff to dip berries, especially strawberries, is just what the doctor ordered.  It does impart just the right amount of chocolatey-ness to make you think you're eating chocolate-covered fruit.  I've tried it with very favorable results with strawberries and even orange segments.Many of Walden Farms' products are not to my liking, but this one is well worth the money.  I think Ms Bad Review, below, probably tried to eat the sauce like either straight (which wouldn't be awful, just underwhelming) or I don't know what.  I can't imagine anyone finding this stuff to be BAD.  At worst, it's just, "eh."
Having tried the three top brands on Amazon for "coffee candy" (these, United, and Bali's Best), I found Kopiko the least satisfying of the three, which isn't to say they weren't enjoyable. The one snag I kept hitting with these is every time I popped one in my mouth I got an unsatisfactory smack of a taste that just didn't resonate with candy at ALL. Having looked at the ingredients, I think it's the vegetable oil. Once I get passed that initial bewilderment of trying to decide exactly what it is I'm eating, a subdued coffee and cream flavor comes through. That's all good and well, except if what I want is coffee candy, then I expect coffee candy! Don't give me a latte or cappuccino when all I asked for was coffee.
I've tried many brands, and as a former coffee shop owner, I am 100% in favor or these over all the others I have had.  No corn syrup like the others either.  Good balance of sweet to coffee taste in a rectangular candy. THe 4.2 oz size seems to be over priced since I see these at Lotte and other markets around $2.50 for that size and saw an 8+ oz size for the same price from another seller...that's a better deal.  These, unlike many, don't break up in your mouth either...smooth all they way...no sharp edges as they dissolve away.  Yum...try the cappuccino version too...absolutely wonderful candies.
Yes, we're very pleased with the flavor and size of these mushrooms, but even  more amazing is the cost!  16 oz. of Shitake mushroom caps costs 7 times this at our favorite grocery....yes, seven times!True the mushroom caps in our local grocery had  all the stems removed and there are some stems in  this package, but gracious!  For the difference in price I'll gladly remove stems if we  don't want them there.  (And hum happily while doing it)Further the order arrived in only 3 days without expedited shipping, and it was extremely well packaged so there was absolutely no crushing of the product.You can bet we'll be buying our Shitakes here from now on!- Gail Cooke
Based on the many bags of dried Shiitake Mushrooms that I've enjoyed in the past, I made the obvious assumption that the 'shrooms bought from the Amazon website would also be of superior quality, much like the ones I've always purchased from the local Asian markets in my own neighborhood.  I just received my 1st order of dried Shiitake Mushrooms this afternoon, and was very disappointed to find that the contents were very dusty, with many broken mushroom caps and pieces, instead of whole caps.  The box that they were packaged in had been damaged, as well. While I'm not completely ready to place blame entirely on the purveyors of said 'shrooms, I do expect them to make it right or refund my money.  The mushrooms themselves, however, do taste fine and that is the most important aspect of this review.  'Nuff said....
Need to rinse off and I also add boiling water for  1-2 mins, drain, then add more to reconstitute. With almost every commercially dried food some sort of preservatives are added. The initial rinse & quick soak removes all traces ( I think) .Flavor is great. Color, large pieces, not much crumbled.  Price for the quality is very cheap IMO. Fabulous staple, great for cream of mushroom soup. ( btw, using Greek yogurt with low/no fat milk is a fabulous & tasty substitute for cream)Will be ordering these as I need.
These are wonderful Porcini.  Usually, I do not require uniformity of size in the applications to which I put them so no sense paying more for uniform size. The porcini I had been using I learned were imported from China.  These are imported from Italy.  Admittedly, since all my genes came from Italy at the beginning of the 20th century, I may be biased.  After rinsing these mushroom, I use the soaking water as stock in whatever I am making.  The flavor is wonderful and it is easy. I store them in glass canning jars in my pantry and they seem to be holding up nicely.  It I got in a fussier mood, I'd pop the jars in the freezer.
Every time I make some store bought spaghetti my husband is looking for mushrooms to spice up that plain sauce.  I hated opening up a can because we would not eat that many.  My mom use to have dried mushrooms and would use them in soups or whatever so I thought I'd give these a try.  First, they came very quickly.  Second, I didn't realize what a huge bag this actually is.  Even with the bag closed, they smell so, so good.  I have not used them yet, just got them today but cannot wait to try them out.  Their website shows you can store these for a year in a cool place like the refrigerator so I know they'll keep for awhile.  Thanks for the quick shipment.  I hope to be trying these in other dishes also.  Three stars only because I wasn't happy with this seller's customer service department on not acknowledging an email on a different order.
Truffle Oil is a flavoring agent. And this inexpensive flavoring product is pretty decent when added to cooking requiring a fungal aromatic.I suppose there could be a real truffle or two or ten added per 100 gallons of olive oil, along with a generous supply of 2,4-DTP for flavor enhancement. Who knows, and really who cares given its price and use? People certainly buy vanillin instead of vanilla for baking, and that totally artificial ingredient works pretty well in cakes. And people also use other artificial flavorings from pineapple to cherry to almond in their cooking. For those dumping on the product on the chance that its been enhanced, were you expecting 24K gold for the price of Grade 2 straw?
The blend is beautiful, flavorful and gives of an incredibly fresh and strong pepper scent when ground. The difference between these corns and those bought in a typical supermarket was evident. I was pleased there were almost no broken corns or husk flakes in the bag.  The packaging needs to be rethought, though.  The peppercorns come in a sealed cellophane bag that isn't really user friendly.  Something self sealing would be preferable.  If you try and tear off a corner on this bag, the cellophane doesn't want to stop tearing when you do.  Scissors are the best way to open and you'll need to find an airtight container to store the rest after filling the grinder.  I'll certainly be purchasing these again.
This gum does contain "d-sorbitol", even though the ingredients on the amazon page does not list it. I wish it didnt, but oh well. The gum has really great flavor and is great to blow bubbles with. However, the flavor is quite short lived. My favorite is the melon, which tastes just like honeydew.The actual ingredient list says: Sugar, Gum Base, Glucose, Corn Syrup, Acids [CITRIC, MALIC, L-TARTARIC), GUM ARABIC, ARTIFICIAL FLAVOR [STRAWBERRY, ORANGE, GRAPE, MELON, GREEN APPLE, PEACH), D-SORBITOL, FRUITS JUICE (ORANGE, STRAWBERRY, GRAPE, MELON, APPLE, PEACH,) COLOR ADDED (GRAPE SKIN EXTRACT, ANNATTO EXTRACT, FC&C; YELLOW NO.#6), CORN STARCH, CARNAUBA WAXCALORIES: 15 (17 CALORIES FOR ORANGE, GRAPE, MELON, STRAWBERRY), CARBS: 4G, SUGAR 3G, FIBER: >1G
This is one of my favorite candy items, and one I think is well purchased by anyone with a sweet tooth, any gum lover, or any one looking for a taste of the orient. Three of the flavors in the package: Peach, Mixed Fruit, and Green Apple are in a `brick' form. They are about 1 in X  in and are very soft and easy to chew. The remaining four flavors: Orange, Strawberry, Grape, and Melon all come in small boxes that contain four gumballs each.Each flavor is powerful without being overpowering. They have a smooth, almost creamy texture when chewed, and blow nice big bubbles. Also, they're not overly sweet, or grainy with sugar. My teeth are often sensitive if gum is too sugary, yet these offer no obstacles, only mouth appeal.I highly recommend this gum!
I bought these and the greatest thing besides the awesome price and the fabulous beans is that the VP or CEO or some such lovely gentleman actually emailed me and thanked me for my purchase and when I responded, followed up again with a nice response! How nice is that in this day and age!I used these beans in my home made eggnog this year and it was out of this world. I first scraped the bean and then threw the pod in and left it there till the nog was gone. (not long)I also use one when I make my hot chocolate "syrup" (Lots of bittersweet chips, melted in milk and a little haff and half and the bean scraped and the pod - once again left in - I mske hot chocolate out of it by adding more milk to taste and a little bitty bit of brandy...decadent...oh my yes!)This is a great buy, great beans, great company! Buy with assurance!
Item was packaged well, and seems to be of good quality, based on my limited knowledge of vanilla beans.  Though I love pure vanilla extract, I'm new to using the whole bean.  I withheld one star just because the flavor, when using the entire bean (skin included), had a subtle "grassy" taste.  This may be normal, or due to my inexperience and/or improper preparation of the bean, but I thought I correctly followed the directions I had read elsewhere.  Regardless, I'm happy with this product.  They certainly smell incredible, and will make your storage area smell delightful.
MyCuisinart ICE-21ice cream maker had a recipe for fresh whole vanilla bean ice cream that I wanted to try--until I encountered the $15 price tag on a single bottled bean at the grocery store!  So I ordered 7 fresh beans from Amazon (specifically from JR Mushrooms, shipped by OliveNation) for less than half that price.Seven plump, flexible, aromatic vanilla beans soon arrived.  It was a treat just to open the package, because the beans smelled so good.  They came in a sealed but resealable plastic bag, which I put into a glass jar in my spice cupboard for long-term storage.The French Vanilla Bean ice cream turned out to be wonderful! And I have enough reasonably priced beans left for six more batches!
I've been buying vanilla beans at my local natural food store forever but decided that I need to find a cheaper source since I am using a full bean every week.  Two beans cost $10 at the natural food store.These Bourbon-Madagascar vanilla beans are fantastic.  They are plump and moist and very fragrant.  My only complaint is that they ship in a plastic bag--shipping is incredibly fast so the time in the plastic bag is minimal and I put them into a glass jar as soon as they arrive.  (My concern with the plastic bag is that the beans can lose their moisture much quicker if not stored correctly.)I will be buying more of these beans very soon.
To be honest I ordered this HUY FONG brand of SRIRACHA HOT CHILI SAUCE in the 17-oz. plastic bottle because, although an add-on, it pushed an order above the new $35 threshold to qualify for SuperSaver shipping.  It is good and hot, with a primarily chili-pepper taste, a good clean burn with the requisite side notes of garlic and vinegar, not overly complicated.  It works well in a VERY thin line down the middle of my favorite frozen burrito.  In fact, I prefer it to our previous brand, Crying Tiger, which is fairly powerful but a little on the sweet side.  If this is your first outing with sriracha in a squeeze bottle, keep in mind that it sure ain't ketchup, and a little dab will almost always do ya.  Although the plastic bottle is covered with languages in addition to English, the product is actually made in the good ol' USA.  Strong recommendation.
Holy crap guys.What did I get myself into?This stuff is delicious, and I am NOT a hot sauce lover. I can not tolerate a lot of heat AT ALL. I'm a huge wuss.I only bought it from Walmart a couple days ago after giving in and wanting to know what the praise was all about. Now I can't stop putting it on things.It started with adding it to ramen, then scrambled eggs, then squirting it all over my dinner. It's like an addiction now.I can't describe the taste, it's just so good. I love how you can control how much heat you want. When I first tried it I could only tolerate a couple drops in ramen and now I squirt it all over food. I built a tolerance that fast. It's like a drug.
I first ran across Sriracha (and am still uncertain how to pronounce it) while eating at a Vietnamese restaurant in California. It was given to me with a seafood entr&eacute;e and I found that I kept squeezing the bottle and tasting the sauce separately with my fork. Its flavor is absolutely amazing. Yes, the other reviewers are quite correct, it is not a conveyer of great heat, but its texture and flavor are incomparable. I brought it back with me to Illinois and have about 6 of them in a cabinet--just in case I ever run short. I've turned at least 5 people onto it and now use it with chicken, pizza, and even eggs on a daily basis. It is exquisite and I've very glad to have made its acquaintance.
I was afraid to try this stuff for a long time because Im not a lover of spicy food. Big mistake. This is a wonderful table condiment on a lot of things. I first tried it in Ramen now Im addicted, I can't eat Ramen without it now. Its not all that spicy when added as a table condiment, but is very flavorful. It has garlic, vinigar, salt and of course, Chili. Great on stir fries, rice and just about everything probably. Though Ive noticed if you cook with it, it gets spicier, almost too much, so be careful when cooking with it and go easy with it. Its much better as just a hot sauce you put on food at the table. I would recomend this to anyone who likes spicy food or hot sauce. Even if you're not a lover of spicy food a little isnt that spicy and it makes things taste really good.
Huy Fong "Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce" is offered in just about every Chinese and Vietnamese restaurant in my area, and with good reason! Unlike at lot of hot sauces, this has a great chili pepper and garlic flavor that compliments most of the dishes I like (particularly good on Pork Lo-Mein) and also provides a good amount of spicy heat. This is not the hottest of the hot sauces but it is on the boarder line for several of my friend.This is really good stuff and we almost always keep a bottle of it on hand to liven up or cooking or when take-out doesn't have enough "zing". It is also great to spread on chicken when grilling but watch the smoke when opening the grill lid, it is like OC spray if it gets into your eyes.Highly Recommended!CFH
This one is a common sauce that most people are acquainted with. For the price is a nice addition to the kitchen, for it can raise the level heat from 0 to 60 in seconds flat. The more I cook, the larger the quantity of sauces that I need to transform conventional dishes into more interesting renditions. This one must be used sparingly for those who shy away from hot sauces, but for the crowd that likes it hot it will surely deliver a punch. Been around for a long time, and deserves a 4 Stars for longevity and performance.
My work colleague has definitely gotten my number. He knows I like things hot. (He also likes to watch me sweat, but that's another story).  This was one of the Christmas presents he gave me.I have put this on just about everything, a ham and cheese melt, sausage, scrambled eggs, chicken, roasted peppers, mussels, clams, calamari, and most importantly in a Bloody Mary.It is also low maintenance. It comes in a plastic bottle and doesn't need refrigeration. The lid opens by rotation similar to a plastic ketchup bottle.It is not terribly hot at 1,500 to 2,000 Scoville Units, but it enough to wet my scalp. I'm definitely going to buy more of this. Why?Because it's hotsy totsy!
I'm a bit of spice hound and have flirted with other hot sauces before, but nothing has ever seized hold of me like Sriracha. An old Greenwich Village burger joint near where I worked at NYU used to serve it on the tables with popcorn and the combo was killer. The memory haunted me for years before I finally picked up a bottle. I shouldn't have waited. This stuff is amazingly addictive with a garlicky sweet hot yumminess that's hard to describe. It sits on my table in front of the salt and pepper and I've drained a bottle in a 3 month period. Incredible on eggs, superb on burritos, utterly transforms dull dietetic chicken vegitable dishes from the Chinese restaurant. I put a squirt in the health low-sodium soups instead of more salt and all of a sudden all the flavors perk up. Utterly highest recommendation.
thats saying a lot coming from someone with an ulcer lol...I cant eat any of my faves & actually a friend tipped me off about this wonder sauce, it does not leave me with a oily burpy heartburn after eating it. for those that LOVE HOT! this is NOT fire hot stuff in my honest opinion...its the flavor & that itty bitty touch of heat in the vapors as you breath depending how much you use of it...I love it on noodles,pizza,eggs... ect...great great stuff...my shopping cart has 6 more bottles in it to have on hand when hubby comes home off the road from his long haul driving job...im sure he will steal a couple bottles to store on his 18 wheeler!!
Southern born and never had any asian food until I joined the Army. Got married and my in-laws grew up on Japanese food. Needless to say within a short amount of time I was introduced to Siracha which I immediatley fell in love with. I was no means a virgin to hot sauce but this stuff rates up there with some of the best. It is now a staple in our house. We use it with egg rolls, gyozas, ramen mixed with soy sauce. Trust be you wont regret buying this stuff no matter where you are from.
This has become a fave in my house. I usually despise hot sauce and opt for cooking with hot chiles and spices. This is different. It has none of that strange flavor of Tabasco and it really is hot unlike Frank's Red Hot. You can truly taste the peppers. My hubby puts it on almost everything from tacos to eggs to empanadas and on and on. I just recently purchased the Sriracha cookbook and love it even more when used in cooking. Deviled eggs, spicy shrimp, and the best .wings ever made are thanks to this sauce. Delicious. And definitely cheaper in your local market. My supermarket doesn't carry it but I can find it at my fruit store and at the Asian grocery for less than half of what it is priced here for. If you cant find it elsewhere it is definitely worth the extra cost because it is that good and because one bottle will last a long time.
For quite some time, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food.  Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches.  Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce has set itself apart from the others as being a hot sauce that I do not consider to be a favorite.  Even though it is not terrible--I used two bottles of it--it is not something that I would use on a regular basis.  As for the sauce's flavor, it is distinctive yet peculiar.  It has a nice heat to it, also--not too mild and not too hot.  I have used it on multiple kinds of food.  I do not consider Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce to be a preference, but I do admit that it stands out from the other hot sauces that I have used.  Actually, I rate it 2.5 stars.
I love sriracha.  I remember getting hooked on it in the Teriyaki houses in Kirkland, WA many years ago.  I hadn't had it for some time but recently purchased a bottle for nostalgia's sake.  I find myself putting it on everything -- scrambled eggs, pizza, spaghetti, Chinese food -- even in my morning grits on days when I need an extra urgency in my stride. :-)  It's very good at imparting heat without that overpowering vinegar taste that other sauces impose.  I can't imagine I'll be without my bottle of Sriracha again anytime soon.
True story: I surfed online looking for difficult and expensive to find gourmet ingredients when I came across this listing.  Every review raved about the excellent service provided by JR Mushrooms.  I phoned them to ask a question about refrigeration vs shelf storage and got a voice-mail.  I left a message and five minutes later the man himself personally called and gave me friendly and professional answers to my questions.  I ordered these truffles and several other items.  The next morning there was a little personal e-mail from JR thanking me for the order and by noon the order had arrived, although I chose the cheapest shipping.  THIS is the best customer service I have ever experienced with on-line shopping.  Thanks!
I was very excited about this purchase until I tried this truffle.These were horrible.  Maybe I got the worst bottle they have ever sold and I just happened to get them.  But, these are bad.  If you want to eat the root of a dirty old root of a tree, you will enjoy these.  If you doubt my credibility of my review, please feel free to read my other reviews.  Please don't waste your money.  My wife tried these and couldn't even believe these could be called truffles.
Chocolate sauce, cool & easy:Thoroughly whisk 1 1/2 cups nonfat plain yogurt, 1/4 cup half & half, 1/3 cup Ghirardelli Natural Unsweetened Cocoa and 1 tbsp sugar. Cover and refrigerate at least 20 min., then whisk again before serving. Also try with 1/2 tsp organic orange oil.Serve with fresh apple slices, red grapes and walnuts to further enhance the nutritional benefits of the plain yogurt (protein, probiotics) and natural cocoa (antioxidants); include a slice of Teff 'n Stuff bread (recipe posted online) for gourmet presentation.After several years of recipe testing, this natural unsweetened cocoa powder remains my first choice of widely-available cocoa powders for chocolate-flavored recipes. The flavor is so rich and satisfying that selection was "no contest" for the Teff 'n Stuff Bread.Caution: Freeze this sauce overnight and you may be inspired to make your own frozen chocolate yogurt all the time! Add a teaspoon of coffee crystals to the mixture for mocha flavor.
Unfortunately I am gluten intolerant and these have wheat flour.  I read reviews before I purchased them and someone listed the ingredients but they didn't mention the wheat flour.  These are VERY mild in flavor, not much zing to them at all.  Pleasant to eat and I would have enjoyed eating them but could not .  My husband will eat the whole bag I am sure!  As for me, I am on a continued hunt to find Wasabi Peas I like that have NO WHEAT in them!
While I must say that the quality and spiciness of the peas are amazing (it has a nice horseradish-like spice, expected in eating wasabi), the packaging leaves little to be desired. Five pounds is a lot of weight to transport, and during shipment, it seems like my package went through a bit of a beating. While I was able to hash it out with Amazon's CS team, I wanted to inform Hoosier Hill Farm to tighten up the packaging, or the peas will burst out of the bag! The little tape-tie will not sustain 5 lbs of peas during transport.Even though this is the case, I wanted to note that the peas themselves are great. Please beef up the tie, or seal it better. It would change it from a 4-star product to a 5-star product.
Every once in a while my wife will pick up a box of English muffins and they are a good start to the day.  She happened to pick up some Bays English muffins and she included them in our morning breakfast.  She fried up a little bacon and an egg and grilled the muffins in a little butter on the hot plate.  She made a bacon-egg-muffin sandwich that was the best we have ever had.  The muffins were toasty and fresh and just wonderful.The muffins are also excellent when toasted and served with butter and honey or apple butter or jelly.  They are a great way to start the day and I love them.  They taste great and I recommend them to you.
Now if you just want a little fish stock, and don't want to go through the Kombu and Bonita flakes proper process, this is the way to go. I often want just a little fish stock and do not want to make two gallons for a cup or two.Steaming clams and don't drink alcohol, use this instead of white wine or chicken broth (not very sea like).I don't use the entire envelope when I need just a little. Just mix to taste, put a file folder clip on balance of package, and put in the fridge in a spot where you won't lose it.Just to be sure, use a permanent marker and write the open date on the outside so if you find it in 5 years you know you lost of forgot it.Jim in So Calif
Home made quick and easy Miso Shiro isn't the same without Ajinomoto Hon Dashi.  Unless of course you want to buy the freeze dried bonito tuna lfakes, or try making your own broth from the little dried fishes in a plastic baggie.Then at the other end of the scale there's the packet saved from the last time you cooked two Top Ramens and only used the one flavor pack.  But then we're here for the taste factor.  And besides I never got the hang of the little fishies you use to make the soup broth and toss away their rehydrated little carcass'.(I discovered If careful it was possible to tie them on a hook to use as bait fish in Yokohama Bay)Witness:  If you see Anjinnomoto on a Japanese Food label and it is going to be good. (if you follow the instructions)
Its hot stuff like horseradish is. Throw in some green coloring and VIOLA you have &#34;wasabi&#34;. It is obvious this is NOT Wasabi root, the original Japanese sushi and sashimi spice. Says so right on the pack. Worse is the great price at $1.99 until you notice the shipping at $5.25 making the total ACTUAL price $7.24. Pick it up at your local grocery store in the Asian section for $1.79. Wish Amazon would make vendors clarify BOTH cost UP FRONT instead of the old bait and switch. No sale.
I would like to start off by saying I'm no expert on food - especially sushi.  But I know I like sushi so much so that I learned to make it at home rather than go out to an expensive restaurant to get it.  So I bought some wasabi because you can't really have sushi without it in my opinion.Some reviewers don't like this because they claim it isn't real wasabi.  That may be true - I don't know quite honestly.  I just know that although the texture was a little creamier than what I got in a restaurant, it still did the trick.  It was very hot and I really liked it.  But use VERY sparingly.  I made the mistake of putting too much on, I thought it wouldn't pack a punch and wow was I wrong.This tube will last me quite awhile.  I have made three batches of sushi and I haven't hardly put a dent in the bottle yet.
Yes, this pepper condiment won't leave you crawling to bed from the bathroom. It's about adding a range of flavors to contrast whatever it is you're cooking, not committing seppuku by hot pepper. If you're idea of a good pepper sauce is one that leaves you vomiting flames from both ends, by all means please avoid Shichimi Togarashi. If you want an authentic flavor enhancer from Japan that compliments a meal, this should be on your table next to the soy sauce and that creepy Kewpie Brand Mayo.
House shichimi togarashi (7 flavored pepper spice) is a very popular brand of seasoning and this distinct little red glass jar is often found on countertops in ramen shops and izakayas across Japan and the US. It is an excellent spice to sprinkle on top of ramen, fish, grilled chicken skewers, okonomiyaki, and any other food you'd like to add a little fire to.Shichimi doesn't just bring heat. It adds texture, flavor, and a small amount of added nutrients from the seeds in the mixture. Shichimi in Japan usually contains hemp seed as one of the 7 ingredients, which gives the spice a good crunch. For export to the US, this ingredient has been replaced. Aside from that, this is a true taste of a Japanese favorite.Be sure to put the cap back on tightly after use so that no moisture gets into the bottle. When that happens, the powdered ingredients will start to stick together and become difficult to shake out of the hole.
This spice is very difficult to find and very expensive for what you get... but... you must get it!  A little goes a long ways.  It has a really unique flavor... kind of like celery and red pepper and garlic with a nice bite of heat that doesn't burn.  It is very good to sprinkle on Organic, Non-GMO Heirloom Popcorn popped the good old fashioned way and on Home Made potato chips... the uses for this spice are only limited to the chef's imagination.
Alright, I'll preface by saying that I have not had the pricing or expiration (not that I would notice) issues that some of the other reviewers have faced.  I prefer the 3-pack. I get them every 3 months and the price has always been between 6.50 and 8.50. This is a tremendous bargain. One of these boxes at Duane Reade costs $4.99+. I would probably get it delivered more than once every 3 months if I ate breakfast more.This is by far my favorite cereal, and while I may sound like a child, I'm 27. Since you're curious, the other members of the Cereal Rushmore are:Cinnamon Toast CrunchFrosted FlakesCorn PopsHonorable Mention: Lucky CharmsBoom, done.
Kraft Parmesan Cheese itself is a great product. We use a lot of parmesan cheese in our house and we go through a canister every few weeks or so. Over the three decades I've been using parmesan cheese I've tried other brands, and I keep coming back to Kraft. The store brands and other discount brands might save you as much as 50 per container, but they're not as good. Kraft parmesan cheese is finer and tastier and doesn't clump. And it contains no fillers. About the only way you can get better Parmesan cheese is to buy a brick and grate it yourself. However, for convenience Kraft can't be beat. That said, the price of $7.00, which is the current price listed (as of June 17, 2014) is far more expensive than you need to pay. I can generally get the 8-ounce container for $3.50 or less at our supermarket.
When I was very young I tried using this exceedingly dry cheese to make a sauce and I don't advise it.  As I recall, it never did blend in smoothly and the result was rather grainy.  Small grains but grainy lumps nonetheless. (Poor hubby- lol).But as something to keep in the pantry or fridge to throw on top of spaghetti, garlic toast, a salad, or into meatloaf at the last minute, it's great.Three and a half Stars.  Kraft Parmesan Cheese has it's place in the kitchen.  Not so much as a source of Alfredo sauce, but rather as a condiment.Reasonably priced.  Long shelf life means you have a fall back position if your block Parmesan has gone too moldy.  Unlike some brands there are no `fillers'.  Only two preservatives; one to preserve flavor, the other to prevent caking.
THIS IS MY HUSBANDS FAVORITE CEREAL. I TRIED EDUCATING HIM ON THE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT INFO ON GENETICALLY MODIFIED CORN (PLEASE READ THE 2ND REVIEW!) BUT HE'S A 53YR OLD GROWN MAN MAKING HIS OWN DECISION. I HAD 2 GIVE IT 5 STARS BECAUSE IT ARRIVED QUICKLY, THE PKGING IN PRISTINE CONDITION, THE CONTENTS R FRESH, IT HAS A FAR OFF DUE DATE  + COST ME NEARLY HALF WHAT I PAY IN THE SUPERMARKET. BV IF U HAVE MORE SENSE THAN MY HUSBAND, PLEASE DONT EAT THIS STUFF!
I've been eating Frosted Flakes for as long as I can remember. One of those simple treats that never gets old. Although, as age has not stood still for me, I tend to mix this with a more age-appropriate cereal such as bran flakes. A good-sized touch of Tony the Tiger makes the good-for-you cereal much easier to deal with.The box is huge, but inside there are two sealed bags of a more normal size that will fit in the cabinet. Very fresh, and if you catch it on a price dip, it's better priced than the warehouse clubs.Love those flakes!
This is one of my favorite Cereals "Frosted Flakes" I have been eating it for years and it always tastes good, Frosted Oven Toasted Corn Flakes, it's Fortified with 10 Vitamins and Minerals and it has only 120 Calories per serving. Frosted Flakes was the First Cereal introduced by the Kellogg's Company in the early 50's. Frosted Flakes doesn't taste Stale or overly Sweet, I eat it sometimes in the Morning and very often as a Snack, right out of the Box,...one of Life's Simple Pleasures. The 61.9-Ounce Box is like getting two Large Boxes inside a Huge one, I would have to Pay a lot more where I Shop to get the equivalent Amount of two Boxes for that Price, and I think that is...GR-R-REAT! (sorry, I had to do it)...Thank You
I'm a Coke guy, not a Pepsi guy.  Coke has the right amount of carbonation and is not too sweet.  It's is a very refreshing cola product.  In my opinion, you just can't beat plain old Coke.This 12-pack of 12 is very convenient.  If you are going to party it's easy to carry and it fits nicely in the refrigerator.  This is a flap that you tear opens that dispenses one can at a time so you don't have to fill up your refrigerator with upright soda cans.
Just a few anecdotes---in the 60s and in Germany, the only Coke product available was "mit limonada", lemon flavored Coke--I switched to the other cola for my Army tour and didn't die or lose my teeth.  Then as a college student in Iowa, Coke in cans was not sold there and one fellow student had his folks mail him two six packs every week,  he became a good friend to share pizza with.  I do miss the 12 and 16 ounce returnable bottles that are not generally available in the US except for the Mexican coke at a buck a bottle.
When it comes to chocolate syrup there are really only two choices: Fox's U-Bet and Hershey's. They both have merit; they're both good, but for an old fashioned, New York style egg cream, you must use U-Bet. Hershey's is just a bit too bitter. ( For those of you unfamiliar with this soda-fountain treat, it consists of chocolate syrup [2 parts,] whole milk [3 parts] and soda water [seltzer.] ) (It can also be made with vanilla syrup, but that's another variety.) Despite the name, there are no eggs in it. U-Bet has a great chocolate taste. Also, during the Jewish holiday of Passover, U-Bet is made without corn syrup (only cane sugar.)
The Second MilkingSqueezing and squeezing in the wide containerThe moo cow cannot hear the farmer;Machines fall apart, the suction cups cannot hold;Mere husbandry is loosed upon the cold,The milk-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhereThe creamery of innocence is mowed;The best lack all mastication, while the worstAre full of pregnant immensity.Surely some expulsion is at hand;Surely the second milking is at hand.The Second Milking! Hardly were those curds outWhen the vast image of Elsius MundiBubbles my sight: somewhere in the meadows of WisconsinA shape with a trademark body, and the head of a cow,A gaze proud and commercial as television,Is moving its slow cud, while all about itReel shadows of the indignant end-customer.The darkness drops again; but now I mooThat twenty hours of pasture sleepWere vexed to lowing by that swelling udder,And what rough beast, its hour come at last,Slouches towards Tuscany to be milked again?- Filling Butter Sates
My bottle of Tuscan Whole Milk descended in a godlike spot of light through the roof of my house; such dramatization in delivery was well worth the cost of shipping. As if that wasn't awe-inspiring enough, the bottle proceeded to unscrew its own cap, peel off its shimmering film lid and then poured its contents into a glass that inexplicably appeared in my hand which was clenched in gripping astonishment. Without further hesitation, I drank it down with great pleasure, having just consumed the best beverage known to man next to gorilla snot.
I saw this on sale at my local grocery store. I figured hey its Tuscan.. it must be quality. I was horribly wrong.  As soon as i opened it, my daughter started to act a little strange as she quoted passages from the bible that i've never heard before (considering we are not a religious family). I just ignored it and had a bowl of frosted flakes.  Two weeks later I find her bed ridden.. i figured she just wanted some 2%. i attempted to pour some on her to snap her out of it. it boiled off her skin.  Now she speaks in an old english tongue and i cannot understand her.  I am now writing a letter to Tuscan seeking damages in the form of coupons.
Well I have fallen udderly in love with this milk but alas have gone broke saving money on the purchase of my beloved milk from Tuscanny.Since I can no longer afford this milk I feel inclined to build a Special Operations Force to steal the beloved cow of Tuscanny. Now I know what your thinking. Any one in the past that has ventured into the sacred air space of the Tuscans has been slaughtered without question. What they did not know is that if you drink a full gallon of Tuscan milk precisely 5 minutes before entering into the Tuscan air space you pass through as a Tuscan.I am looking for those with the special qualifications and skills to pull of this covert action against the Tuscans's. If you have toppled outhouses by the full moons light, tipped cattle, and observed the blue lights you have what it takes. Please feel free to contact me.
What's not to love about this milk? My advice is to drink it as is during a full moon 'cuz you transform into a beautiful awesome cow, and you can jump over the full moon like in the picture. When this happens you will see a cat playing a fiddle, and a little dog laughing to see you jumping over said moon. But sadly, since you didn't use your milk with cereal your dish will run away with the spoon. Don't ask me why a dish and not a bowl... But if you are okay with your dish and spoon running away then this is the milk for you!!
After downloading the Tuscan Whole Milk to my new Kindle Fire, I can read ebooks, surf the web, play games, and get my vitamin D, all using the same device.I applaud Amazon for their innovation. Sure, digital milk may be more expensive than the stuff you get at the grocery store, but it is transferred to your Kindle in seconds via Wifi or 3G, and the convenience makes up for the higher cost. And for a full 128 ounces, it only takes up 50mb on your device. It also tastes great, though I recommend refrigerating your Kindle for half an hour prior to drinking. You can also heat up your Kindle in the microwave for warm milk, which can help you sleep. But be careful doing this! If you overheat your Kindle, it could burn your mouth.Also, once the current DOJ lawsuit breaks up the cow cartel currently engaged in dairy price fixing, I expect the cost of this milk to come down.
I'm here to tell everyone the truth about this so called 'tuscan' milk.It was my great grandfather, Pasquale Iandoli who originally perfected the recipe for a full bodied, incredibly satisfying milk beverage.  It was a great success in his home town of Apice Benevento Italy, and brought with it large quanties of money.  With that money, he was able to act as a supporter of Mussolini.  Well, I don't have to tell you that with the fall of facism, Pasquale had to leave Italy, and fast!  He only had one copy of the recipe with him and while traveling to America it was stolen by a shipmate.  This person subsequently popularized it in the states, and ignorantly claims it to be 'Tuscan' milk, when clearly it tastes distinctly of Napoli.
This is the whitest drink ever!  If you've never tried milk before, then you should try it, its awesome!  It can give you an instant moustache too!  You just pour it in a glass and drink it!  If you like a browner drink, you can add bosco!  If you spill it on the floor, your cats will immediately walk through it! I never put so many exclamation marks in a review, so you know its good!  I will buy milk again!
There is no denying the "Tuscalicious" flavor of Tuscan Whole Milk.  If I am in the mood for a glass of milk it has to be Tuscan.  However, I find that Tuscan Whole milk is best used for bathing in.  Tuscan's milk contains vitamins A, C, D and E, all of which help maintain healthy and young looking skin.  It also does a good job of keeping my skin pasty white.

s. chow...are you kidding me?  i was up all night watching old BET Uncut episodes on youtube and got cottonmouth.i poured myself an ice cold glass of tuscan whole milk, 1 gallon, 128 fl.oz. and resumed viewing."tip drill" came on and as i got exuberant, i spilled some of my tuscan whole milk, 1 gallon, 128 fl.oz. on my MAC!!!!well, s.chow wrote about how awful a combination these two made.my milk and mac made awesome mac and cheese upon contact.if i allow to ferment, it becomes a rich pate.i need more tuscan whole milk, 1 gallon, 128 fl.oz for my upcoming juneteenth dinner party, but i'm afraid amazon was just a tease like the video girls of yesteryear.when shall i expect to receive my "subscribe and save" shipment?it's been over 7 months now.
I do not mean the milk. It has been known for a long time.  However, I have discovered that adding a little milk to coffee produces an unexpected improvement.  This is not obvious.  While milk and coffee are both liquids, they have quite different properties.  Milk is light in color, usually cold, and is the product of animals.  Coffee is dark, hot, and is a plant product.  I am convinced that if the millions of coffee drinkers knew about milk, they would become eager consumers.  Venture capital anyone?
This is the milk for you if you grew up in Beverly Hills, are a member of United States Senate (House members please look elsewhere), or the heir to a fortune.  We the upper 1% demand to overpay for everything and love to just screw the US consumer who have to drink $4 milk.  We demand overpriced products that show how wealthy we really are compared to you people who drive a BMW 3 series, you pretenders are not welcome to partake in our milk. This milk will cause the lactose intolerant rich to have diarrhea only the wealthy can enjoy.  If you can afford this milk then you belong with us and can laugh at your friends servants who have to buy $20 milk at Dean and Deluca's.  Peasants!Welcome to the high life and Tuscan milk.  Our milk is fit for the upper crust, not the working class stiffs that work for us.
Because I could not stop for milk,It kindly came to me.I ordered it through Amazon,Whole milk; sweet Tuscany.The driver, though, he knew no haste,No Expediter, he!The wait: Four days, and weekend, too.It seemed eternity.My milk, it passed through NYCWhere traffic snarled in rings,Slow past the fields of grazing cowsWho nodded knowingly.Its expiration date passed, too;And though the truck was chill,Vile germs digested lactose sweetAnd had their gruesome fill.It paused before my house at last,(By USPS Ground)My gallon jug; 128 ounceThough oddly swollen `round.My joy is dashed! My hope denied!Alas, milk lacks the powerTo strive towards immortality:My Tuscan milk's gone sour.-S
From Italy's famed milk region, Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz is guaranteed to satisfy. The birthplace of the Italian Renaissance is also the birthplace of the world's most delectable beverage, Tuscan Whole Milk. Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo and Dante Alighieri were known to imbibe in Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz's sweeth frothy goodness.  Some say that Milk was the inspiration for the Mona Lisa.If you enjoy the magnificent inspiration derived from Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz, try Super Fresh Salmon , Fillet, 1.00-1.25 lbs Avg.  Or if you just want some of that sweet Tuscan goodness, with less fat, try Tuscan 2% Low Fat Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz.
OK, I admit I have a serious, anaphylactic milk allergy. But after reading the reviews here, I thought this product sounded so magically wonderful that I'd give it a try anyway.Big mistake!!!I'm out of the hospital now and back at my computer, so that part's good. And I did get a helicopter ride to a major medical center, even if I wasn't awake for it.Still, all things considered, this product was a lousy purchase. The FDA needs to put a stop to the money-grubbing corporate monsters who market this stuff. Save your money, and save your life!
Texas Pete is a mild sauce that goes with a lot of foods.  I love the stuff.  But then I'm a Louisiana native and I have yet to meet a pepper I don't like.  Texas Pete has nothing to do with Texas, as has been pointed out previously, so don't expect it to be spicy like the foods you tasted in San Antonio or along the border.  It sorta fits in the same category as the various Louisiana hot sauces although it is produced in North Carolina.  It's a vinegar-based sauce, not very hot but lightly spiced with tasty peppers.I admit to liking lots of different hot sauces.  I keep a wide variety in the fridge and use them often.  Texas Pete is one of the milder sauces that goes well when you want just a little spice for taste but don't want too much heat.  Unless you're a masochist who has to have blisters on your tongue, you may enjoy it's lighter taste.
When they had those salsa commercials where they made fun of those made in NYC, it reminded me of Texas Pete. It's not made in NYC, or Texas for that matter, but North Carolina. The shape of the bottle tells you that it wants to compete with Tabasco Sauce. But I find it falls short, offering a simple heat with little flavor. This brand you'll see in lower level establishments that want to offer a less expensive hot sauce option than Tabasco. For instance, the metro Atlanta hospitsl I worked at offered it in their cafeteria. It'd call it a hybrid Louisiana style hot sauce that lacks some flavor and has a little heat. It's definitely not like the Mexican hot sauce you get at Taco Bell, no overwhelming chili pepper taste. For me, it does in a pinch. My favorite is Frank's RedHot which has a more vinegar taste and I discovered during a trip to my Irish in-laws in NJ.
For well over a year, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food.  Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches.  Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Texas Pete Original Hot Sauce has set itself apart from the others.  I like having this hot sauce around as a basic staple.  It is not too mild and not too hot and has a satisfying flavor.  This is a hot sauce that I can use on different types of food.  It is a recommendable hot sauce.
I grabbed a handful of Texas Pete sauce packets at the Atlanta Airport while on a layover.  I laughed when I noticed where it was made, but tried it anyway.  It is not as vinegary as Tabasco, nor as spicy.  I've enjoyed it, slathered liberally, on burgers and sandwiches.It is not a sauce to clear your sinuses out, but it has a good flavor.  I enjoy all types of hot sauces, from mild to wild, and this is a good one.  Give it a try if you see it.
There are a great many products which are vastly superior to ye olde Tobasco, but I still make use of it for a couple of reasons. First, it's cheaper than most of the other stuff out there and you can get a huge bottle of it for a cheap price (like you can here). Second, it has a nice kick to it heat-wise so what it lacks in flavor is compensated by its punch. I use it for in chili, soup, beans, dips, and with other recipes where taste is secondary to bite. This classic still has a lot to offer.
Have you looked at the shelves in the local grocery store to see how many different &#34;hot sauses&#34; are available. Then in some specialty stores there are even more. I decided to try a couple of bottle other than Tabasco. That was a mistake. There is nothing like the real Tabasco Original Sause. I have poured those two bottles out and will be sticking to Tabasco. In the long run it cost just a fraction more than some of those really cheap bottles I purchased and the taste ---well there is no comparison.
For quite some time, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food.  Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches.  Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Tabasco Brand Garlic Pepper Sauce has set itself apart from the others.  It has a satisfying flavor--I especially like its saltiness and tanginess.  Also, it is neither too hot nor too mild.  This is a recommendable product.
I had purchased a few bottles of different Tabasco brand sauces at the supermarket and when I got home I noticed they were all expired or near expiration!!  This is a large supermarket in a busy area.  So I decided to see what Amazon had to offer and I was delighted to see that I could actually order from McIlhenny directly!  Click on the "New" link next to the number of other sellers.  You will find a seller called "Tabasco Brand Products".  I ordered a total of 5 different sauces.  When they arrived the oldest one was bottled a month prior!  They do taste better when they're this fresh.
I enjoyed these chopped walnuts very much. They are fresh and crunchy and are perfect for use in trail mix or as a topping for ice cream, yogurt, etc.I like the small eight oz. bag.  It's a very convenient size that doesn't leave me wondering how to keep a whole pound of nuts fresh if I have to open the bag just to use a few walnuts on my granola in the morning.However, for some uses (i.e. making chunky chocolate chip cookies), I have found that the shelled walnuts work much better for me than these chopped walnuts do.  The small pieces (chopped walnuts are really just walnut crumbs) seem to blend more into the background of baked goods than the big shelled walnut chunks do.For that reason, I prefer the Diamond shelled walnuts to their chopped walnuts.  However, both products are very good.
After receiving a gift of delicious blueberry preserves from a speciality store, I set out to find something similar in my local supermarket; in particular, I was looking for a product made from wild blueberries.  Bonne Maman's Wild Blueberry Perserves turned out to be exactly what I wanted!  It's a very sweet jam that includes whole wild blueberries (which are smaller than regular blueberries) in every spoonful.  The preserves are easily spreadable and are great on toast, but I've also found that they are wonderful for adding to plain yogurt or smoothies.  A delicious must-have for blueberry lovers!
I purchased this product at our local commissary at the request of the resident BBQ Master, who wanted to replace his usual brand of cumin in his carne asada marinade.  I am glad to report that it was an excellent addition to the recipe, as it added a depth and smokiness to the flavor of the meat that had us all complimenting his BBQ Mastery.  One wouldn't think that a single ingredient could change the flavor of a well-tested and loved recipe so drastically, but this one can and did, and we couldn't be happier!  It is pretty strong, though, so I'd advise others to start out with less and add more as you go, if you need to.We have since used it in various other Mexican and Spanish dishes, and would recommend the McCormick roasted cumin to everyone.
Purchasing my favorite Good Seasonings Italian Salad Dressing Mix was just getting to be too expensive, even at the lowest prices around here on Amazon.com.  Then I found the same spices needed in large quantities here at Amazon.com... on Subscribe & Save they are the best prices around.I found a good recipe which comes very, very close to the real thing.  I plan to make this copycat version of Italian salad dressing mix in 1/2 pint jars as a Christmas gift for friends and family this year.  So, I purchased Oregano, Parsley, Garlic Powder, Onion powder, Thyme, Basil, celery flakes, black pepper, salt, & sugar in large amounts so that I could make enough for gifts and have a stockpile of it for myself at home.For Vinaigrette, Two Tablespoons of the mix, 1/4 cup of your favorite vinegar, 2 Tbsp. Water, 2/3 C. of your favorite oil.You can use it as a rub with the addition of other spices for meat, poultry & fish.
This was an impulse buy for me. I was looking for a lavender herb blend, and while this has no lavender in it, my research concludes that herbs de provence should not contain lavender...lavender is often added as a touristy/American/snobby thing. I've used this in spaghetti sauce -- delicious. I've also used it with just olive oil, lemon and parmesan on pasta --excellent. It has added nice flavor to soup and stew as well. I think it's the savory that makes everything I put it on taste so good. One tip is a must when using any dried herb: be sure to rub it roughly between your palms to break out the freshness. It will now be a staple in my spice library.
Oh man how I hate how Amazon lumps these reviews together on one page.Arghhhhh!And I also hate paying $5 for one of these jars of spice or herbs, but there is onereason I keep coming back to McCormick's for this one product....because thequaltity is consistently better than any competing brand and its noticeable.Add this to chicken dishes, beef stews, roasts, soups, in almost anything you canthink of and the flavor shines. And as I'm writing this I see that I have maybe a 1/4teaspoon left and so I'm looking at a trip to Publix today for a resupply.BTW, I'm not hyping McCormick, although they are a recognized brand name. Butthis is the only one of their spice line I buy, I go generic for just about everything elsewhere I can save some cash, but this is worth splurging on.
I live in a family with 2 very small children and so the ultra spicy foods that I like are not on the menu here.  When we make soups, stews and chili, it is always made pretty mild so that little girls won't end up crying.  Unfortunately, I like my chili hot enough to give me a case of the hiccups, so I find life kind of dull when mealtime comes around.That's where dried Diced Jalapenos come in.  I love having a bottle of this on hand so that when dinner is served up, I can add some "ZIP" to my own plate without endangering young palettes.  Everybody is happy! The little ones are curious, but they aren't forced to eat food that they aren't ready for.I wouldn't be without my McCormick's Diced Jalapeno Peppers, but they are not always available at the store.  I was happy to find them here!
This is good cinnamon, but it's not amazing. Overall it has a nice, fresh, spicy cinnamon flavor. I use a lot of cinnamon, it's one of my favorite flavors. I usually throw it in oatmeal for a hearty breakfast. I was intrigued to try this "roasted" product from McCormick after seeing an add for it in a cooking magazine. My local grocery carried it for about the same price that Amazon is selling it for. I'm glad I tried it, because it is quite nice, but I don't think it is worth paying more for "roasted" as opposed to just regular cinnamon. I don't really notice much of a difference.
Hoping to try something different around the kitchen by adding some saffron to my beautiful dishes, I used what I got from McCormick in place of saffron to everyone's surprise. Well, I guess that was a big mistake since my dear associates who actually made it out the door without soiling their Givenchy and Armani clothing most likely ended up doing it in their fancy super cars on each other in their way to their luxury pads on the hills. Needless to say they probably won't be back for next week's Persian tongue delicacy that I am preparing for them with French dressing, "shoot"...Reviewing so many food items as a single item is misleading practice by Amazon, not mentioning it "Ruins Relationships". Next time I am getting my saffron directly from Pampore Kashmiri.
Tarragon has a cool aromatic scent when one opens the bottle. From the McCormick web site, I learned that tarragon means "little dragon."The McCormick web site (mccormick.com) gives a sense of what type of recipe tarragon might work in. Beyond that, it is a versatile herb, going with quite a few dishes. Among these: asparagus, broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, mushrooms, potatoes, tomatoes, chicken dishes, pork dishes, and seafood dishes. It also works well with egg dishes and in sauces. Again, versatile.So, this is a useful component of anyone's pantry. . . .
Healthy walnuts...the best nut for us per the folks who know all this stuff and from Amazon, their at a good price. I bought 6 bags of them since I use them in a lot for cooking...NO not just cookies.So here's a good healthy product from a well known producer and a good price from Amazon...How can you go wrong?A must buy. I even bought them on the &#34;subscribe and save&#34; program so I keep getting them.I think you should do the same...
Seriously, how can anyone NOT like walnuts?  These were superb: big pieces, just the perfect color, no rancid flavor (yes, I have unfortunately gotten another (rancid-tasting) brand...and they were GROSS) I trust the Diamond brand for consistently good products!  These little guys are good for you, as they contain healthy Omegas  --- and did you know that they have the shape of a brain --- and are GOOD for your brain?? How cool is that?  Just be sure you look at the calorie count, though: snarfing them is not recommended...hard as they are to resist!  I put my &#34;daily allowance&#34; in my oatmeal...or carry them in a baggie for a quick fix on the go! Another perk: no added sodium! Enjoy!
I have ordered these walnuts twice and been very happy with them. Both times, they have been fresher than the nuts that I usually buy at the grocery store, and cheaper too.The only drawback to this product is that I end up with six pounds at a time.  In order to deal with the large quantity and keep them fresh, I store them in the refrigerator.  The upside of this is that I have been snacking on them instead of on junk food, and that I have been adding them to all sorts of food, from my breakfast cereal to the cookies that I bake.  Since nuts are supposedly really healthy to eat, I guess that getting six pounds of them at a time is OK.
This item seems to have disappeared from stores in my area, but happily Amazon has it.  I use this as an addition to homemade tomato sauces of different types and find it adds just the right depth of flavor and texture.  I generally use tomatoes from my garden, fresh or frozen, as a base and paste from a tube to help thicken it.  The herbs and spices are up to me and while I enjoy adding various things depending on the purpose for the sauce, using a bit of this product in addition seems to ensure consistently good results.  I'd like it even better without the MSG, but since the portion size isn't huge, I can live with it.  I end up with sauces that guests and family rave about and can definitely tell the difference when I don't have any.  Maybe someday I'll figure out how to duplicate the flavor, but until then I'm keeping this product in my pantry.
This Spanish style Sofrito is a great shortcut to a wide variety of Spanish, Caribbean,and Mexican dishes.Sofrito is a basic tomato sauce that is made all over Spain. Tomatoes, onions, garlic, greenpeppers and olive oil are saut&eacute;ed in a frying pan, so that the acid in the tomatoes mellows andmixes with the flavors of the onion, pepper and garlic. It can be eaten with rice or eggs, but oftenit is used as an ingredient in other dishes, such as chicken and pork dishes or the filling forempanadas.This is a great shortcut and the flavors of the onions, coriander, and garlic blend nicely. Howeverthis former 5 star product gets dinged one star for soybean oil and other ingredients that werenot present in this Goya classic not long ago....I also see MSG in there now and many people aresensitive to that so mind the ingredients before you buy.
...MAKES FOR A HAPPY ITALIAN WIFE. I BOUGHT THIS GOYA RECAITO ALONG WITH SEVERAL OTHER GOYA PRODUCTS LIKE SOFRITO, TOMATO SAUCE, ALCAPARRADO MANZANILLA OLIVES, SAZON con CULANTRO Y ACHIOTE & CUBITOS en POLVO, JUST 2 NAME A FEW. I HAND OVER THE KITCHEN ONCE A WEEK & THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE GOYA PRODUCTS HE WONT DO WITHOUT. BEING ABLE TO BUY THEM HERE @AMAZON IN BULK SAVES ME MONEY & TICKLES HIM PINK. LIFE IS GOOD. AS WITH 99.99% OF EVERYTHING I PURCHASE THROUGH AMAZON, ALL THE ABOVE MENTIONED GOYA PRODUCTS ARRIVED LIGHTENING QUICK, IN PRISTINE CONDITION & WITH FAR IN THE FUTURE EXPIRATION DATES.
Don't be intimidated by all these exotic Goya products, the company is actuallythe oldest and most revered of all the commercial Spanish foods companies.This Recaito is a fantastic shortcut for some of the best homemade salsa you evertasted. Its also a great compliment to simple dishes like beans and rice, or inmarinades or to give a boost to any of your other veggie dishes. A mild cilantroflavor infused with garlic and onion in an olive oil base. You're likely to finda dozen uses for this magic stuff. For me, I'm off to the store to get some chipsand tomatoes for another batch of salsa.BTW, I've just discovered Arroz Con Pollo, a Spanish chicken and rice dish.....thisRecaito is the base for the recipe and I was blown away by how good it turned out.This will be a weekly staple in my house from now on!
I discovered Recaito while in Puerto Rico on vacation.  They use it in many Puerto Rican dishes.  We use it in every Kale dish we ever make, and there are many kale dishes that we make.  This stuff is awesome.  We also use it in stir fry, stews, soups... dishes that contain vegetables, dishes that contains ham, pork or chicken, dishes that contain beans/rice/peas.  It is just versatile.  it adds a bang-punch of wonderful flavors to any ordinary dish, even casseroles.  If you like cilantro, you will LOVE this.  We keep Recaito well stocked in our pantry and use it all of the time.  I highly recommend.
This stuff is so good! I don't eat sugar, and this PB is great because it has no sugar in it (unlike Jif, Peter Pan, etc.). It took me awhile to get used to the taste--at first I thought it was a little chalky, but now I love it and would NEVER go back to the cruddy stuff. The worst part about this stuff is that I tend to eat it straight out of the jar....:).Hints:-When you get first get it, store the jar upside-down for awhile. When you're ready to eat it, turn it over and all the oil will be on the bottom. It's much easier to stir it this way than when the oil is on top.-MAKE SURE you store it in the refrigerator after it is opened. Natural peanut butter, being natural, HAS to go in there otherwise it will go bad very quickly.Enjoy!
I stopped eating peanut butter for several years when all I could find had cottonseed oil in it.I am deathly allergic to cottonseed oil .It is put in peanut butter to keep it from separating .I kept reading labels & after about 3 years I found some from Bama .I ate that for several years .But it was discontinued .Oh no ,no peanut butter again .Shortly thereafter I found the Smuckers which I buy at WalMart Supercenter because it's cheaper .I saw the price here & freaked a bit .I buy 6 jars at a time ,some crunchy & some creamy & seem to eat most of it right out of the jar while watching TV .I Love the stuff . Smuckers sells a Lid with a stirrer in it for about $12 . A heavy table knife works just fine & flipping the jars helps too .The oil is also great for chapped lips .
Some of the popular brands of peanut butter have added salt, sugar and oil in them. Not this peanut butter. I sampled it for the first time this week and love it. It contains less than 1% of added salt. When you open it, there is some oil on the top which you just stir into the peanut butter. A nutritionist recommends keeping the peanut butter in the frig. I think it helps to preserve the nutrients.This is very easy to spread on to a muffin etc., and is a tasty treat. Will definitely buy more of this brand and want to try the chunky version of Smucker's natural peanut butter.
I dont have much to say that hasnt already been said - but i know when i go on here to buy food product, i like to read the reviews, and see how many stars the products get and WHY.I have tried many natural PB's, and this is now my peanut butter.  I am a vegetarian, so i like to have something like this for protein.  I also cannot eat whole nuts.  This peanut butter tastes GREAT.I do store it in the fridge, but i sit it out to get room temp before i make my sandwich or toast or whatever.  It quickly comes together and becomes spreadable again.Love this peanut butter!!
I have fond memories of drinking Red Rose Tea with my Mother, from the time I was a little girl. Of course, one of the reasons I especially enjoyed it was the free porcelin doll inside. Usually, it was either some type of animal or a circus performer. This was just an added bonus, to drinking it. We would usually serve it with a splash of milk and a plate of graham crackers. This tea has a wonderful, clean black tea flavor - like you are drinking straight from the plant. I can't explain it better than that. It just tastes so pure. I am no aficianado, but, I know good tea when I taste it, and ain't nothin' like the real thing baby. I am going to go drink a cuppa, now.....
I have had nothing but Red Rose growing up near the Canadian Border in the US. I have drank it for over 40 years and in my opinion nothing compares to it. I live in Indiana now and was able to get it at a local grocer much to my happiness but recently they quit selling it and I had to go home to Niagara Falls Ny to get it. I just noticed you sell it, (yea) and it should be much cheaper now getting it from you seeing gas prices are so high and the casino there cost me also dearly..lol so who cares what shipping cost right? Please continue to sell it. Thanks
I find this to be the perfect blend for morning or afternoon tea. It also makes the best iced tea you can have.I have drunk Red Rose for over thirty years and living in different places has made getting it quite difficult - thank goodness for friends who would ship it to us.Red Rose is a lovely blend of Black and Orange Pekoe teas. It is a smooth flavor which is refreshing and also soothing at the same time. It does not have the harshness or "bite" that so many teas have. It does not have added blends or flavors so what you get is a nice, straight-forward cup of tea.It makes a lovely spiced tea - put some Cloves, a stick of Cinnamon, and the rind of half an Orange in a pot with the correct number of tea bags for the pot. Steep for at least six minutes. Add honey to your cup and enjoy!
OK, I'm British and have been a big tea drinker for decades. We purchased several boxes of this tea since they had a promotion with nice Wade figurines. The figurines were nice, but the tea - insipid is the only word I can use to describe this.  I would put this on a par with the Liptons tea in a yellow box that is totally overhyped in the US, but nowhere near the usual standard British cuppa - PG Tips, Yorkshire Tea, Tetley Tea, Typhoo, and any major UK supermarket brand.I guess from the glowing reviews of many that if you are used to this then it's great but I cannot imagine many Brits finding this particularly palatable.We keep this is the cupboard as an emergency when we run out of other tea.
No matter where I am or what time of year it is, one whiff of poultry seasoning instantly transports meto Thanksgiving morning with my mom and Grandma. This herb-based blend is a classic this time ofyear, but you don't have to limit its use to Thanksgiving, or just to poultry.Though frequently used to season turkey, chicken, and stuffing, poultry seasoning may also be used toflavor meat or veggie burgers, pot pies, soups, and more. When we're short on time, we find that a dashof poultry seasoning is a great way to add a lot of flavor to marinades, rice dishes, and vegetable soups.I used this accidentally on some slow cooker pork chops one day and it turned out great!And BTW, poultry seasoning is vegetarian and vegan, its not made from poultry as some people think. LOL
This is good.  It's just cinnamon stick.  Not much to say, there.But, I've recently been delving into Indian food, since so many of the recipes can be made gluten-free; in that process, I became aware just how much I take McCormick's for granted; I don't even think about gluten-freeness in spices, because I usually just buy McCormick's, knowing they're gluten-free.Other spice manufacturers will hold your feet to the fire over price to find gluten-free spices.  The few things I had to buy from other manufacturers, to make Indian food, were incredibly expensive if they were gluten-free.So, a proposal:  McCormick's should have an Indian food spices line.  What do you think, guys?
The true "original" is the UK version, which contains malt vinegar and spirit vinegar. This product is the US version, which contains distilled white vinegar instead. I've compared both versions side by side and found that it's even possible to _smell_ the difference. As you may well imagine, the difference in taste is considerable.Please note that this issue is entirely separate from the matter of the high-fructose corn syrup mentioned in so many other reviews. The US version no longer contains HFCS, but it's still not the "original" -- and it's not as pungent and strongly flavored as the true UK original.Use the UK version (with the orange label) and accept no substitutes. Especially when they lie and claim to be "original."
We lived in Miami in the 80's and this was on the store shelves there but I could never get it when I traveled somewhere else. Now it is!Do not use plain old lime juice when a recipe calls for Key Lime, it is not the same. Nellie & Joe's is the best.Here's the best recipe ever for Key Lime Pie:2 egg yolks, beaten1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk1/2 cup key lime juicePour into a graham cracker crustThe recipe doesn't even call for baking it. The lime juice thickens the milk and eggs. But I do bake it for about 10-15 minutes at 350 just to be sure.Comment
This creamer is EXCELLENT!  Yeah, I know it's not as healty as real cream or half and half but i don't care.  It's absolutely DELICIOUS and I cut corners in so many other areas of my eating habits that I don't feel bad.I would buy this in a grocery or big box store though.  I've never paid more than $4.49 for it and I squabbled at that price.  I usually pay $3.99-$4.24; sometimes on sale for less than $3.  It's absolutely ridiculous, highway robbery that the vendors on this site have the nerve to charge $8+ with additional cost for shipping.  Don't they know their greed kills sales?  Outrageous.
I try to eliminate sugar from my diet in any way that I can and I keep this one on my pantry shelf!  This is a tasty chocolate addition to your coffee, but like others have said, expect a "hot chocolate" type of flavor, rather than a mocha.  This, when combined with a packet of stevia in my coffee, is perfect for me.  It is also one of the few powder creamers that I can use at its recommended serving size and feel satisfied.  This is a keeper!
You're probably familiar with this product, right? So all I can tell you is that it's just like what you buy wherever you shop, except that there are six factory packed containers, like when you buy water, shipped to you instead of your normal purchase.I'll also say that my local Target quit stocking their cheaper Market Pantry brand and so purchasing this way saves me money. If I run out, I don't have to drive to the store just for this and that also saves me money. I've found myself ordering many items like this lately so I make fewer trips to the store.So I'm shopping for many common household items and if the price is the same or less, I have it delivered and save the cost of driving and save buying bulk. Recommended.
Bought it for a guest.Tried it, even after reading the label.Horrible.I mean partially hydrogenated oils AND corn syrup? Generally people who purchase a Sugar Free item expect the item to be at least someone healthier than the alternative. Regardless of the reasoning behind sugar avoidance, this actually has corn syrup, which is sugar! Making the serving size small enough so that all of the &#34;negative nutritional information&#34; does not need to be registered on the label doesn't mean that the average person who  is consuming more than 2 teaspoons of this can multiply what is on the label and get anything in the ballpark as far as accurate on the nutritional information.It is just sad... and I hope my friend stops using this. Real cream and cocoa would be much much yummier and healthier!
commenting on coffee-mate is not at issue here.  it does not clump, dissolves instantly and makes your cafe taste good. what i like about and and buy for is the size.  we are a coffee family and this 56oz size last a month.  it is not used for hot cocoa or tea so i can't comment on that.  all up all size containers to eqal 56ozs and it comes to a heck of a lot of money at the supermarket.  this canister is the right size and price for me.  will keep coming back.
My coworker had the Vanilla Caramel Sugar-Free Coffee-mate and we went through the two bottles and needed more.  Like regular Coffee-mate, this is creamy in the coffee.  However, it adds a nice Vanilla Caramel flavor without the added sugar of other flavored creamers.  As with most sugar-free items, it makes up for the lake of sugar with extra fat calories.  At 30 calories per tablespoon, it is not for dieters.  However, I rarely use a tablespoon, a teaspoon is usually enough for the occasional flavor boost to my morning cup of java.
Be warned: although the FDA label claims "0g trans fat" the ingredients tell a different story, as "partially hydrogenated coconut or palm kernel" is the first ingredient listed. This is a poison that is now outlawed in New York restaurants, and if you are careful about what you eat you want to make sure you stay away from this.As it turns out, they can claim "0g trans fat" because the content is less than 1g per serving, but it's a technicality: the product contains a significant amount of trans fat.Obviously, you're not going to drop dead from using a teaspoon in your coffee once, but regular, prolonged use is detrimental to your health. You're better off staying away altogether anyway, and you may want to do what I did and contact Nestle consumer service to complain about their deceptive practices. This product can and should be made with healthier ingredients.
This is actually the best coffee-mate there is when you consider it has less tan one gram of fat, less than one gram of carbohydrates and &#34;0&#34; sugars in it.  Just check out the fat free and sugar free flavored coffee-mates and you'll be shocked to find they have twice the fat, carbohydrates and sugars then  just the regular old  coffee-mate, Lol.Besides I don't want flavors in my coffee to mask the coffee flavor,  I like the taste of deep robust coffee and this regular coffee mate gives me that creamy coffee flavor I like.
Any product with hydrogenated vegetable oils isn't worth buying.  The fact that they are pretending not do have any by using a low serving size and rounding down to get to "0" grams, makes this a scam.  Shame on you Nestle.Hydrogenated oils have been banned in NY for a reason - they are poison for the human body. See the Wikipedia article on trans fats for more information.  Here is a clip : "Because of these facts and concerns, the NAS has concluded there is no safe level of trans fat consumption. There is no adequate level, recommended daily amount or tolerable upper limit for trans fats. This is because any incremental increase in trans fat intake increases the risk of coronary heart disease.[2] "
I generally do not like powdered creamers but Coffee Mate has the best tasting creamer!! The Vanilla is awesome but the Vanilla Caramel is my absolute favorite!!! It has a wonderful smooth taste and the best thing is that it is Sugar-free!!! Thank you Coffee Mate! I drink a lot of tea and I use it in my teas all the time. It offers a sweet taste to my tea where I do not have to use a lot of sweetener. I will be purchasing more!!!
56 oz of coffee creamer is a lot and I pour smaller amounts in a small creamer container to avoid spilling. This is really the best creamer I have used. I don't care for the various flavors and prefer the plain or original creamer. At this time of reviewing it has other creamers online, by half the price.If you are like me and like a lot of plain cream, IE...Half & Half, etc... then you will love Nestle Coffee Mate because it is rich and smooth. It is the BEST.
I purchased this 'bargain' size but it resists being mixed into a hot cup of anything, resembling curdled milk or cream. Since there's so much and it actually does not have the same rich mouth taste which is why I bought it to use with milk as a cheaper version of half and half....now I'm thinking as I write this that maybe if I pre-mix this with boiled water and store it in the fridge like 'cream' that the curdled issue will not be an issue.But otherwise, sometimes it pays to spend a bit more for something known and just enjoy it
I gave up my membership to a warehouse store last year, as I didn't use it enough.  One thing I did use it for, however, was for these large cans of Coffee-Mate creamer.  I can't find them anyplace else and they were a decent bargain at the warehouse store.Amazon offers a competitive price on this product, with delivery through prime membership.Coffee-Mate creamer is rich and creamy.  It dissolves easier than cheaper brands.  I like the powder form, as the liquid makes the coffee too cool.  So I am happy with this product and this purchase!
I've always loved hazelnut creamer in my coffee, and when I was diagnosed with diabetes, I really tried to drink my morning Joe, without cream or sugar.  HAD to add an artificial sweetner, but still tried to do without a creamer - but I couldn't do it.  SO happy I found this sugar-free product on Amazon.com, and that I'm able to buy a quantity of 6 at a good price.  Per container cost in the grocery stores is about $1.00 more!  Thanks Coffee Mate and thanks Amazon!
My wife is in graduate school and my youngest daughter is in medical school, so we go through a lot of coffee.  Both of them like it strong but I prefer a milder taste.  I've tried real cream, milk, flavored creamers and store-branded creamers, but nothing works like this for me.Having a bit of a problem with dairy products and not needing the extra calories of cream or milk, Coffee-mate allows me to smooth out the bitterness that I find unacceptable.  Plus I can take some with me wherever I go without worrying about keeping it cold.  This particular size was really cost-effective.
I'm not sure what to make of Molasses since I'm not a Molasses drinker.  I bought a bottle of this, because it's cheaper than Maple syrup.  At first try, I found it odd, thick and dark, like some burnt-up honey.  I have only eaten it with wheat buns and it isn't bad but, nor is it particularly good either, also, I soaked a glazed doughnut in it and felt awful afterwards.  Go easy on it, since it'll wreak havoc on your egestion process.Up next I want to try it on Vanilla ice cream and pancakes.I won't be buying Molasses again since I got sick by trying it.  It just isn't for me, the product is fine though.
special note:  This is a review of the product, not the offered price.I don't use a lot of molasses in my cooking but when I bake ginger snaps I love that the recipe I have calls for 1/4cup of molasses.  Why?  Because molasses have a lot of iron.  4% of the daily requirement per 1 tablespoon of Grandma's.  Not a fantastic amount per cookie, but every little bit helps with toddlers and growing big kids.That said, you can imagine my surprise when my husband brought home another brand -Golding Farms- where the iron percentage is double (2X!) Grandma's.Something to consider.Pam Teemom/foodieps--this is the 2nd best molasses advice I ever got --first is don't use sulpured:  Use a spray oil on measuring cups.  That way the molasses just slips out and you get all the goodness.
I use Molasses for making pumpernickel bread, so wanted to find a natural molasses to use in the bread. I was pleased to see that Grandma's original molasses has no preservatives or additives, the Ingredients label reads simply "Unsulphured Molasses". So, the product passes my first test of no ingredients that I can not pronounce. Now for the second test . . . I opened the jar and was pleased to immediately detect a deep rich aroma. Then I tasted it, and it was delicious. Deep rich flavor, and the product is very thick as you would want.Healthy, flavorful, thick and rich . . . what more could you ask for? Five Stars!
I'll likely try to buy this local next time, because it is pricey, but the cost is worth it.  I used to think all molasses was the same, but, like honey or peanut butter, there is a difference.  this has the best taste.  I use it for my shake (handful of almonds, an apple or banana, flaxseed, tablespoon of molasses and some whey protein powder and a little soy milk) for an after-workout snack, but plan to try it in cooked dishes as well.
Searching Internet videos We now know cancer Is mostly caused by parasites as fungus and viruses also We found out Baking Soda helps cure cancer that Is Baking Soda mixed with Molasses, I do Not have cancer that I know of but thought I might be good for getting rid of stomach fungus & pathogens I drink too much Listerine for this problem and wanted something safer, Of course want to use all Natural Ingredients with means Baking Soda without aluminum (aluminum Is poison) as Bob's Red Mill Baking Soda but when I seen the name Grandma's I thought It must be made by some big evil corporation that had some left over chemicals and thought If they dump a bunch of sugar In It then know one would know the difference so I ordered a different brand from Amazon but I seen Grandma's In WalMart and decided to use It until I got the other brand but It looks like Grandma's Is real natural  molasses.
This product has been around for decades and stood the test of time. I ate them as a kid, my children ate them growing up, and now my granddaughter asks for this when she wants a snack at my house. These taste great and are relatively healthy for a snack cracker. 5 crackers have only 80 calories, 1g saturated fat, 105 mg sodium, and 1g sugar.Shop for price. I buy 15 stay fresh packs totaling 56.5 oz (3 lb 8.5 oz) at my local Costco for 7.99
I have accidentally used the completely open spoon side rather than the sprinkle side now twice.  It's kind of annoying because lots of garlic pours out quickly.  I eventually taped that side down so I wouldn't have any more unhappy accidents.The product taste is fine for cooking (I mean, it's powdered garlic we're talking about here not fresh - there is going to be a difference in flavor for sure).The size is very large and you may want to consider pouring this into a smaller container if you're using it a lot or have a limited spice area.
I was quite nervous about trying this soda. Not only because of the flavor, (I'm one serious chocoholic) but also because of the price.I can report that I'm quite pleased with the soda and I will purchase more in the future.The best way I can think to describe the flavor here is a liquid Tootsie Roll with a touch of fizz. It's absolutely great for satisfying a sweet tooth, chocolate tooth or anything in between.  It goes without saying that this isn't the soda you'd want to wash down your meal with, but it's great for afterwards.And in case you were wondering, they make wonderful floats.
I have type 2 diabetes and love chocolate but it's very hard to find a  reasonably priced chocolate that I can eat without feeling like I'm slowly killing myself.Awhile back I remembered that Shasta brand used to make a chocolate soda when I was a kid that I really liked so I looked around and found this brand.I like the taste of this cold from the can but add a half a cup of no sugar added vanilla ice cream and it's really delicious! Better to me than a rootbeer float.It's beyond wonderful to be able to indulge and not have my blood glucose spike or feel like I have to slog through an extra half hour on the treadmill.So long as I can get my hands on this, I'm going to keep buying.
I just tried this today. It is not bad. It tasted a lot better once I started to get used to it. At first it tasted like the inside of a toosie pop than kind of like fudge. I just thought it would be more of a balance between the coco and nut. But all I can taste is the coco. It's just a little too sweet for plain bread. I'm going to mix it with some peanut butter for my sandwiches. I think it would be great on top of a brownie.
From time to time my wife brings home a jar of Nutella. I like it, but only on rare occasion. The flavor is just too overpowering for me and I tire of it quickly. My wife loves the stuff on bread (toast) or crackers and she eats it with her afternoon or evening tea. She raves about the chocolatey-nutty flavor and can't understand why I don't see things the same way. Such is life. In any case, if it pleases her, I'm happy with it. Oh, I might add that the baby seems to like it too. That's two out of three.Gary Peterson
This product is made in Canada. The ingredients listed on the label are: "Sugar, palm oil, hazelnuts, cocoa, skim milk, reduced minerals whey (milk), lecithin as emulsifier (soy), vanillin, an artificial flavor."The label also states: "Made with over 50 hazelnuts per jar. Contains no artificial colors. Contains no artificial preservatives. Do not refrigerate or microwave."It contains the same calories as peanut butter, 100 calories per tablespoon. It has 5.5 g. fat, 11 g carbs, and 1.5 g protein per tablespoon.Though this product tastes good, it is not a health food, and it is quite expensive. A 13 oz. jar sells for around $4.00 in a supermarket.In addition, if you are interested in buying sustainable products, palm oil is associated with the slashing and burning of pristine rainforest. Virtually all of the palm oil used in the world is produced in nonsustainable ways in Indonesia and Malaysia.
I am in love with this hazelnut spread made with skim milk and cocoa.  Grownups and kids both enjoy and it's a nice way to get picky eaters to consume whole grain breads.  Don't let the healthy breakfast commercials fool you, there is a ton of sugar in the recommended serving size.  My answer to that is that I don't indulge in the recommended serving size of two tablespoons.  You can get by with less and it's still a tasty way to start the day.  I am hooked on this stuff and my local market doesn't always have it in stock.  I went to two stores that didn't have it and resolved to buy it here on Amazon.  Big jar, twice the size of the tiny ones at my local stores.  It should last me a while but next time I'm ordering double jar package!
My son survives on this stuff. It's very chocolaty. I agree it is very sweet. I like the hint of hazelnut and I like it as a spread on crackers or toast. My son will eat it with peanut butter in a sandwich. It's good, especially for chocolate lovers._______________UPDATE: My son brought this to his childcare center and he was prevented from eating it because they are a peanut-free facility. When I told them it was hazelnut spread, they said it smelled like peanut and it was processed in a factory that may have processed peanuts and it's a nut. So, for those moms whose children go to schools where they are paranoid about nuts (not just peanuts but everything nuts and stuff processed at facilities which may have processed nuts), Nutella may not be acceptable.
It's amazing how many wonderful things can go on a simple piece of bread.  Peanut butter, hazlenut butter, almond butter...  Then don't forget the wonderful Marmite, a yeast extract.  Sigh...  But Marmite, Marmite is for eating toast while reading "Moby [...]", or perhaps "Barnaby Rudge". A bit hearty.  Nutella is for eating toast while reading "Remebrance Of Things Past" or "Dracula".  Rather luscious.  Like Marmite, Nutella goes a lot farther than the prescribed serving size.  Spread thinly.  Now, my children, go out and turn your whole wheat toast into a chocolate doughnut.  Marcel Proust would want you to.
This is a must for those who love chocolate and hazelnut. Hazelnuts are not nearly as popular in the USA as they are in Europe. When I visited my family in Europe, I really loved all the chocolate and hazelnut desserts there and was sad to discover it's hard to find such things in the USA. This spread is delicious but after you have eaten a real chocolate hazelnut torte (a cake-like, layered brownie type thing I had) nothing is quite the same. Either way, this is great on crepes, cake, waffles and as one other reviewer mentioned, graham crackers! Another interesting treat is to have it on fruit or make a peanut butter and chocolate sandwich.
I generally enjoy strong flavors but this spice mix ruined a seafood lasagna I made a few months ago. Perhaps it would be OK on chicken, but the lemon was overpowering and very unpleasant in the lasagna. For the first time in my 50 years of living I have thrown out a jar of spice as I cannot use it; the lemon is yucky and seems very artificial. Real lemon would not be anywhere near as intense. There are many much better spice mixes available, including other Mrs Dash products- but they are greatly overpriced.
What a perfect size for espresso! These cubes measure 2/3 an inch on each side, which makes them ideal for a two ounce espresso in a demitasse cup. The small size also works beautifully in a six ounce flute of moscato d'Asti.Each box contains one pound of cubes - 198 per box - and each cube is a scant 10 calories and 2 grams of carbs. This is an easy way to measure your calorie and carb intake with coffees and teas.If you tend to put too much sugar in those beverages, you can measure the nutritional impact of your normal usage, then scale back in precise increments. That is something you cannot easily do when measuring out by partial spoons.I'll confess that I preferLa Perruche White Sugar Cubeswhen I can afford them, but these are more than adequate and are a sweeter deal (if you will permit me the pun.)
I'm from California and have always loved this product.  Lately, I can't find it in my grocery stores and the price is WAY to high on Amazon.  I will have to find a substitute product.  Don't buy what looks like the same thing in 4 pound pouches.  It is not the same product.  The packaging makes it look the same, but it has milk solids and lots of chemicals I can't pronounce.Someone on this site suggested using pure 100% cocoa (the kind I use for baking - Nestle or Hershey) and mixing it with sugar.  It's the same ingredient on the Ghirardelli cans.  Voila!  The same great taste at a fraction of the cost.  I used granulated sugar - perfection.
We use liquid smoke for flavoring when cooking vegetable stews, some egg dishes, baked beans, veggie burgers and any other food we think may benefit from a little smoked hickory flavor.  We&#8217;ve used different brands as they became available in the supermarket, but we&#8217;ve pretty much centered on Colgin for everything.  The flavor is intense and it only takes a dash or two to put a subtle, hickory smoke taste in most dishes so don&#8217;t overdo it  -  experiment first with just a few drops.The only ingredients are water and hickory smoke so this should be acceptable to everyone &#8211; vegetarians, piscatarians, vegans, omnivores, and anybody else with any other kind of diet restrictions.
I used this to flavor vegan sausages and the first time, I used it according to directions - adding about an ounce to a big batch (about 3 lbs. after cooking).  Barely-noticeable smoke flavor.  Second time, I used twice as much which caused me to have to adjust the other liquid ingredients in the mix but I was going for that authentic smokehouse flavoring.  A bit better, but I'm going to have to move on and find something with a little more 'kick'.
I cook a batch of beans every week.  Often vegetarian, or just a touch of bacon or ham hock for flavor.  A spoonful of liquid smoke, and some molasses always guarantees a delicious dish.I roasted a supermarket chicken.  Not too much flavor in those.  I mixed together 1 teaspoon each of smoke, molasses (or brown sugar) and black bean sauce.  Rubbed the chicken, sprinkled with pepper. Yum.BBQ glaze.  In a small bowl, according to your personal taste, mix catsup, brown sugar, soy sauce, molasses, mustard a few drops of smoke, maybe some hot sauce.  Mix thoroughly. Brush on meat toward the end of grilling.Marinate meat in some soy sauce, brown sugar, and liquid smoke.  Dip onion halves in the marinade and grill.Mixed a few drops into some vegetable oil, brushed on potatoes and roasted them. yum.it's great stuff!
this is fantastic ......I think I will definitely order this product again in the future!  (I posted once about how I'm picky about what chocolate I eat & how hostess cupcakes & ding-dongs are maybe not the ideal thing to order through the mail, well after thinking about it I would now say this is much more of a 5 star product and not-so-much of a 2 star product .....the reason I was tempted to give it a two star rating is because I felt this was something I should be able to go out and buy at the market (or the convenience store across the street) ......anyhow I've now decided it's good in all cases)
Always the lunchbox stable, these chocolate cupcakes with their infamous white swirl down the middle are still one of my favorites.  No, they don't taste the same as they did in the 60s, but then again, WHAT does?  The cream is what I notice the most - not quite as creamy and lush as they used to be, but well, they're still great and taste great to the next generation.  They're also awesome frozen on a hot day.  They have to be considered an American staple - especially since Hallmark has turned them into a Christmas ornament!  Even though they do contain beef fat (weird, huh?), they're still good.  All cakes for the most part, unless you use applesauce, contain some sort of fat or oil to make them moist.  Just jump on the treadmill for a couple of minutes and well, there it goes!  Great product, been enjoying them for 40 years, highly recommend!
Delicious Hostess Chocolate Cupcakes were the first Hostess Cupcakes.  You can now get orange flavored Hostess Cupcakes as well.  While homemade cupcakes are still the best, if you have too little time to whip up a batch of cupcakes, when these cupcakes are fresh they are hard to beat.  They have a soft, chocolate cake body with a creamy middle and chocolate icing on top.  The only problem with these cupcakes is that they are addictive, and those of us who spend too little time on the treadmill need to watch home many of these things that we eat, both at one time and altogether.Well, I hear a Hostess Cupcake calling my name...
Crazy Uncle Jester's Louisiana Firestorm is the best pure Louisiana style hot sauce, but Crystal is my favorite of the original style, milder Louisiana style hot sauces that I can buy in a supermarket.  It's about twice as hot as the original Louisiana style hot sauce, which still is not all that hot but the extra cayennes add a lot of flavor and are the difference between being 99% vinegar (like tabasco) and hot sauce IMO.I buy this one mainly for my 8 year old son, who hasn't yet migrated up to the hotter Louisiana style sauces and he loves it. I'll use it myself from time to time as well, although I usually opt for something hotter.  It's still good tasting.
Crystal Hot Sauce is as basic to Louisiana Cajun cooking as Miracle Whip to church basement potlucks. It's not as salty as some hot sauces or as smokey as others, and it doesn't carry any aftertaste of powdered garlic. It's essentially a "table condiment", what you reach for when the gumbo is bland or the fried catfish muddy-tasting. It's the 'on the table' pick at Angeline's Restaurant in Berkeley, CA, the closest thing to authentic Cajun in the Bay Area. I used to carry a bottle of it in my instrument case whenever I flew to the UK or the Netherlands for gigs, but "them days is gone" in the age of airport security. Now I carry powdered Chipotle chilis, and hope some day a security guard will open the little bottle and take a good sniff ...
For well over a year, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food.  Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches.  Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Crystal Hot Sauce has set itself apart from the others.  This is a hot sauce that I like having around as a basic staple.  Neither is it too hot nor too mild, and it sports a gratifying flavor.  This is one of those kinds of hot sauce that I can use on various types of food.  It is a recommendable hot sauce.
Sponge cake with a creamy filling! These carefully scientifically designed treats stick to the original flavor as much as possible while increasing the shelf life considerably. The cream filling is actually shortening, because milk doesn't stay good on a warm shelf, the cake has all sorts of wonderful chemicals in it to keep it moist, fresh and light in texture. Corn syrup replaces sugar, soy lecithin is the most well known of the trace chemicals that help create that very smooth mouth feel- it's used in chocolate for the same reason.If there is ever an award offered to the scientists who find less expensive ways to chemically reproduce flavors, it should be a Golden Twinkie Award. You know they aren't healthy, but who can resist having one every so often? Even deep fat frying them when you're feeling completely decadent.Nothing tastes quite like a Twinkie. Best frozen and it's fun to dip frozen slices in chocolate and watch people try to figure out what they are eating.
I have been using Tiger sauce for about 15 years. I am fairly certain that I am the number one consumer of the product in the entire world. I use it mainly for making delicious sandwiches and rice. I love rice, with some flavor of course. Tiger Sauce is my secret ingredient for my world famous sandwiches. Basically the sauce is like hot sauce mixed with worcestershire sauce (another philyodaddy fave) mixed with steak sauce. It is kind of hot and kind of sweet. It is delicious and that is all you need to know.  STRONG Recommendation.The one question mark is that it is produced by the "Try Me" Brand. That always weirded me out, I am not sure why. Try a little harder, "Try me"Also, usually costs like $3 at the super market (assuming you can find this in the gems aisle), so don't you dare pay double that.
I first tried TIGER SAUCE during Lent. On Fridays, I only eat fish and I usually use tartar sauce with my fish. While I was at the grocery store picking up some pollock, I saw a 5 oz. bottle of TIGER SAUCE and decided to give it a try instead. I love this stuff! It's got an almost perfect blend between hot and sweet. It won't burn your mouth, but there is a bit of a kick. At the same time, there is a sweety flavor that lingers in one's mouth after the hot sauce kick is gone. It has the roar of a jungle cat, mixed with the purr of a kitten. I'm going to start using TIGER SAUCE on all sorts of other foods from now on. Use it as a marinade for grilled chicken or pour it into a pot of chili. It's all good. Try it and you shouldn't be disappointed.
Yum!  Use this for everything and well, you'll have wonderful pizzas, breads, pastas, etc.  Plus, it's the perfect one to use if you just like to use it with fresh herbs as a dipping sauce for breads.  Golly I love this stuff.  Like Emeril Lagasse says, "You could put this stuff on a car bumper and make it taste amazing!"  Been using it for 20+ years and amazon's price is awesome.  Another reviewer mentioned that olive oil is best stored in a tin and I agree.  However, I store mine in a dark pantry, in the back so it definitely helps maintain the health benefits over storing it in an open, lighted area. HIGHLY recommend!
Filippo Berio Extra Virgin Olive Oil is a high quality product made from the first cold pressing of olives from Italy, Spain, Greece, and Tunisia.  This product is imported from Italy.

If you have switched from cooking with butter to olive oil, this brand works great for that purpose. It has a light taste which is fine for cooking. I saute meats, onions, mushrooms, veggies and cook eggs and pancakes (whole grain, of course) in it.I also use it with a balsamic vinegar for a salad dressing with some seasoning - figure it's more healthy than most store bought dressings. It's great to toss vegetables in and roast them in the oven. I toss sweet potatoes in it and add cumin, sea salt and pepper. Delicious!If you're going to dip bread in it, you might want an olive oil with a heavier taste, but for the basics of cooking, roasting and salad dressings, have been very satisfied with this oil. 5 stars for a basic oil. If you're looking for something more gourmet, there may be better products out there for that purpose.
I suffer from diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome when I visit many countries in the world.  Usually I eat many exotic dishes that use animal parts or spices that disrupt the large intestine.When I am at home, I pick up a few old grain cereals, which are a good source of fiber.Spelt was an important grain in parts of Europe from the Bronze Age to medieval times.  It is an excellent source of vitamin B2, a very good source of manganse, and a good source of niacin, thiamin, and copper. This particular combination of nutrients provided by spelt may make it a particularly helpful food for persons with diarrhea, migraine headaches, atherosclerosis, or diabetes.It has a good natural taste free of anything artificial.  It may seem boring but I crunch it up alone or with milk.  It's really good.

The price as I write this review is amazing! I bought these at $3.49 and bought 5 of them. Even though they are not in a can my order had a lot of drinks in it and the tomatoes come in milk like carton. Most of mine were smashed down to the point they could not even stand.I do love that they do not have a metallic taste to them. I was not as impressed with them since I had a lot of tomatoes that were not ripe yet or had the top part on it. They are great to cook with but I found myself picking out a lot of bad pieces.Healthy and handy and for he price they are at right now, you might want to pick up a few!
Tasty tomatoes with no unnecessary additives or salt in BPA free packaging! Ordering this case on Amazon costs the same per ounce as buying organic canned tomatoes at my local grocer. BPA free tomatoes are more important to me than organic ones due to their acidity. These taste great and work beautifully in my recipes, but I wish they came in 15,5 oz containers to better fit my recipes. Their packaging says they have a shelf life of 10 days once opened and stored in the fridge so I can usually use them up, but since most of my recipes call for a can or about 2 cups I almost always have an open container in my fridge. I will absolutely reorder these again and again.
These are really great tomatoes. I hate the metalic taste canned tomatoes have and if they taste like the can chances are it has leached into the tomatoes, can't be healthy. These are very rich in flavor and not at all watery. Great as a sauce with just some virgin olive oil, fresh basil and garlic, s&p cook pasta firm and finish cooking in the sauce, simple and delicious! Love these tomatoes, wish I could find it locally but at least I can get it from amazon, what did we ever do without amazon?!
I'd been wanting to try this brand since it's BPA free, but it's been hard to find in town.  I recently purchased a few packages and used one in a vegetable soup the other night.  The tomatoes gave good color to the soup and greatly enhanced the flavor.  Last night I made chili from scratch, cooked the dried beans, the whole nine yards and added these tomatoes to the mix.  My chili turned out extra yummy.  I'm so glad I finally got to try the tomatoes.  I'm going to stock up so I don't run out.
This is standard against which I compare all other green teas. Now if you like your breakfast green tea strong, this is not for you. This is quite light on the "green" flavor. I like the strong green tea flavor also, but for breakfast this is fine!I have this straight, with honey, or with honey and lemon. It is a perfect match with lemon and honey. I never liked honey in green tea until I tried it with this! When I want my vitamin C, I squeeze an entire lemon into this brew! It takes a little more honey, but tastes wonderful.
Due to the recent 30% off special for select Lipton tea here on Amazon, I have been stocking up like crazy. The Lipton Green Tea Orange Passionfruit & Jasmine is in my opinion one of the better tasting flavors from Lipton's green tea lineup. The flavor is strong but not overpowering which is good because I don't want to feel like I'm drinking a fruit juice. I am a little disappointed in the actual green tea taste because there really isn't that much to begin with. However, to counter that, I do drink green tea for health benefits and not for its taste! This tea, like most of the Liptons I buy, I always drink cold. I do like to drink a hot cup or so whenever I can after a greasy meal but cold tea is much better in my opinion.Also, this tea is very similar to the pyramid bag shaped Mandarin Orange green tea from Lipton as well.
I love to drink green tea after my first cup of coffee, when I want something warm but without a lot of caffeine, in addition green tea is supposed to be good for you and increase your metabolism.  I don't know if that is proven, but it couldn't hurt, right?  I have not bought flavored lipton tea before, and was surprised that they had a whole line of green teas.  This one so far is my favorite one.  It has a delicate flavor from orange, passionfruit and jasmine.  Though I normally drink this with no sweetener with honey would be lovely.  I have also used it to make iced tea, but since it brews light, I would probably add in a couple of regular lipton bags to get a darker brew and a more balanced taste for ice tea.Overall, a really nice tea for everyday.  Relaxing and tastes as good as it smells!
There are better bagged green teas than this (try Yogi's many varieties or my favorite, Taylors of Harrogate Green Tea with Jasmine) but this isn't bad for what it is. The tea's a little weak and I usually have to use 2 bags to make a decent cup but it's okay for someone just dabbling into the world of green tea for the first time. It also makes a good iced tea by itself or with a little agave nectar. I'd recommend buying this if you're just starting out with green tea and you're not sure what you like.
I have this bad habit where I think I need three portions of sugar in my coffee every morning. By that I mean, no matter the size of the cube, packet, spoon, whatever, I end up putting three of them in my cup without thinking. You can imagine how disgustingly sweet that makes things sometimes, but I just do it without thinking. Ordering my sugar in packets like this just helps me keep the sugar added a little lower than I normally would, so they're perfect for my needs!
My wife and I never use real sugar in our cooking or with our drinks.  We keep these packets around for company that requests sugar in their drinks so we can make them happy.  It is nice to serve it to them in sanitary packets and they can sweeten their drinks to suit themselves and we don't have a lot of extra sugar around sitting open.It is also easy to take on picnics with the children who may want real sugar in their lemonade for example.It is easy to use, premeasured and sanitary in the packets.  Each packet is 3.5 grams with 15 calories and 4 grams of sugars which totals 4 carbohydrates.  They are handy to have around and I recommend them to you!
With so many amazing uses packed into this dirt cheap little box this is a must have.Put a box in your pantry one in your fridge one in your freezer and keep one separate for edible uses.Marked A&H; down a couple stars for the animal testing that A&H; does but back up a star due to being less than a dollar compared to the over $2 for baking soda from a non-animal testing company. Heck you can get the 64 oz size from A&H; for slightly more than Bob's Red Mill 16oz bag. But still... those poor bunnies.Get your box of Baking Soda and do a web search for lifehack baking soda and you can blow your mind without having to eat a spoonful of it and do a shot of vinegar.
I purchased this for my grandmother who enjoys a strong yet sweetened tea . Lipton' s Sweetened Ice Tea Lemon is her favorite. As it has the right old fashion tea taste she is looking for. After trying several store brands and Nestea which were either did not have a strong enough tea flavor, or too sweet for her.Guests we have served it to have also commented on how great it is also, enquiring on if we made it and how. They have been surprised it's a mix. However, they too now buy this mix. So I have already been recommending this product and will continue to do so.
Summer is coming and ice tea is my favorite summertime beverage.  Lipton has always been my favorite tea and Amazon had a special and I bought these.  What came quickly are two large containers of tea.  I prefer tea over soda in the summer.  Plus, when I am barbequing and getting everything ready, having the instant tea right on the counter, I can make my beverage quickly and still serve dinner at the same time.  Thanks for the quick shipment and good price on a good tasting beverage.
My wife usually gets Nestea brand iced tea mix from Costco, but last time she went, she totally forgot to get it for me and it would be another week or two before we would go to Costco again.  So I took the chance of ordering the Lipton brand, plus it came in a pack of 2 so that would last twice as long as just 1 container.  I only paid $10.76 plus I was able to use a coupon too.  In the end the price was better than getting the Nestea brand at Costco.  Taste-wise, I like it just fine!  I definitely love my ice tea and it saves me money with the powdered mix as opposed to pre made tea.
Aside from Manuka honey, Buckwheat honey is about the strongest honey you can find for treating illness. The darker the honey, the higher the antioxidants, and some source flowers impart even more health benefits. This stuff is strong. The flavor tastes very strongly of buckwheat. If you like buckwheat (and I do) you will like it, although it bears getting used to on some things you might be accustomed to flavoring with honey. For example, I like to put honey in my coffee, but the buckwheat flavor in my coffee is not something I am sure I am going to be able to get used to, even though I do like buckwheat. However it tastes wonderful on a slice of sourdough toast. Yum! And in a cup of hot cider tea it's got other strong flavors to compete with so it's not so noticeable as it was in my coffee. I highly recommend it, with the reservation that it's liable to work better with some foods and drinks than others.
First of all, let's get this out of the way right now.  A bag of Domino sugar does NOT cost 18 dollars in your local supermarket.  It's never been anywhere CLOSE to that outrageous price.  Why should it be much MUCH more online?  Come on!  As you can tell by looking at the seller prices under the used section (unless the prices change drastically in the future or by the time you read this review, and hey the way the world's going, those prices just *might* increase) it only costs a few dollars to purchase a bag of Domino sugar, if that.  Seriously, pick up a bag of Domino sugar at your local supermarket.  I also want to say that I -and perhaps millions of others- have distinct memories of the white and yellow design on the bag.  It's nothing fancy, in fact it's honestly really bland but... most of us have been using this type of sugar forever so our nostalgia's strong.
This review is for the product, not the shipping. Honestly, it is hard to tell the difference between store brand sugar and a name brand, unless, of course, you taste it! Yes Virginia, there is a difference. Domino's is the only sugar I buy (unless I'm desperate and there's none on the shelves). It is stored properly so there's no clumping, and just tastes better than store brands. I've used it for YEARS and particularly with the brown sugar. Put their's up to a store brand - WAY too much of a difference in taste. Great product, it is cheaper in the stores but hey, think about it. How cheap is it to ship something like this? You're paying for shipping costs built in, not the product itself. Highly recommend!
This is a good brand of sugar. But my problem was with the packaging and shipping. I ordered two bags of this sugar and a few other things. When I received the box, I opened it and first thing I saw was one entire bag of sugar opened and spilled all over the entire box. I like this sugar more than any other but will not be wasting my money with this seller any more. The cost of this bag is also outrageous compared to being bought and any store. I paid almost $12 a bag and only received one usable bag. Not worth it. I can get this same exact bag at Wal-mart for $6 and some change or at Sam's club for $4 and change.I just contacted Amazon and they gave me a full refund. Thank you Amazon for taking care of your customers.
What can I say, it's awesome sugar. Sugar is good, sugar is best for everything. Just don't have too much because too much sugar can lead to health issues. Overall, I'm happy with this purchase except for the packaging. The sugar was opened and it came out all over inside the box. I lost about 30% of the sugar. However, I contacted customer support, and they issued me a full refund. I'm not removing any stars because this wasn't shipped directly from Amazon, so I can't put all the blame on them. All my other orders have been flawless.
We use a lot of soy sauce in our household, and so, if we buy the little bottles, we go through them awfully fast. That's why I like to get Kikkoman Soy Sauce in the largest quantity possible. It's cheaper per ounce that way, and the bottle lasts a lot longer. Soy sauce is great on just about any Chinese (or other) stir fry. Use it in cooking the stir fry and add more to taste while eating. I also like it as a flavoring for rice, which by itself can be pretty bland. It's also a great ingredient when making a marinade for meat, particularly for beef. So, there's lots of uses. Most brands of soy sauce are pretty good, but Kikkoman is my favorite. Its taste is a bit stronger than most.
I checked with Walmart and it's the same price, so I might as well have it delivered for FREE!  I don't know anyone who's mother didn't bake with Bisquick.  It's just like a hand down recipe.  I purchased the Progressive Flour keeper to put it in since it's such a large box and I don't want it to go bad.  The flour keeper is 80oz, so I'll just put some in another small progressive container or a zip lock bag.  Either way that small part will be used first.  I will cut out all the recipes on the box and store them in my recipe box.
I was really happy to see this organic paprika offered as an option in Amazon's Add-on program.  I use paprika in many ways: spice rubs, stew and goulash, sloppy joe mix, sauces, or any dish that needs a boost.  For example, it's great to sprinkle on french fries (after frying, as paprika can burn, or before I've baked them), along with salt and black pepper.This particular product is a "sweet" (not spicy or smoked) paprika, so keep that in mind when reading or creating a new recipe.  Also, since it comes in a glass bottle, I recommend keeping it in either a pantry or, as my grandmother advised, the refrigerator; sometimes light can affect the flavor of spices.Recommended!
Again, Amazon has the product at a reasonable price.This was the first white pepper version I tried, and it remains my favorite.  It has a unique, sharp aroma, where I detect no black pepper notes.  It has a good heat level and adds interesting background notes; similar to adding a touch of ground allspice to soups.  It is detectable, but lacking black pepper notes, it causes people to question what elements they are discovering.It keeps very well during storage.  This 1.75 ounce container should easily last most users a year, since only small quantities are needed to enhance foods.  It is a fine grind, but not so fine it becomes easily airborne when dispensing.  However, expect the sharp notes to permeate the surrounding air.
We have tried everything to get even one bag to come out correctly.  Either it leaves LOTS of kernels in the bag and very little popcorn to eat OR it burns in big globs and at least 1/4 is burned.  We give up!  Our microwave is 1200 watts and we have tried the popcorn button AND numerous times tried other times AND we stand there and listen to it.  The kernels are still popping vigorously but it is burning inside.  Enough is enough.  What a shame because it is good tasting, what little we get from one  bag, but too frustrating.
I have eaten pop corn for many years and may even be addicted to it. I havenever tasted any as good as this Black Jewell Premium Microwave Popcorn. Ilike the fact that it is natural and contains no sugars. The taste is somethingyou can't imagine until you have tried it. I found no hulls in the popped cornand there is no oil taste like in every other brand I've ever tasted and thesmall amount of salt is just right. I just hope that it continues to be available at Amazon.com. I will be a regular buyer.Black Jewell Premium, Microwave Popcorn, Natural, 10.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)
This popcorn does pop up well with very few hulls.  However, it has little to no butter flavor and has a strange taste that I couldn't grow accustomed to.  I ate three boxes, trying to convince myself that the flavor would grow on me, before deciding that I was never going to get used to it and the calories weren't worth it.  I added butter, flavorings, parmesan cheese, but no luck. Too bad you can't return unused boxes!I ended up giving the rest of it away.  A very expensive taste test!
The hubby & and I have sworn off microwave popcorn for some time as, regardless of brand, it tends to leave an oily residue in the mouth and hulls stuck between the teeth, all followed by a night of indigestion depending on how much "stuff" that particular manufacturer adds to differentiate their brand.However, given the rave reviews we decided to try Black Jewell. It absolutely lives up to its reputation. It is flavorful, light and crunchy, with just the right amount of salt. - The hubby & I disagree on this point. He likes to add more salt.While there has been some variation, of the many bags we have popped, there truly have been few "old maids" as we used to call kernels that didn't pop, fewer hulls lodged in the dental work, and no cloying aftertaste.We're having a hard time keeping it on hand as we keep giving boxes away for others to try! :)
I am a bit surprised to be writing such a high recommendation for microwave popcorn. I did not have too much of an expectation.  The popcorn is very flavorful and not overly greasy, buttery or salty.  The kernels pop a very bright fluffy white.  I also noticed that the design and material of the bag is quite different and this probably played a part in preventing the burning that I had experienced in so many other brands of microwave popcorn.  I also did not get a large number of unpopped kernels.  There were some partially popped kernels - but those are my favorite b/c they are so crunchy.
I'm a big popcorn fan and have tried many brands. I tried this one because the best, BKH popcorn has gone out of business. I like the hullless kind and they not only had the best but the largest popped kernels. In addition to that on the average 99% popped. The Black Jewel had like 25% not popped and anymore then 2 min in the microwave made it burn. The popped kernels were very small, hardly nothing to eat. The flavor was good but certainly not worth ever buying again. If anyone knows the BKH brand and can suggest one like it let me know.
Yep, it's one of the truly great chipotle sauces around.  It's probably my favorite chipotle sauce although there are a few others that are in still in the running.  It really tastes nothing like the original Tabasco, another favorite hot sauce of mine.  I probably use the chipotle sauce more than the original Tabasco.  One of my favorite ways to use it is in spicing up ranch-style dressings for use in salads and dips.  It works wonders in barbeque sauce and to spice up bastes to use on the smoker.  Great smokey flavor.
Tabasco Chipotle is made from smoked jalape&ntilde;o peppers in vinegar and has a wonderful smoky flavor,a strong vinegar bite, and, of course, the capsaicin kick. It has become my go-to hot sauce. I muchprefer it to the original Tabasco which was, according to company records, first made in the 1860safter Edmund McIlhenny planted hot peppers on his family's property on Avery Island, LA.By 1868 McIlhenny started to market Tabasco Sauce. His process is still used today, and Avery Islandremains the headquarters for the worldwide company that is still owned and operated by direct descendantsof Edmund McIlhenny. Avery Island is about 2.5 hours west of New Orleans, and the charming spot is opento visitors. 1,500 - 2,500 Scoville Heat Units
For well over a year, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food.  Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches.  Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Tabasco Brand Chipotle Pepper Sauce has set itself apart from the others.  Tabasco Brand Chipotle Pepper Sauce is hotter than most hot sauces that I like, but I do not consider it to be an overpowering heat.  It is a good, nice-tasting hot sauce to have around, and I recommend it.
My favorite of all the flavors.  This is a very versatile sauce for me and I used on it a variety of different dishes.  The chipotle isn't too smokey or overpowering.  For those that like spicy, this is not very spicy so you may need to add something else with this.I had purchased a few bottles of different Tabasco brand sauces at the supermarket and when I got home I noticed they were all expired or near expiration!!  This is a large supermarket in a busy area.  So I decided to see what Amazon had to offer and I was delighted to see that I could actually order from McIlhenny directly!  Click on the &#34;New&#34; link next to the number of other sellers.  You will find a seller called &#34;Tabasco Brand Products&#34;.  I ordered a total of 5 different sauces.  When they arrived the oldest one was bottled a month prior!  They do taste better when they're this fresh.
I won't pretend to be an expert on olive oils;  but I will attest to being a family cook and consumer of olive oils and this one did not strike me as quite what I was expecting. The first whiff gives a hint of stale and when blind-taste-tested in my home kitchen by my husband, my ten year old and me- dipping crusty sourdough bread-straight-up, no herbs, no garlic no other flavors- 2 out of 3 of us selected the OTHER first-cold-pressed, Virgin Olive Oil from Italy;  we were trying to buy more American stuffs but will stick with our imported Italian olive oils for now. OK,  for me, this one is fine for sauteeing- just not the best fresh flavor for dipping or dressings. In case it it matters substantially-  the bottle indicates: 'Harvested  Fall '07 and Bottled 6-21-08'
I have to agree with the sizeable minority here that this olive oil is just too bitter (at least the Fall 08 bottling).  The flavor starts a bit grassy, but then a flat, mouth-puckering astringency takes over. At first I hoped that the bitterness would mellow with a little shelf time, but after year in a cool, dark place the flavor is the same.  I consider myself a foodie and I love strong flavors, but this oil's bitterness is just so strong that it overpowers any other qualities.  I have tried a variety of premium olive oils from the California, Europe, and Australia and have never experienced such an unbalanced olive oil.  Given the number of good reviews out there, I hope I just got a bad batch.
First of all, this item came well packaged in eco friendly packing peanuts. Run them in a bit of water and they disintegrate into nothing! I am into trying to be 'green' so I thought that was nice. It came on the day they said it would.As for the olive oil, I needed a high quality oil to get the proper fats into my family. I love a good oil but I am no expert in oils. I think this one tastes smooth and peppery, not heavy. I will use this oil for dishes where I don't need it heated, and I will use my cheaper stuff on the stove.UPDATE Jan 17, 2012 - Good stuff, esp on a salad with a good balsamic vinegar. I would give it 5 stars if my palate were more refined and had experienced more EVOO's out there.
had high expectations with the great reviews, but wondering if people are being sucked in by the old family run, traditional process hype, and a very high price- like it must be the best; i found it flat to the taste, slightly bitter in cooking something simple, and slightly soapy even with good pasta; good extra virgin should have a melt in your mouth aroma at first heating, a rich, complex taste; this just doesn't; buy a store bottle at the s'market and you would not know the difference cooking; this product doesn't measure up to a good imported italian extra virgin
Did you know that the Irish - *not* the English - are per capita the world's highest consumers of tea? No wonder, then, that there is a breakfast blend named for them; although Irish Breakfast is actually strong enough to be a great pick-me-up throughout the day. Traditionally, it consists primarily of teas from Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and the state of Assam in northeastern India. Irish Breakfast has an intricately full-bodied, malty, floral aroma and goes particularly well with milk (or cream, but real milk is preferable). Enjoy!
Irish blend from Twining has a pleasing crisp taste, just a bit spicy, fragrant and hearty, not so robust as a Kenya, but much more than a gentle Darjeeling. If you have tried Twining's English Breakfast blend, you should expect this Irish Breakfast blend to be stronger and more complex in flavor, but with similar brewing properties.You can buy Irish Breakfast blend either in teabags or as loose bulk tea. I strongly recommend the latter for greater flexibility, but the bags taste just as good -- no flavor that I can detect from the paper that Twining uses.Twining produces some excellent teas, none better than this fine blend. It has my strongest recommendation. It is also available as a decaffeinated tea, with very much the same delightful taste.
Twining has a distinguished line of fine teas. This Darjeeling is one of Twining's best. Darjeeling is a fragrant tea variety with a refreshing but not overpowering tea flavor. Twining's version has no off tastes or after tastes -- just good old fashioned Darjeeling. It brews well a cup at a time, but is also fine in a pot. It brews well over a fairly wide range of steeping times also.You can buy this tea either in bags or in bulk loose tea. I strongly recommend the latter, as loose tea gives you so much more flexibility in amount and strength of your brewing. However, I can attest that I find absolutely no off flavors from the bags. So if you are on the go, by all means, carry a few bags with you in a plastic bag or other sealed pouch.You can pay more for a good Darjeeling, but you will be hard pressed to find a better Darjeeling at a lower price than this Twining.
This is the fruitcake that I remember my parents bringing home for Christmas. Maybe it was a gift from a client, but it wasalways an easy thing to slice off a piece and serve it up on a plate with some milk for us kids, or coffee for my dad. It isthe Claxton boxed regular recipe fruitcake that my spouse wanted for his Thanksgiving. He doesn't eat many sweets, so Iwas very pleased to locate the regular one at Amazon.  Finding this fruitcake for him is right up there with discovering the old &#34;leg lamp&#34; (Darren McGavin loved it, you remember) is still available--although I must admit that lamp is not on MY wish list!!  But it is always great to revisit memories of Christmas past.Since this particular cake is now a memory, I plan to order another one--or two--for Christmas. It keeps as long as you need, even if you don't eat a slice every day!
Stevia was suggested to me by a friend as a healthy alternative to sugar in my coffee and tea. NuStevia by NuNaturals was the first stevia product I've tried and I'm hooked!"Why the 4 star rating?"While some complain it's either too sweet (it is more concentrated than sugar, so it takes less of it to do the same job...) or has a bitter aftertaste (I do notice some aftertaste, but not enough to be unpleasant and not bitter...), it is much easier on my stomach than artificial sweeteners like Splenda. One packet contains almost too much stevia for one regular sized (8 ounce) cup of coffee (at least for my tastes...) so use it sparingly until you find what's right for you.This is a consistently good, quality product. Don't hesitate to give NuNaturals NuStevia a try!
This is not pure stevia. Buying stevia for the benefits is not what this product does. MALTODEXTRIN is the number one main ingredient and, by the way, stevia was added to it. I have been using pure stevia products for 20+ years and always read my ingredients. I wish companies would stop fooling people into believing they now have the miracle sweetener. Its just like making donuts and adding a touch of stevia!revised review bc. I had mixed up 5 star rating of another stevia product WHICH IS PURE STEVIA (and accidentally gave it a one star rating)THIS DESERVES a zero rating bc. it a product with the main ingredients being SUGAR with stevia added to it
If you are looking for a sweetener that is delicious in tea, Stevia can be used to sweeten hot or cold tea. You can almost say goodbye to regular sugars in your drinks once you get a taste for the Stevia powder.Unlike artificial sweeteners, Stevia is never bitter and won't leave a nasty aftertaste in your mouth. The packets are easy to carry with you and you may even notice you have less cravings for sugary foods.By using a low calorie (0 Calories) sweetener with only 1 gram of carbs, you will be ahead of the game. Every single time you use one packet of Stevia, you are using less sugar and you won't even miss it.~The Rebecca Review
I don't like using artificial sweeteners because of the chemicals and because they don't taste good. I am a caregiver for my diabetic dad, and once I discovered this product I was hooked, except that it is hard to find where I live. When I found it at Amazon I put it on auto ship so I don't run out.  The price has gone up a lot since I first found it on Amazon, however, it still costs more in stores if and when I can find it there. I make limeade with this which I keep on hand at all times. In a gallon container of water I add 1 cup of lime juice and 2tbsp. of stevia powder. It is refreshing and almost no calories and no chemical aftertaste.  My dad uses the stevia in his coffee and his oatmeal. I haven't tried cooking with it although I know they make one designed for baking, which I'll possibly try this winter.
Something has changed drastically for the worse.  You need a lot more of this product to attain the same sweetness, plus now it is bitter.  All in my last couple of canisters.  Looks like from other reviews that the product has been changed.  Too bad!  Used to be a great product!----------------------------------------------------------OLD REVIEWHave tried a few stevia powders and liquids - this one seems to lack some of the bitterness that others left in my mouth.  The powder is convenient.  Price on amazon is cheaper than my local health food store which carries it for $23.99 and Wegman's which carries it for $19.99.  Despite liking this for cold drinks and sweetening yogurt and the such, I am still not a fan of this in warm drinks (coffee, tea, cocoa) and taste a bitterness there.  My husband doesn't have the same experience that I do with warm drinks and says it is just fine.
I keep buying this brand because it has no aftertaste, I use it everyday in coffee, tea, oatmeal....  I have a sweet tooth so I use it a lot. i really wanted the Pure Extract ($99.00 no fillers)  in this size but is out of stock everywhere I looked.  The pure extract would last me well over a year.  This version lasts me about 3 months.  As long as the price stays reasonable,  I'll continue to buy until I get my hands on the Pure Extract of this brand in this size.  I give 3 stars because I think fillers should mean cheap price.
I started using this stevia about a year ago and was really impressed.  I just finished my last bottle from the old formula and started this new one I had just ordered - YUK.  It has an aftertaste like aspartame (and I should know, I've used artificial sweeteners for 40 years).  The only thing I would recommend about this product is for Nunaturals to change back to their old formula.  I'm already looking for a new brand to try and won't wait until I finish this one which was a waste of good money.
I ordered this because Martha Stewart spoke so highly of it.  I am reviewing it, not from its mineral component, but from it's application to my food.  My favorite, most practical form of natural salt is Pink Himalayan salt.  I think it is called a &#34;finishing salt.&#34;  The Maldon Flaked Sea Salt would be useful  applying it to the tops of homemade rolls before baking them.  It holds up as well as Kosher salt but is smaller, flatter size.  I like that about it. I don't anticipate ever running out of this 8.5 oz. purchase.Martha and I don't always agree, I guess.
When I was in cooking class a few years ago, my teacher, Chef (it was required that we call him that, or else we'd fail the class), brought these crackers to class to share with all the students. Since the majority of the class was of spanish decent, a few of the students had a hard time swallowing these down, me included.I was raised with mostly land critters in my diet, so eating these were kinda like being kicked in the mouth by a fish, even though these have no fish in them. They're strong and briny, and kinda sweet too...I do have to admit though, these are addicting, once you get over the "fishy" taste.
We just got back from our monthly visit to our local Japanese fish market that luckily carries a plethora of quality Japanese pre-prepared items, including this one.  On each trip we always get a couple of jars.  We sprinkle it on regular rice, soups, vegetables and cucumber salads to add a sou san of oceanic flavor.  There is not any fish in this product; just sesame seeds, salt, seaweed and a bit of sugar.  Certainly low fat with a lot of satisfying taste factor built in.  The cost of this at our market is $2.29.  If you don't have a Japanese market near you, this is a good source for you to purchase and enjoy this product.
I love earl grey tea and enjoy the specialty earl grey teas but also like a plain earl grey without too much bitterness. This tea is perfect for that. Even if I make it strong it's not bitter. The only think against it is that there are lots of really small particles that don't get filtered in my tea maker and leave lots of little pieces in the bottom of my cup. Some of the premium brands have larger leaves and don't leave as many small pieces. The price was great compared to T...... and some other premium brands. I'll order this again.
...and I realized it's not weak; it's smooth. The farther into the cup I got, the more I was won over. This will be one of my most-consumed teas. It arrived today and already I'm on my second cup, with no slow down in sight. I recommend using two *heaping* teaspoons per cup.It would be nice if Amazon would offer this size as a stand-alone item that can be ordered without having to order it as an add-on. I am not a fan of the add-on restrictions, and I'd gladly pay shipping if Amazon would allow it.
I love lime perrier but it is very expensive so I thought I would give this a shot. It is super- fizzy - more like Perrier than Poland or the Store Brand. Lime flavor is very subtle - not over-the-top and not artificial tasting at all. No weird aftertaste. I am not thrilled that it is in a can but it is very convenient - perfect size for single serving or to pack with your lunch. Price on amazon with the subscribe and save discount is insanely good. Will reorder.
We are new to Hansen's Sparkling Water, but we really love it.  Each flavor has a clean taste and a moderate amount of fizz.  That way, you don't feel like you're drinking soda, more like....well, natural sparkling water.  We love the flavor and love having a great way to pull away from the sugary sodas.  Having tasted a few of Hansen's flavors in the Sparkling Water, we are now big fans.  PS:  getting these delivered in auto shipments from Amazon is THE BEST!
I love this because it has no sweeteners whatsoever. It's difficult to find sparkling water that has no artificial flavors or sweeteners, so I settled on this one. It's really, really fizzy and doesn't quickly lose its fizz. If you leave it out for a few hours, then it will, but you can still drink it; it doesn't turn bad like some of them. I order five separate orders of these (not just 5 in one order) so that I can get the 15 percent subscribe and save discount. That makes them much cheaper than Sprouts at 2.99 a six pack. It's like getting five cans free. Good value.
Zen brews up to an golden amber liquor.  The aroma is sweet spearmint.  The blending of this tea is excellent--spearmint could be overpowering but they use just the right amount of it.  Slightly sweet spearmint is the primary flavor, then you taste a hint of lemon.  The green tea provides an herbal base for these two flavors that makes the intial impression of zesty spearmint and lemon modulate into a substantial potion.  Very nice and satisfying with a clean spearmint aftertaste.Remember that this tea does have caffeine--however, it does not say how much on the box.  A good estimate might be 30 mg--compared to 90mg for the average cup of coffee.  Make sure you time how long you brew this tea because if you brew too long it becomes bitter.  Four minutes is ample.
I made the mistake of thinking this product was minus SLS.  Otherwise, the product does as it states.  It definitely leaves my teeth clean, my tongue has become more pink since using it (I use inhalers for asthma which causes the surface to turn white - yeast).  Anyway, when this is gone I will try another Neem toothpaste when I find one without harmful chemicals.  Yeah, yeah, I know, I am using it.  I bought it and can't bring myself to toss it.
After reading other reviews, I decided to give this item a try. As other reviewers noted, it does help with the overall health of your gums and the tissue in the mouth. I get ulcers easily and this seems to help them heal quickly and I have even noticed I do not get ulcers as easily nor do I experience sensitivity to cold products like I usually do due to having several crowns. Also, my teeth feel cleaner after brushing than with any other toothpaste that I have ever used. I have not been using this product very long but so far, I have been very impressed with the almost immediate results that I have experienced. If there are any negatives in the future, I will update this post but so far I am thrilled with Neem Active Toothpaste.
You know you are getting the worst of worst when you see so many excellent reviews written about a product that when you visit their Internet site, instead of spelling out the ingredients, publishes ***Following content is provided by Henkel India Ltd. Henkel India Ltd. has become a Jyothy Laboratories Ltd company. Henkel does not assume any responsibility for the content of this page.***Read the side effects, Canadian warning link which is posted in the comment section. This toothpaste is from India. Everyone I know, takes US made toothpaste to Asia but Amazon is trying to sell us a toothpaste from India while Canada has issued a warning. What a joke. I use neem for killing bugs in my garden since it is a great pesticide in natural form but not for internal use and don't forget, produced in India.
The taste of this coffee candy is terrific - not too sweet, not too strong, just perfect.The amount you get in this $5+ package is 32 candies. Each candy is the size of 3 nickels stacked on top of each other.  Total weight of all candies in this package is 4.23 oz (120 grams).The taste met my expectation, the amount of candies I received did not.Update: Kopiko candy inspired me to investigate other Asian Coffee Candies. If you like Kopiko I recommend that you also tryBali's Best Coffee Candy, 5.3-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12).Bali's Best has a slight stronger coffee taste compared to Kopiko Cappuccino flavor, and just slightly sweeter.  Both are fine candy, but Bali's Best is a much better deal.  See my review of Bali's Best Coffee Candy for details.
There are a lot of Chili Sauces that I like, and it really depends on what I want to use it for, but when it comes to cooking, this is the stuff. I add it to any meat to make stir-fry, chili con carne, Thai dishes, burritos, etc. It's wonderfully versatile and can be used anywhere that garlic and chilies are appropriate. One of the reasons it's so perfect for cooking is because it's not all heat. You can add a good tablespoon of this to a dish and really mix it in without killing it. With, say,Dave's Insanity Ghost Peppersauce you get lots of heat in a few drops, which can lead to uneven flavor in the dish.
If you like Asian food, and you like it HOT, this is just the ticket for you.Also good in curries and cajun dishes.Use it to stir fry shrimp, chicken, or beef, or just use it like you would anycondiment like salsa or Tabasco sauce. Amazing flavor, and trust me, this stuffis hot. About a 7 on a scale of 10. Tremendous garlic and hot chili flavor, willmake you discover cooking all over again! This will perk up any Chinese takeout,and its even good in Hot n' Sour Soup! Its very thick, almost like a paste so alittle bit goes a long way. Sells locally here for around $3. 5 Pods
Received this about a week ago and I have already used it in tacos, black beans and rice, salsa and Chinese stir fried chicken and vegetables. The primary ingredients are chili, salt, garlic and distilled vinegar. It does contain preservatives, namely potassium sulfate and sodium bisulfite so if you are allergic to sulfites you might want to avoid this sauce. Be forewarned that it is very potent so a little goes a long way. As with any spice, just add a little at a time until you reach the amount of heat that is right for you. I can't wait to mix a bit in with my pizza sauce. It is a five star sauce but I deducted a star because I think it is rather pricey.
I had heard of the health benefits associated with Bragg's Amino Acids but should have done the research first;* is higher in sodium than my Lite Soy Sauce.* this contains MSG.* I prefer the taste of soy sauce to this product.TIP: if you are concerned about your sodium intake but still want to use soy sauce the *LITE* Kikkoman Soy Sauce actually has LESS sodium in it than their Lower Sodium Soy Sauce.For my tastes/purposes this product did not have any appreciable health benefits over my lite soy sauce and therefore I would probably not purchase this again.
This is no joke, I use braggs on almost anything. My kids warn me if we are running low because it has such a great taste; especially on veggies. I usually buy several at the store to stock up and use it for cooking, grilling, spray on veggies, tofu, etc.If you like Soy Sauce or Tammari, you will love braggs, it's 100X better, seriously, try it and I'm sure you'll agree...Whoever thought this was a protien suplement for working out, well, seriously... Let's just say I had a laugh at your expense.Update Dec 17, 2011: Thats what I get for buying this online. The price has more than doubled here in less than 6 months! Fallen stars... :-(
Bragg Liquid Aminos has been a real find! I not only explored it because of the nutritional benefit but,because I wanted to find an alternative to the low sodium soy sauce or tamari which didn't accent the bases to soups or tofu marinated dishes I wanted to make. I haven't experienced the same notes many people may have in describing the taste of the liquid aminos as having to be "an acquired taste". To the contrary, I have discovered an umami-type epiphany! I would recommend those who would want to jazz up a soup base,marinade for a tofu steak, seitan burger, or the like with liquid aminos!
Bragg's makes a great seasoning for almost anything. I love that it is gluten free. All you need is a very small amount to season your food - a little goes a long way. You might even want to use a spray bottle for application. It is cheaper to buy this size and make your own spray bottle, as opposed to purchasing the Bragg's spray seasoning bottle. Despite what other reviewers say, this does make a good substitute for soy sauce. I have used it to make fried rice and used it for my sushi. When you have to eat GF, you make exceptions with food. But with Bragg's, you don't have to. It is delicious.
With wheat allergies, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure - oh, and MSG gives me migraines - getting on the right track and cooking food that tastes great requires a touch of soy sauce - but all the good tasting soy sauce has wheat in it and is WAY too high in sodium.  This stuff is WONDERFUL!Tofu scramble for breakfast (and fruit), grilled summer squash and zucchini, red lentils with greens, peppers and onions  - everything just takes a few shakes of Braggs instead of salt and WOW - going low-fat, low-salt, no-grain vegan is actually easy and very tasty!Thank you Dr. Fuhrman!!
I bought this item through Amazon because I trust the Amazon website and they have never failed me.  The Bragg Apple Cider Vinegar was delivered as promised.  I just drink shots of the vinegar so I can get it over with.  It has helped with my bloat tremendously.  I'll have to wait until my next blood test to see if my cholosterol numbers have improved.  You can see the "Mother" in the bottle.  The first drink is a little tough.  But after a few days, I got used to it and have no problem with it now.  It's best to chase the shot with a drink of water to prevent acidic damage to teeth.
I have used Bragg's products since 1967.  Now I'm questioning their quality.  Feb 5 I received Bragg's Liquid Aminos 32oz All Purpose Seasoning (Best by Aug 23, 2016).  There was liquid inside the plastic bag.  The protective seal was on but when I opened the cap, there was an index shape puncture in the seal.  I called Bragg and was told none of their employees would do something like that!  They told me to talk to Amazon.  Amazon had another bottle (no date printed on bottle) shipped and received Feb 6. (You Rocks, Amazon!!!)  The seal on the new bottle was broken and about 1/4 cup of the liquid was inside the plastic and some had leaked into the box and left a large spot on the carpet in front of my door.
Here's the skinny. I have been eating soy sauce my whole life. Braggs is very similar to soy sauce...but less well defined soy sauce flavor.Braggs: thinner bodied sauce...but still very salty. Taste like it was filtered well ...may be do to the more watery texture. Goes flat after you taste it.Kikkoman soy sauce: thicker bodied sauce. Salty. Has that asian soy sauce taste. When you taste it, it reassures your senses that it has a flavor of its own.I love using this particular soy season liquid for soups and mock veggie meat. Plus I put it in my toddlers rice...just a splash.
This is a big can - size of a regular 10 can.  It is something I have been looking for for a while and it is competitively priced.  I have just noticed our local grocer is carrying some of this stuff and their prices are similar but not quite.  My grocer has this item for 28 dollars and you can get it here for 25 dollars with prime shipping if you have it.  My grocer has cheap prices to so it is a fair comparison.  I havent broken into them yet but they will be eggs in an emergency.  I am not looking for super taste, I am looking for easy making survival stuff.  I have no reason to believe these will taste any better or worse then any other egg product out there.  It fits my needs exactly for a good price.
These are clearly great for taking on camping trips. The trick is always to reconstitute as directed, only whisking (no electric beater) the water/milk into the egg powder, starting with very little liquid to make a paste first, breaking up the lumps with the whisk. Otherwise they wont go into solution very well. They won't make as fluffy an omelet as fresh does, and some baking products really need fresh eggs, such as a souffle. Clearly they won't help you make a meringue.They are also great when you run out of eggs and cannot get to the grocery store. I keep them in the refrigerator in a few separate zip-lock bags. You can freeze them without any more loss in quality than dehydration does. I still have some left from the can I bought 15 months ago (but then I have not done much baking or eating of eggs since then).
I have an Indian (American) friend, that gets free whole powdered eggs from the gov commodity program. She has often made me "yummy/flavorfull" egg sandwiches (i.e. scrambled eggs...)!I decided to buy some Honeyville & try it? What a disappointment for scrambled eggs (don't know about baking...?)!1. Their is NO flavor, whatsoever!!!2. Sticks "hard" to oiled stainless frying pan (fried like a pancake. pre-heated to med/low)- Worked better when I mixed in 1tsp of Canola oil, per egg... (like waffles...).For 1 egg sandwich- I mix 1/4 cup water, to 1/4 cup mix (they say 2-1), which was a runny mess (maybe for baking?).Limited shelf life...- I store unused mix in the freezer!
We have chickens for fresh eggs but in storing up for long term food storage and for using in baking, this is an awesome idea.  Now, we are spoiled with our fresh eggs but if using these dry ones and if a person mixes something in with them for an egg scramble, they become 'okay'.  It's all in what you add and how you season and let's face it, they are dry so nothing will taste like the real thing.  Dry goods like this are awesome because you can make your own mixes ahead of time and just add liquid, which saves a lot of time if you are in a pinch.I recommend everyone have some on their shelf.
If you want a great tasting snack that is relatively healthy, I would highly recommend this product.  But beware, once you have eaten one, you will want more.  I leave a bowl of these chips on our kitchen island and we are constantly walking past the bowl grabbing one or two on our way to do chores.  They are slightly sweet.but the sweetness does not overpower the banana flavor.  I plan to order 2 more cans to store so that we can be sure we won't run out.  I will definitely reorder when we open the last can.
I was delighted to receive my Honeyville banana snacks. The taste is just like the ones you get in the bins in the grocery store, but these are available in bulk, and come in a sealed can for long shelf life. They really taste great, and make a healthy snack. The banana chips are crisp, and they are oily from the coconut oil. Do not fret, as the latest studies indicate that coconut oil is the healthiest oil available, and so much so they actually sell coconut oil capsules as a vitamin supplement. These banana chips are a delicious way to add the health benefits of coconut oil to your diet.Healthy, tasty, and long shelf life . . . what more could you want?
I never got around to trying to bake with these because I just used them as a snack rather than regular chips or sweets.  I think these would be great in trail mix or just plain as I've been eating them.  I don't eat massive quantities of them, so I'm not concerned about the coconut oil or the small amount of sugar added.  I just eat them to take the edge off hunger sometimes between meals.  Honeyville does sell freeze-dried bananas though if you're concerned about additives.
I will be baking with this gluten for next 3 months MOL. No more problems finding gluten for mixed grain bread. Have you ever made attempt to make oats/flex see/ sesame/ whatever/whatever bread with no gluten? Did this result in a 3 inch thick tortilla for coons instead of bread loaf for people? Here is your answer - gluten. This one is at lowest price you can get and quality is superb. I am no longer buying those "5 grain Italian" bread loafs from the supermarket for 5 bucks a pop because I noticed they started to contain ingredients I cannot pronounce. LOL. I switched completely to home baked bread and it is tastier, better, cheaper and logical. Get this and get dry yeast. Look up some recipes from the Internet. Life is good and simple - so is the bread. You just need ingredients to prove the point. This is a major one.
This wheat gluten was processed on equipment that also processes peanuts, tree nuts, eggs, and soy.It would be really nice if Amazon required allergen statements on grocery items since its policy is that it does not allow returns on groceries.I don't really like hurting a product's ratings, but the vendor can certainly (and SHOULD) include this sort of critical information about the product's contents. All you have to do is upload a photo of the label.Anyhow, if you have severe food allergies to these substances, be forewarned. This isn't the product for you.
For years I've usedHodgson Mill Vital Wheat Gluten with Vitamin Cto amp up the gluten in my bread dough.  I love the stuff.  My loaves look and taste better with it.I get the same results with Honeyville Vital Wheat Gluten.  You'd be surprised how big the can is!  Don't be deceived by the price.  Hodgson Mill is actually cheaper per use, but at one tablespoon per loaf, it takes a long time to use it up.  If it expires, you've wasted money, and that isn't cheaper.  The instructions on the side of this can are a bit confusing to me because I don't have a kitchen scale.  I just use a scant quarter-cup.  I make my bread with whole wheat flour, so more gluten definitely improves the texture.Very highly recommended.  And when it's empty, you can play drums with the can.
This is a nice product. I was going to try this at home and I am glad I did. I bought a smaller quantity to use before purchasing 50lb bag for work. I won't be able to use this product at my school. I picked this vital wheat gluten over hi-gluten wheat flour so to save step in rinsing the wheat starch before turning it into Seitan. I am going to try make vegan meatball and vegan corn beef out of this. I wish the manufacturer would state the allergens on this product description.I uploaded pictures of the can so everyone who have someone allergic to nuts or etc have a chance to review before buying. It's a good product with exception.
I have purchased this product several times and it's consistently a good product. However, all three bags will not close once opened. The bag has a narrow press together zipper and it's a horrible design. Once the fine meal gets into the groove, forget about closing it again, even with an effort to clean it out. I only hope Honeyville reads these reviews because i'd like to see them go for a different bag that has the movable zipper type of closure. I always have to fold the top and put on a couple of rubber bands to keep it secure.
I purchased this from Honeyville, since it was suggested in a review & was a little less expensive.  I made banana bread with this first, as a test.  Because if the banana bread I love doesn't come out right, then nothing will.  The banana bread was bad.  It was grainy & bland & you can taste it. And it looked weird.  The texture was off. I make amazing banana bread! I threw it out.  I've never used anything but regular flour to bake, so I thought I would try this almond flour since it's suppose to be much healthier w/much less carbs.  I thought it might be a miracle flour...but it's not.  I have yet to find anything w/less carbs, or less sugar, or less this and lighter that, that tastes good.  Life's too short not to have decent banana bread.
My wife and I said never again would we make almond pancakes, they were just to grainy and nothing like a regular pancake.  There was just something about the texture we couldn't handle.  Until I saw this product on Amazon and decided to give it a try.  It was like eating regular pancakes!! The texture was spot on to a regular pancake, the taste will always be different but we will keep making them with this flour and they will turn out great every time.  Highly recommend this product!!!
I have been experimenting with various low-carb/paleo baked goods using almond flour. After trying to grind my own nuts to save cost, I decided to see what commercially ground almond flour could do for me. It's definitely an improvement in consistency over what I can achieve using a food processor, spice grinder or blender. My only ding is for the lumps. To use this flour, I have to pass it through a sifter to eliminate the many lumps. But I don't have enough experience with other brands to say whether Honeyville's is any better or worse in this respect than other brands are. It may be that the nature of almond flour is that all of them will tend to be lumpy because that's just what happens to it when it's packed for shipping. I certainly wouldn't want them to add anything to it to prevent the lumps (like cornstarch, etc.), since that would change its baking characteristics and potentially add carbohydrates, not to mention possible allergens.
I've tried quite a few brands of almond meal and have enjoyed many of the brands/types I've gotten.  I purchased this one on Amazon by reading the reviews and they were all generally good.  When I received this almond meal I was happy with the smell of it and the texture.  This is the best almond meal that I've used so far.  It has tons of flavor and stirs well into the baked goods I've made with it.  There weren't any clumps in the batter that I've gotten with some of the other almond meals I've used.  I highly recommend this almond meal for baking.
We've now bought two packages of this flour, and are highly recommending it to others.  It's absolutely great for a gluten free diet, and easy to work with.  I'm the gluten free one, my wife is the cook.  She loves working with it, I love the results, what's not to like?  Yes, the price is far higher than cheap wheat flour, but such is life in the gluten free world.  This is one time when, within reason of course, the product is well worth the price if you really want something that tastes good.  Two Thanksgiving pies were made with this flour, and others had no idea they were eating gluten free pies.  And a previous lemon meringue pie using the almond meal flour was superb - something in the combination of the lemon meringue and the almond meal flour apparently made for a delicious pie.
I was excited to find this almond flour because it's much less expensive than other brands and because it's so highly rated. I use a lot of almond flour, so I didn't hesitate to order five pounds of it. When it arrived, however, the flour was full of hard lumps. I finally worked my way to the end of it and I'm glad to see it gone. Some of the lumps were so huge they filled a quarter cup measure. So, I had to spend a great deal of my scarce baking time mashing lumps out of the almond flour with a fork. I tried measuring by weight instead of volume so I didn't have to work out the lumps first, but even whirring it around in the food processor only managed to break the huge lumps into smaller lumps. I won't buy this again.
I have been ordering this almond flour for years.  It is a great quality.  I get consistent, delicious baked goods.However, the price has been really creeping up over the years.  I'm not sure if that's a supply and demand issue?  It feels like it's more of a &#34;now that we realize people really want it we can charge more&#34; issue.I'm still buying it, but if the price goes up much more, I might have to search other brands for alternatives.
This brand of almond flour is very, very fine grain. This leads to a superior texture when used in cakes, cookies, and other treats. For those purposes, I'd say this is vastly better than Bob's Red Mill.That being said, Bob's Red Mill's larger grain almond flour might be better for crusted chicken and such. It would depend on your preference.I'm very pleased with the quality and price of the product. I highly recommend it for low carb,gluten free, and/or grain free folks!
I have used this product for the past month for my Gluten Free, sugar free, soy free, dairy free eating habbits.I absolutely love eating this and the delicious baked goods from pizza crusts to chip cookies and breads. Recipes from the spunky coconut and elana's pantry will help you get started and keep U fullfilled!Eating Almond based leaves you so satified and full. The GF diet tends to be very starchy/high carb diet. I realized the "hang-over" from, firstly, the sugar and high carbs were making me feel ill & sleepy after eating.ONE DAY is the difference! No bloating, no belly/digestive discomfort.It is so nice to be able to get this from Amazon! However, Honeyville is the best price at 29.99 with 4.49 shipping. Purchase the 25lb bg. for the best price/lb.[...][...][...]
I bought this grapeseed oil for making soap.  The price is right and it works great!  My soap comes out just the way I expect it to every time.  Highly recommended to those interested in making cold process soaps with lye.I have also started using it as a replacement for "vegetable oil" in recipes.  I don't feel comfortable using actual vegetable oil (which is usually soybean oil), and I usually substitute with olive oil...but sometimes I don't want things to taste like olive!  This grapeseed oil has a very light flavor that does not affect the taste of recipes.  I also feel good about the high smoke point; this makes it an ideal oil for use in cooking and baking.
When exploring more vegetarian cooking, I noted in Mark Bittman's vegetarian cookbook that he recommends grapeseed oil for stir fry dishes. It was in the context of experimenting with adding tofu to our diets that I reflected upon this. One of the dishes I wanted to explore was tofu stir fry. I bought another grapeseed oil product and enjoyed its usefulness greatly. But it was in a small bottle and quickly ran out.Then, I purchased Mantova Grape Seed Oil. I am also very satisfied with this product. One of Grapeseed oil's great strengths is that it has a higher heating temperasture than, say, olive oil. So you don't get smoking nearly as quickly. I have been very pleased as I have used this with tofu stir fry, and I expect it to continue to perform well in the future.And the price is pretty friendly to boot! The first Grapeseed Oil that I bought from a local store did its job well, but it was pricier than this product.So, I'm a pretty happy customer!
I really enjoy flavored coffees so when we opened the 12 pod sample pack that came with our new Keurig machine, I was excited to find a sample k cup of Van Houtte's French Vanilla.  It ended up being one of the best flavors we had an opportunity to try!Van Houtte's French Vanilla is not quite as good as some of the french vanilla coffees I've had fresh brewed at local coffee shops, but it isn't too far off either.  It's a very mild, but flavorful coffee with a smooth finish and no bitter aftertaste.  I don't like extra dark coffees with lots of acidity, so of that's more your cup of tea, so to speak, this blend isn't for you.I will definitely be picking up more of this blend and if you're in the market for a french vanilla flavored coffee k up for your Keurig brewer, this one is an excellent choice.
A sample of these Van Houtte "French Vanilla K-Cups" were included with my Keurig B-40 B40 Elite Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System and it was fairly disappointing to me. This seems to be a "hit-or-miss" flavor since there are so many positive reviews and a scattering of those who, like me, don't like it.When made on the "Large Cup" setting, the French Vanilla flavor was weak and slightly artificial tasting. It isn't really bad or undrinkable, but I will not be buying this flavor in the future.CFH
We tried some of this in our new Keurig coffee maker and it was just OK.  This is a lighter brewed cup of coffee with a very sweet taste.  It was so sweet that I actually ate a small bit of food with it and it made the coffee taste better to me as it took the sweet edge off of the flavor.  I gave it a 4 star rating as my wife loved it but for me it was a 3 or four star.I could drink it without problems but it is not my favorite.  It was a smooth flavor and not bitter but the vanilla flavor was a little light.  You may have to cut back on any sweetener if you use any.  I brewed a medium cup size of coffee. I posted a photo of the K-Cup.
I could certainly go on for more than 20 words about how much I hated this coffee.  Fortunately I didn't pay for it because it came with my machine as a sampler.  Yuck!  It doesn't taste like good coffee and it doesn't taste like French Vanilla.  Point blank I couldn't even finish the cup and had to pour it down the drain.  The aftertaste is even worse.  I don't understand how anyone could give this a positive review but I guess it's all a matter of individual preference.
Another Amazon reviewer whose opinion I respect recommended this brand of steel cut oats. I have been wanting to try steel cut oats. These are tasty. You can cook them for 10-20 minutes depending if you want them firmer or softer. There's a recipe on the package which won an oatmeal taste contest. I add soy milk and cinnamon to the oats when they've completed cooking. Brown sugar and pecans would be a tasty alternative. These are a delicious source of whole grains and one serving supplies most of you daily whole grain requirements.
I love oatmeal and always purchased rolled or instant oats. I never knew what I was missing out on until I tried steel cut oatmeal.  There is so much more flavor, great texture, and nutrition compared to rolled oats. It's nutty aroma fills the kitchen. This oat cereal does take a little longer to cook (around 20-30 minutes) but believe me, it is well worth it. I add a little brown sugar, cream, and low fat butter to mine and it makes a perfect, healthy breakfast.
Spectrum Light Canola Mayo is an eggless mayonnaise substitute. I bought a jar of this at my local store, as it was on clearance and I'm trying to avoid eating real egg products. It has a very good smell, like real mayonnaise; however, I was put off by its gummy texture. It has a passable flavor-somewhat tangy like the real stuff-but it also tastes very floury. The biggest downside to this mayo is that it leaves a terrible aftertaste for hours. I won't be buying this mayonnaise again.
Now, this is trail mix I`m  talking about. not rhe peanut butter or the flaxceed bars.This one is outstanding in flavor and in texture (though a little lumpy to chew and maybe a litttle dry)and quality ingredients.A great granola bar.(as a tip put a thin coating of splenda or stevia across the top to give it a little more sweetness)When amazon ran out a few weeks ago ,i ordered a case from another vendor at a slightly higher price That is something i usually do not do.Good job from kashi on this one;and for amazon, aces all the way.note: the sweetener is just my preference, the bars are fine as they are.
This bar is just too awesome to put into words. It is a Chocolate Mocha granola bar that actually tastes like Chocolate Mocha! It really is one of those rare products that have low fat and the entire flavor it promotes. The funny thing is I ordered it for myself and gave a few to my workout buddies, big mistake since they just kept coming back for more bars promising to `get me back'. Maybe that is true since I saw them order a few boxes but since these are highly addictive I think they may keep their `stash' to themselves. Well any way if you are watching your weight, working out or simply like granola type products I recommend these nifty Dark Mocha Almond bars. Funny thing is I was just looking for a few healthy snack products to satisfy my sweet tooth and really didn't expect them to be this good, oh and they are.
Its a Kashi bar. healthy, good ingredients yadda yadda yadda.It has a fancy name too ! 'Dark Mocha Almond'.Was pretty excited about these. Orded a 6 pack of 6 bars each and i now have 36 coffee flavored coffee bars.A good description for these would be coffee granola bars because they taste just like that. The little chunks of dark chocolate are not too sweet and with the rest of the oatmeal they have a very distinct coffee flavor to the entire thing.I liked it. but was expecting something more 'chocolately'.
When I originally reviewed the 12-pack of these, they were 30% more expensive than elsewhere, but now, via subscription, this is a better price than I can get at any store.  They are as fresh or fresher than those bought in stores, and each unit of four six-bar packages is sealed in heavy-duty plastic.  Delivery is prompt as well.  I agree with the "Leading consumer magazine" that rated these to be the best of all granola bars.  They have no cheap, unhealthy ingredients -- just stuff that tastes great and is good for us, barring allergies.
These are good granola bars.  We buy them at the grocery store but are way cheaper here.  The only problem is sometimes they get very hard (the grocery store ones are softer).  I'm not sure if that's from shipping here in a cold climate or what.  Also, the expiration date can be very close.  I was getting low on the bars and then ordered more and realized the expirate date is coming up in a few weeks when the last case had a later date.  So it makes me wonder how fresh these are.
The tasty peanut taste and chewiness makes this a very satisfying and somewhat healthy snack...it's a little bit higher on the fat content (5g) than what I normally select. One star off because it doesn't really have as many peanuts on it as shown in the box, and because it's really not "peanut buttery" at all (i.e., it doesn't have any peanut butter layer or any peanut buttery creaminess to it the way some of the chocolate versions really have a chocolate-y layer).  It's more on the dry side and chewy.  Still tasty, though.  I noticed the price doubled recently, so the "deal" is not as good now.
Kellogg agreed to remove &#8220;all natural&#8221; labeling from its line of Kashi and Bear Naked products, which the lawsuit claimed contain several artificial ingredients. In addition, they're setting aside $5 million in a fund to dole out 50-cent refunds to Kashi customers and $325,000 for Bear Naked customers. They do not seem to disclose all ingredients and after further research, apparently Kashi is owned by Kellogg and donated some $790,700 dollars to defeat prop 37, GM labelling in CA. The question is why wouldn't they want me to know the exact ingredients, after all I am paying for the product.
These are the absolute best bars I've ever tasted. They are chocolate-ly and not overly sweet. They manage to be both chewy and crunchy in just the right amounts. The coffee taste is very light and blends well with the other ingredients.These little bars are only 130 each, provide 6 grams of protein and are made with whole grains and oatmeal. I eat these every day as an afternoon snack. Around 2 or 3, I'm craving a candy bar but I eat one of these instead and I'm ok until dinner. Saves me about 150 calories a day. The only criticism that I have for these bars is that there are not enough almonds in them. They are so good though that I still have to give them 5 stars.
t's a close call, but if you're someone who eats breakfast in transit, Kashi Granola Bars have an edge over both the Nutrigrain too-sweet entries and the crumbly Nature Valley competitors. Neither a treat nor a treatment, Kashi Granola bars are light and just right--a way to get started without either residual guilt over a 7 A.M. candy bar or aversion to grandma's recommended fiber remedy. One warning: they go down easy, so don't take more than a single one with you in the car (or you could wind up scarfing down all six bars between traffic lights). Also, Amazon ships these three-buck packages in a generous-sized box, which may strike some consumers as ecologically irresponsible (wish I'd saved these boxes for a recent move of my mother-in-law. I think I ended up paying more for comparable new ones than the cost of the granola bars).
Pros:Great mocha taste that doesn't overpower other flavors.Lots of dark chocolate chips to satisfy chocolate cravings.One bar is very filling and satisfying.Lots of protein and fiber.Made with whole grains.Contains no high fructose corn syrup, or artificial ingredients.Very little sugar.Contains whole or nearly whole almonds versus little pieces.Cons:More expensive than some other granola bars, but very much worth it.Overall:I'd recommend these bars to anyone who enjoys the flavor of mocha.  I love these, they taste oh so good.
I like using protein bars for breakfasts on the go and as meal supplements, so I'm always looking to find new ones that are healthy AND taste great.  Kashi's GOLEAN bar in the Oatmeal Raisin Cookie flavor is my latest discovery.  The tasty bar really is reminiscent of an oatmeal cookie, with a similar chewy texture.  It also offers 13 grams of protein--not as high as some sports-marketed bars, but still very good--and a whopping 6 grams of fiber (more than All Bran bars!).  An added bonus is the 10% RDA of Calcium, and finally, like all Kashi products, these bars are made with seven whole grains.  Definitely a recommended addition to any healthy diet!
Yes, these are actually the best yummy meal replacement bar out there. Delicious. However, after seeing some of the other reviews, it seems people are not totally clear on WHAT this product actually is-- yes, they have 280 (290?) calories a pop-- but they also have protein and 6 grams of fiber-- they are a MEAL REPLACEMENT bar, not a little 100 cal snack. If, like me, you can afford a 300 calorie snack in your day, then no, this doesn't mean you have to eat one of these for your lunch. But these are MUCH more filling (thanks to fiber) and satisfying than say, a Nutri Grain bar, which tastes like bread and jam mush. The Cookies and Cream and PB flavors are also great, but for whatever reason, I can never find this variety in-store, so I order them off of Amazon, like so many other things.
I was not expecting it, but this bar has what seems to be a watered-down yogurt coating.The bar tastes fairly decent, but I wouldn't exactly call it oatmeal raisin.  It has a distinct raw cookie dough flavoring to it.  There doesn't seem to be much oatmeal taste.There are plenty of other bars out there with less fat (and FAR less saturated fat) that actually taste better.  This is a quality bar, no doubt, as are all Kashi products, but I would not care to use it as a meal replacement on a daily basis.
This is a super snack to grab when you're about to miss breakfast.  It's not a full breakfast replacement, but you can supplement it with a bit of fruit or yogurt an hour or so later and have a happy tummy.Even better... this is a great dessert... one that satisfies a crunchy sweet craving but doesn't make you feel too guilty.  A lot fewer calories than a typical donut, plus a good helping of fiber and all-natural ingredients.Kashi's done it again.  Tasty, reasonably nutritious.
I love these more than any granola, energy, meal or any other bar I have ever tried... And I've probably tried them all. They're sweet, cinnamon-y, and remind me a little of spice cake; they've also got little pieces of hazlenut in them which adds a nice nutty flavor to the whole thing, and the frosting type substance is really good too. The texture is like a crispy rice cereal bar, but much better (to me anyway), and they're chewy, don't buy these expecting them to be like the crunchy Nautre Valley granola bars. These have got lots of fiber and protein, so they're quite filling, and they're low in fat, and the fats they do have are good fats. They're also made with healthy, natural ingredients that are really good for you. I would absolutely recommend giving these a try.
The nutrition profile on this line of bars was great!  High protein and fiber, low fat, not excessively sweet, very satisfying for the modest calories. It became my go-to breakfast and I haven't yet found a replacement.It was always hard to find them cheap, and right when Costco started offering them, Kashi decides to discontinue them.  Maybe the product would have done better with the word &#34;protein&#34; in the name.  Let's hope they will be adding something new that has a similar nutrition profile.
If you're a former junk food junkie like me, then you'll get an idea of what these things taste like when I describe them as a more fibrous (chewy) version of rice kripy squares with a chocolate coating on the bottom.  They really are that delicious.  And at 170 calories with 4gm of fat (1.5gm saturated), 9gm of protein, and 5gm of fiber, they are a healthy alternative to many other types of snacks that one could indulge in (pastries, candy, etc).These are easily my favorite protein bar and I've tried over a dozen kinds.Edit on 9/27/07:  This review pertains to the chocolate peanut Go Lean flavor.  I just noticed that Amazon is grouping reviews for all of Kashi's bars together, so without specificity in the review it's impossible to know which product is being reviewed.
I have reviewed a lot of these snack bars over the past couple of years, this is by far the most delicious. I would eat one every day.That's really not hyperbole. Yesterday I had a Pure Protein S'more. I thought. Oh that was good. Not really S'more flavoured, but I liked it. Today, I moved on to this one and it's just the right amount of sweet, chew, cinnamon...only 160 calories, 8g protein, 5g of fiber...ok so some of the other bars are a little more packed with fiber and protein, but they don't taste this good.Kashi, you done good! (Not that I am surprised)
We normally brew a full pot of coffee in our home each morning as there are enough coffee drinkers to make it worthwhile. But in the afternoon, sometimes one of us wants a cup and it is not worthwhile to brew another pot or grind up the beans to make a smaller pot. That's what we have our Senseo for. We keep a couple different kinds of pods around to suit various tastes, and this one suits mine.These are a little stronger, and more full-bodied than the basic medium roast Senseo pods, yet the flavor is not quite as acidic as their dark roast pods. I use one pod for a "double" serving (the button with the 2 cups), which is (I know) not the recommended way, but I still seem to get good results. If I happen to be making one first thing in the morning and need a little more strength, I will use 2 pods and press the double first, and then the single to get a slightly larger and stronger cup.
My husband actually did not like this flavor, but he isn't that big into Vanilla.  However, my in-laws raved!  They may actually buy a Senseo based on trying ours.  They didn't want to drink all of our coffee, but we said go ahead since my husband didn't like it.  They must have had 3 cups each of this coffee, it was like they couldn't get enough.  I suggest that you actually try any Senseo flavor by buying one pack at the store first to see if you like the flavor.  If you do, come back to Amazon and order in bulk to save you money.  $3.84 at Walmart for a package of 10 pods = .38 each.  Here it is only .25 a cup of coffee at the current price.
Anyone who really loves a gourmet cup of coffee will HATE this! It's burnt, bitter, weak, battery-acid! And, as consequence, those coffee lovers may begin to hate their new Senseo -- but take heart! Many online coffee shops now offer decent to delectable coffees at prices that rival this cheap swill. I don't specifically want to endorse any one product or online retailer but do a google search for "senseo compatible pods" and you'll find several on the first page. Also, please note that while these may initially seem pricier, most third party pods work with JUST ONE to make an 8-ounce cup instead of the two pods that Senseo brand products demand. You do the math and it works out to be a comparable costing cup of joe.[...]
My pods arrived in good condition.Somewhat surprised they were shipped in the original packaging but seems to work out fine.This coffee is strong compared to most pods but I like stronger coffee.I do leave my pod in the maker and when I have drank about half my cup of coffee I go back and refresh it using the same pod.I add about 3 to 4 ozs and it taste great and reheats the coffee up a bit.I had no problem with broken pods so far and the expiration date is on each pack but due to the colors its almost impossible to see or read anything on the package.The date is clearly stated on the outside of the box the six packs come in though.Overall I am pleased with this coffee.
I was really happy to see this coffee for such a great price. I even got a better price using the additional Senseo coupon code.As soon as I got the pods I brewed my first cup of . . . "the weakest coffee ever except for when I forgot to add the coffee to the coffee maker." I was really disappointed.After reading the package I discovered I could use two pods to improve the flavor. Of course this also doubled the price making the deal not so good after all. Using two pods was a little too strong for my taste. Senseo rates the coffee as between mild and med. It was VERY, VERY mild!In all fairness to this product, I purchased these pods to use with my EZ-Cup in my Keurig. So perhaps they would make better tasting coffee in the Senseo pod coffee maker.
This Senseo espresso is not of the same quality as it's predecessor, but since the ECE pods are getting harder to find on the market, I buy it fairly often.  The Senseo system is a winner which is, oddly enough, losing to the slower-brewed, crema-free Keurig phenomena which is nearly ubiquitous and very adequate, even okay.  Go with the Senseo-- it's cheaper, better, and a no-brainer. This espresso is a little rough around the edges, and the darker roast fries out some of the subtleties that a better grade of coffee enhances.  It's good enough on its own, better for mixed coffee drinks.  If you're not a connoisseur, this will more than meet your needs.
We love it for 3 o'clock coffee like we make in the Senseo now (we prefer Lipton green tea in the AM as less letdown, see my review forLipton Green Tea, Mandarin Orange, Premium Pyramid Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)for a nice recipe for a pot).  Really fantastic flavor that I can mix with the Philips 00704 SENSEO Coffee Pods Dark Roast orPhilips 00703 SENSEO Coffee Pods Medium Roast.  This one is only on Amazon as I can't find it in any of our local stores--too bad since it is the best one :-), but you get it here.  15% off if you subscribe and free 2-day delivery with Amazon Prime membership, don't forget.  I used to mess with the expensiveExclusive, Aloha Island, Kona-Hawaiian Coffee Pods! Our Fabulous 20% Pure Kona Coffee! ESTATE BLEND Medium Roast - 12 KONA-PODS!but much more expensive and the taste is no better.  Enjoy!
Some of the Senseo pods lack character and are, frankly, quite bland. However, the Sumatra Blend has a lot of character and tastes very good. It has a smokey, dark flavor to it, reminicent of darker chocolates. I've enjoyed drinking this coffee black, with cream and sweetener, and with flavored creamers. All of them tasted good and the undertones of the coffee even stood out with the flavored creamer, a characterist often lacking in the Senseo Pods. Bottom Line: this coffee tastes great ! ! !
I previously tried Senseo's Kona Blend back in 2011 and was very disappointed. I didn't think I would ever try it again. After shopping for what was currently available, I decided to give this another try and I'm very glad I did so. This latest order received July 2013 is a great blend. The freshness date on my packages is 05-03-14. I highly recommend this, and the price through Amazon is excellent - especially considering that you really cannot find this in stores! I usually go with stronger/darker coffee, but since Senseo has been more difficult to find I had settled on a Melitta dark roast that really did not give me a satisfying flavor profile. It was just blah. This Senseo offering is very satisfying and compared to a cup of freshly ground beans I would favor the Kona Blend pod.
These coffee pods are very, very weak. I started with one pod, no flavor. 2 pods, a bit better but still weak and watery. 3 pods was all I get into my little Hamilton Beach but there was still no Hazelnut taste. I finally used 2 pods for just a half a cup and though it was somewhat stronger, there was still no taste. Very disappointed in this selection, looking around for some other brands.March 24, 20012I like to update this review and give it 5 stars because I think I was a bit hasty the first time around. I only tried it in a cheap little 1-cup pot and I think that was the problem. I now use the pods in a 4-cup Mr. Coffee and it comes out absolutely delicious. I love the smell when it perks and enjoy the of it taste every morning. In fact, I'm ready to send in my next oder!
The brand of Senseo that came with my little coffee pod machine was stronger than I liked so I tried a four pack of Columbiacoffee and the first pod was so strong that it upset my stomach.  The next two were terrible and I dumped both cups.  Since then I have tried diluting  each pod with some water but the rotten taste persists.  I bought a large coffee at a popular drive in and it was really strong and would have been refused back in the WWII era.  NEEDLESS TO SAY, NEVER ANOTHER SENSEO COFFEE POD IN MY HOUSE, EVER AGAIN!I don't blame Amazon for my mistakes but it really irks me to throw out twenty some dollars worth of worthless SENSEO coffee pods.  Will keep the pod machine to heat water for tea.  My suggestion is for people to buy coffee and filters from your local stores, at least most of it is drinkable and so much cheaper!
This hubby's favorite brand of coffee as it's rich tasting and easy to use. He was delighted to find this at Amazon as this type of coffee filter/pod seems to have disappeared from local grocery shelves.Things he likes best:1.  Rich coffee flavor2.  Easy to use in the morning and it saves time. Good for when you are sleepy too and need a little extra help. :-)3.  Great for taking on vacation as this pod works in most hotel/motel coffee pots.Recommend.
This is one of the better tasting Senseo pods out there, but it is not Kona coffee.  It contains only 10% Kona coffee, the other 90% is something else.  If you want Kona coffee, go buy Kona coffee.  This Kona "blend" won't taste anything like it.Names aside, as I stated this is one of the better tasting Senseo pods.  Four stars are based on rating Senseo coffee.  It would get less stars if I was just rating "coffee".
We wish coffee tasted as good as it smells but have never found any that does.  This smells delicious and is ok but a lot weaker than we're used to.  Since the little cup-pod type single cup makers coffee is way too strong for all of us this was a more sensible alternative.  We'll keep trying to figure a way of making it stronger without being too strong.  Two discs didn't work.  All in all, it's a better coffee than we get trying to make one cup in a 12-cup coffee maker.  ;)
You have all heard of celery stalks that have negative calories because it takes so many calories to chew them.  Well, these are candies that work in a similar way.  It takes so much work and frustration to unwrap each little square that you can eat the piece without worrying about calories.  If this is what the manufacturers intended, I can only commend them, but I have a sneaky suspicion that the extreme difficulty of getting to the candy has been produced by incorrect storage during the hot summer months.Can't beat the taste, though.  Once out of the wrapper, they are wonderful!
SOMETIMES A TOOTHPICK CAN BE FUN!50 packs of these seems like enough to keep you in the picks for a while. They taste like cinnamon and its a nice touch that they are sugar-free.Seeing these old standard-bearers among the after dinner set brings back the old days, and then I see all these plastic tooth picks that come with floss already attached and I think, "wow, so this is progress?!"THE BOTTOM LINE:Anyway, if you are looking for decent cinnamon tasting toothpicks that are a decent value, come in handy little packages and are sugar-free, you're in for a treat -- HERE THEY ARE!
Yeah. Toothpicks. For $7 no less. What a bargain!!! And they are flavored? No way. That's so cool. Why didn't anyone think of this - well besides Joe in Middle School - with flavoring for next to nothing. But still, a seven dollar tooth pick is my idea of fun. And even better - if you get sick of them you can sell them on ebay as pieces of the crucifix that Jesus was hanged on (or the guy that played him in The Passion)
I first had King Leo soft peppermint sticks about twenty years ago and fell in love. These are NOT hard candies, nor are they chewy. The consistency is somewhat similar to those small pastel after-dinner mints, although a bit harder. The peppermint flavor is nicely balanced with the sweetness of the candy, neither too sweet nor too minty. When first put in the mouth, they seem to be a hard candy, but after a few minutes, they begin dissolving into a smooth, softer-but-still-crunchy delicious treat. I love this particular style more than the sticks as instead of holding the stick, these are just popped into the mouth. These are individually wrapped so they are perfect for communal candy jars or for purse or pocket. A lovely little treat any time of the day.
Nice peppermint candies for when you want the lift that a mint can give you.  The fact that they are &#34;soft&#34; makes them easier to eat and you won't break a tooth filling on them if (when) you bite down.  Peppermint flavoring is strong and really peppermint, not the  cheap flavoring that might be as much spearmint as peppermint, and you probably know how disappointing it is to think you are getting peppermint and end up with a taste that is nothing like that except that it's &#34;mint&#34; of some kind.These are good.
I don't know why I'd never heard of these or tried them until now - I guess because I was never into peppermints.  Well, now that I'm older and having digestive issues, I decided to try some peppermint candies from the store.  They turned out to be 'Soft Peppermint'.  I never knew there was a hard or soft peppermint...I thought they were all hard.I looked on Amazon and here were soft peppermints.  I've been eating them since they arrived 2 days ago.  Just the right amount of peppermint.  I would say the texture is like a 'butter mint' or 'after dinner mint'.  It dissolves on your tongue or you can crunch them for a faster meltdown.  I just assumed all candy that was red and white were hard peppermints.  Twenty three dollars for five pounds...a better deal than buying them in my town.Addendum:  Back for more.
I bought these before in a tub for Christmas and everyone was asking me where did I get them because they were so good!  This year I bought little cardboard-like paper boxes (looked like little gingerbread houses) and filled them with these luscious mints for all my friends, neighbors and family as gifts and everyone LOVED them! I keep a medium sized candy dish in the living room and always find it getting low with all the company and passers by taking one or more. These mints melt in your mouth and are the first mints I've found that are delicious and just softly minty!
I'm probably being TOO picky, cause the truth is, I've never gotten a burst of true, full blueberry flavor in any preserve/jam of that fruit I've tried. I don't know if the heating lessens the flavor or what.So, while this wasn't as "true fruity" flavored as the apricot, it was very pleasant and I enjoyed it. It has the same semi-puree consistency as the other Nature's Hollow preserve I've tried. For sugar-free, this is really nice. Only 2 grams of effective carbs per tablespoon, with 20 calories per tbsp. Ingredients: blueberries, xylitol, spring water, fruit pectin, citric acid. I like that simple list of ingredients. :)I am eager to try the strawberry one, now. :D
I should have paid closer attention to the product (jar) size, that's my fault. It is a tiny jar, ten ounces. This equates to somewhere close to 2 bucks for a tablespoon full. (I paid 14 dollars for the jar)As for the taste, The jam is VERY good, and I guess if you're a billionaire, or maybe a federal employee (joking) you could afford it. As for me, I guess I'll have to go back to the store brand. Yikes! I do wonder in an effort to be fair if I should reconsider the number of stars I gave the product, considering how good it is, what do you think?
I've skipped past this one a few times because of the negative reviews on here describing the color and texture of this dish.  Having had this for lunch today, I will say that the only thing gross about this dish are the few 'in poor taste' reviews (even our four year old has enough common sense to refrain from poopy jokes at the dinner table).  Simply put, it looks like a dark green, creamed spinach soup.  That is all.  The taste is amazing and the paneer cheese cubes add nice texture and a mellow contrasting flavor to this spicy, curried spinach and tomato dish.  I will definitely repurchase this one again.
The paneer cheese cubes (soft, lightly flavored cheese cubes) are one of my favorite accents in a dish, and Tasty Bite does an amazing job of them. The spinach is blended into the curry sauce, so there are no actual leaves of spinach, it is like a thick saucy stew with the cheese being the only chunks.It is really delicious and well-flavored, but this dish kind of needs either a piece of bread (pita, french bread) or some rice to go with it to sop up the sauce. I eat them by themselves sometimes but the flavor is so highly concentrated that a little bit of starch to balance it out makes it a really perfect quick meal.
This is the least appetizing of the Tasty Bite entrees, in appearance. It tastes good. However, the texture is smoother than in the illustration, more like spinach baby food, and the color is a bit browner than depicted. It has a mild spiciness. There is usually somewhat less paneer than shown in the illustration.Bottom line, it tastes good, but it looks like baby poo.  That may be rude but it is the truth and it must be said.Nutrition information:Note that there are TWO servings in the package and this information is for ONE serving, so if you eat the whole box, double it.Calories 133Calories from fat 72Total fat 8gSaturated fat 3gSodium 693mg !!!Total carbs 8gDietary fiber 3gSugars 2gProtein 6gVitamin A 44%Vitamin C 5%Calcium 15%Iron 16%
This is now one of my favorites.  Had it for lunch as a soup.  I do think that the Tasty Bite portions are on the small size for claiming two servings (unless you're serving it with other food items) but they're always just the right amount to fill me up.  This one in particular I found to be extremely filling.  Tastes just like a mildly spicy beef chili without the beef.  Tofu and an extra can of kidney beans stirred into the mix could easily make this a filling meal for four.
I came across this product at Costco when they were giving out samples.  I hate lentils (I thought), but the sample was free & I was hungry.  What a surprise!  This tastes a lot like really good chili!  It tastes like beef chili, though it doesn't have meat.  My husband likes it too, and he's not big on vegetarian meals.90 seconds in the microwave is perfect.  It doesn't seem like there are two servings in the pouch, but we poured it over slices of homemade bread, and it was very filling.  I'm looking forward to trying out more Tasty Bite flavors.  I hope they have a variety pack.
I'm a big fan of Tasty Bite and I've tried a lot of their offerings.  My absolute favorite is the Madras Lentils. (With or without rice) Than the Channa Masala and Punjab Eggplant. Beans Masala & Basmati Rice Ready Meal s also very good. The ones that I didn't like sooo much were the Jaipur Vegetables, Vegetable Korma, and Kashmir Spinach.  I really wanted to like the Bombay Potatoes but even over a generous helping of rice it's just too spicy, It has a good flavor but there's just too much heat in the mix. As a little side note, it looks like Tasty Bite is in the process of changing their packaging from envelopes in boxes to just envelopes. Good for the environment but WOW! the edges will cut you up. I'm still nursing a good size cut  from simply turning the package over to read ingredients. Hopefully they work on the design a bit more.
With my daughters decision to eat vegetarian, it has become a small struggle to find healthy, filling foods to stock in the pantry for her after school.We recently had the chance to sampleTasty Bite Entree, Madras Lentils, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)and I was very surprised at how good it was. Unlike my daughter I do not normally care for any type of Indian cuisine, but I liked this. It can be best described as a meatless chili, but with better flavor and texture than most vegetarian chili. It also had a nice level of heat to it.  Enough to notice, but not enough to be unpleasant.Serving suggestions were to use as a filling for tacos or over basmati rice. So far my daughter prefers to just eat it by itself.Now that we have found Tasty Bite brand products, my daughter is looking forward to trying out some others.  I thinkTasty Bite Entree, Kashmir Spinach, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)will probably be next.
I buy these all the time.It's GREAT for office food. I heat up a container ofAnnie Chun's Rice Express Sprouted Brown Rice, 6.3-Ounce Microwavable Bowls (Pack of 6), combine it with the contents of the Madras Lentils in a deep microwaveable bowl, give it 2 more minutes in the microwave and I've got a hot tasty filling filling, low fat high fiber meal (filling enough in fact that I often end up eating 1/2 and saving the rest for later). Both of these products require NO refrigeration so they are perfect for keeping around the office, at ~$5.50/meal if you eat it all at once, $2.75 if you split it between two meals.I also eat it at home.From a Weight watchers standpoint, the rice and the lentals add up to 10 points total, but like I said its filling enough for 2 meals.I will say, this is Indian food Lite, as in its processed food, and the spicing is mild. But it's very tasty
I bought this at Costco yesterday after trying a sample. This is something I will keep in my pantry. So good! Only 2 Weight Watchers points per serving. I don't like Indian food so I would have never tried this without sampling first. It just taste like a really good chili. My husband couldn't believe that there isn't any meat in it. I have friends on the Weight Watchers plan that also have to eat "gluten free" and I can't wait to tell them about this.
5 of us have tried this "Jaipur vegetables", and all 5 of us love it.  So full of flavor for something that comes out of a box.A single package is definitely enough to feed 2 people when served with rice, and I have stretched it to 3 for a smaller meal.  That makes this a really good value for something so easy and tasty.  Very highly recommended, I'm going to order more eventually myself.I have not tried any other Tatsy Bite item as of this writing so I can't compare to the others.  I might try the eggplant or spinach one next.Edit:  I have since tried many different Tasty Bite entrees and can tell you this is definitely the best of them all.Don't try the spinach one no matter what you read though trust me
I was recently introduced to Tasty Bite entrees and have stockpiled my office with a number of different varieties (so expect to see quite a few reviews).  I'm not one for instant meals but I've made an exception for Tasty Bite because I recognize all of the ingredients used, they're vegetarian (I'm not a vegetarian but I prefer to eat meat that's been just prepared), MSG and Preservative Free and the convenience can't be beat.  Since I eat these in the office when I haven't had the time to prepare anything else or go out for lunch, I mostly enjoy them as soups though I believe most are meant to be served on rice.  The Janipur Vegetables are very good and I love the Paneer Cheese cubes :).  I just wish that this dish were a little spicier to suit my taste.  I'll definitely be purchasing this one again.
This is the second Tasty Bite Indian entree I try and, just like the Madras Lentils, it's a winner. The taste is creamy, rich and flavorful, spicy but not too spicy. It's maybe a little more greasy than it needs to be, but the nutritional content breakdown reveals a fairly healthy entree.The portion is reasonable, but not large (fills up a small bowl).I wish Tasty Bite would make an effort and reduce the excessive packaging (each single portion is contained in a plasticized foil bag packaged inside a thick cardboard box), but as far as the food itself is concerned, this is a five star product. I can't wait to try the other Tasty Bite entrees now!
I have absolutely no experience with Indian food, but when I saw these entrees in a local discount store, I decided to try them, because I needed a quick dinner that night.I microwaved them for myself and my partner that night, and, hey, they were GOOD! We were both surprised that we liked the flavor of the cheese, peas, etc., considering that this was "prepared" food.This was a good introduction to Indian cuisine, and now I'm ready to try other flavors of this brand. After that, maybe an Indian restaurant? ;)
So I recently posted a review about the Tasy Bite Madras Lentils and how they were my favorite so far. And they were, until I tried this dish. DELICIOUS! Think of a  less tomato-y butter chicken-ish flavored sauce, but with vegetables and paneer instead. For a microwave dish, this meal is fantastic with naan or pita - which makes the perfect work lunch because no refrigeration is required. It's a little high in the fat content if you're like me and eat the whole packet (2 servings per packet), so I won't eat it every day, but I'll probably enjoy it once or twice a week. Definitely a new favorite.
Tasty Bite has become my least favorite brand of shelf-stable retort-packaged Indian meals. The Bombay Potatoes are a pleasant surprise after some of the other meals such as the syrupy Thai entrees.  (TheTasty Bite Entree, Punjab Eggplant, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)is another one I like.)The potatoes and chickpeas have retained a sufficient amount of texture.  The sauce is thin but has a pleasant spiciness and there is plenty of it, which I don't mind because it is pretty good, especially compared to some of the other ones I have tried.  You can add leftover potato, chickpeas, or even green beans to this meal and I like to serve it with brown rice and garnish with diced chili peppers.The entire package is supposed to be two servings but is realistically one. The total contents have 820mg of sodium, 6g of dietary fiber, 8g of fat, and 1g of saturated fat. The meal is vegan and is certified kosher.
I initially hesitated to buy any ready-to-eat product fearing that they might taste bad or how they could be preserved without preservatives.  But when shopping last week, I found it in the Indian cuisine aisle and decided to give it a try.  I just heated it and found it to be better tasting.  But you add lemon juice (enough to give it the sour tangy taste) and chopped cilantro.  I also added quarter teaspoon of chilli powder, rasam powder and salt accordingly to give it a fresh taste.  Try the above directions for a real good taste.
Vegan. All natural. Kosher. Chickpeas and potatoes in savory brown gravy. Reminds me of puri aloo (without the bread) from railway platforms or from street vendors across India, but higher quality and very hygienic. Convenient foil package. Heat & serve. Great with tortillas, pitas, puris, on toast, or over rice. Actually made in Maharastra, so its really the real thing.Tasty Bite Entr&eacute;e, Punjab Eggplant, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12),Tasty Bite Entr&eacute;e, Bengal Lentils, 10 Ounce Packet (Pack of 12), andTasty Bite Yellow Curry Vegetables & Jasmine Rice, 12-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)are also highly recommended.

Ha Ha, yes I realize the title of this review is very cheesy but it's how I feel about this product. When I sprinkle (or dump) it on my meals, I never feel the least bit guilty (as I sometimes do when I pour regular ol' salt on) because I know I am adding iodine to my food which is an essential nutrient we all need! This product tastes "seaweedy" so if you're not a fan, I'd go else where or use very small amounts to get your iodine fix... but I happen to love the taste so it works well! It tastes great on fish and Asian-esque type meals too, just experiment, it's worth it!
Glad to see it is available again.  I use this liberally in many foods, not much taste to it but it's health benefits are many.  I had my daughter in law taking it while pregnant with my grandson after reading that iodine can increase a child's IQ by 15 points.  I thought why not, a kid can use all the points he can get in today's world.  I'm also glad it comes from northern Atlantic waters since I feel that the Pacific waters are probably pretty 'nuclear' by now after the disaster at Fukushima.  Iodine was used for an unbelievable number of maladies in &#34;the old days&#34; and I think now the pharmaceutical companies, or prescription drugs, have replaced some pretty good remedies of old that were MUCH cheaper and probably better and with fewer side effects.
I got my Crunchie at Fresh & Easy market not Amazon. With that said, this chocolate bar was actually pretty good. It has a sort of light brittle type center, very airy, has a mild caramel x honey flavor to it. I didn't see a honey comb pattern in the middle, but maybe that was something I imagined seeing and didn't happen. The crunchy center is covered in a thin chocolate coating which was great, not too sweet. At Fresh & Easy this bar cost me about $1.50, and it wasn't so filing like a Snickers bar which is 1/2 the price. I realize this stuff is imported so it adds to the cost, but still I can't imagine this costing the manufacturer more then $.10 to make. There's just not much to it, unlike say a Snickers bar which has chocolate, nougat, caramel, and peanuts. So don't look to this as a snack that will fill you up, but a nice treat from the Brits.
First can I say that the seller of these candy bars is very thoughtful and they included and ice pack so the chocolates didn't melt in shipping. I grew up eating these candy bars in Africa so was delighted when I found them here at amazon. The honeycomb center is crunchy and melts in your mouth along with the milk chocolate coating. The only problem with these candy bars is they don't last long. They are that good and once others in your family find out about them they will disappear even more quickly. Maybe order 12!~The Rebecca Review
As someone else said- what are US manufacturers/distributers thinking????I believe See's does a similar luxury-cost product, but I doubt it's Crunchie-standard!When I was a child ( and no one was worried about lawsuits and kids handling lava-like fluids ) we made 'honeycomb' by boiling syrup and sugar then at the last minute adding bicarbonate of soda which whooshed it up and then you set it on parchment or greased pans quickly, then when set bashed it into pieces....if you had any you then dipped it in chocolate for the ultimate confection.Crunchie bars are the easier, safer, less-messy way to indulge in this tradition.
I love balsamic vinegar, and have tried several brands. I decided, since this one had such great reviews, to try it even though it is quite expensive.It blew my socks off!It is incredible balsamic vinegar. Actually perfect!When I dribbled it on a dinner salad I prepared, I felt like I was in Heaven.A few weeks after I purchased it from Amazon, I was visiting a local gourmet market and they had the same bottle  marked at twice the price!I cannot recommend this balsamic highly enough.Truly the best!
There are countless balsamic vinegars out there, making all kinds of claims about origin, method, aging, and so on, for all different prices.  How to choose?  Well, if you just want to make standard salad dressing, you can buy a decent balsamic vinegar for a third or maybe even quarter of the cost of this one.  But if you want one that you can use by itself in very small quantities, to dip bread in, or drizzle on a lamb chop, or maybe even on vanilla ice cream, and want a sensational taste experience that you just can't get from the products available in the supermarket, this is an excellent choice.  This is an intensely flavorful, sweet balsamic vinegar that in my opinion is as good or better than any available in this price range, regardless of what claims are made about how long it's aged or whatnot.
3/13/14Let me start with my initial review since I just received this and I will update later on.  First they are pretty big so i hope they will last a while which makes it a good deal. The power reminds me of konsyl or any other fiber supplement. The smell, well smelling just the can doesn't smell like anything to me.  I decided to heat up water and mix it in. It mixes in great without any issues--wit hot water.  The smell.... well it does gross me out a little. It smells like if you burnt hairs off your arm by accident mixed with cow crap.  Thats really the best way I can describe it. I'm willing to try different things and I will continue using twice/daily and see if anything changes. I'm hoping for joint pain to lessen.
I have been taking this for month, twice a day. Wondering if it was really helping, I stopped taking it for a week. Results are, yes it does help joint pain!  I would say I have 80- 90 percent relief. Being in the North East with one storm after another all winter, barometric pressure takes a toll on my joints , along with the bitter dampness being on the ocean. If I forget  even two doses, the joints let me know . The other plus is this Gelatin curbs my appetite!  I have been dropping lbs, back to my normal summer weight. I noticed I had more energy the first week.
I love this stuff.I've been using it in 2 ways:- I add this into my baking to make a more moist, cake-like texture- I use it with fresh juices to make real-juice jello from scratch.Wow.  Every time I use it, my body loves it.  Granted, this is a healing food for adrenal fatigue, which I have.  But each time I eat the gelatin / jello I prepared with this, my body craves more of it.For sure will re-order.  Highly recommended.
My mom has rheumatoid arthritis and so wanted to purchase this gelatin as a way of taking a gelatin supplement pleasantly. I purchased this for her, and ever since she got it, she has been using organic juices such as pomegranate or cherry juice and making the most amazing Jell-O jigglers with this stuff. I believe she found the recipe online for making Jell-O using gelatin, and even her first batch came out fantastic. The gelatin does not have any kind of strong flavor, so when used with a high quality juice it is truly a sublime and cooling snack. I would highly recommend this gelatin, which the website says is grass fed.
I purchased this brand due to recommendations from others in the paleo community.  I should be making bone broths for my source but just can't stomach the smell of it cooking at this time.  I am currently pregnant and want to make sure my body has plenty of the building blocks for healthy skin as my stomach grows.  I am also trying to heal my gut.  If I make soups I add some in and then any hot drinks get some added too.  I have been very pleased with this product so far and will order more when the time comes.
This product was recommended by many of my resources for adding gelatin into my diet. I tried using it in homemade gummies, but EEK, was that a strong, greasy, odd taste! I will not give up on it, but I think I'm going to use WAY LESS of this product to begin with until I get used to the texture of it, then I can begin to increase it. It wasn't as bad in homemade chicken soup or beef stew, though. So, I recommend going easy on it first until you get used to it.
I take gelatin for my skin and joints.  I have read it helps digestion also, really it is a super food in its own right.  I do add vitamin C, l lysine and proline, to make it work even better.  It does so much I hope to keep using it.  Right now I take two tablespoons a day, and if I weren't so lazy I would up it to four, but I make it in a tea and it does require preparation.  My daughter and I recommend things for our skin to each other and I told her about it and now she takes it too, she has gorgeous skin and wants to keep it that way
I bought this gelatin based on the reviews and to see if it would help with my psoriatic arthritis.  What I can tell you is that I saw an immediate reaction with my fingernails, which were somewhat yellowed from my illness and deeply ridged.  The ridges disappeared quite quickly, my nails got stronger, and the discoloration is growing out.  Crazy!  I'm seeing a return of thickness and body to my hair too.  My knees and hips, which are afflicted by my auto-immune disorder, feel better these days.It took me awhile to figure out the best way to take this stuff though.  To me it's really nasty.  But it seems to disappear into my morning green smoothie (as long as I drink it pretty quickly).  I have also made fruit jello with it and that worked well.
I used this with V8 fusion fruit juice and it made wonderful, healthy, yummy jello!  It was really easy...i followed the directions for the amount and put 1/4 of the juice in my pyrex pan and sprinkled the required gelatin on top and let it sit for a couple of minutes and stirred it in until dissolved, then I microwaved the remaining 3/4 juice until it was hot and poured it in the pyrex and stirred it in, it did not take long to dissolve...a couple of hours later I had very happy jello!I also love their hydrolyzed geatin, and use that in my smoothies :)
You read reviews and suggestions on products and I'm pretty sure that you cannot go wrong with Gelatin.  BUT, after using this a couple of months in a row, I have noticed a difference.  My hair is getting thicker, it was thinning out and my nails are strong.  They were getting to a certain length and then would break, they were fragile. Now they are thick and hard to trim! Lastly, I noticed that my knees do not hurt.  I dance a lot and one knee really hurt, now that is gone.  I take one tablespoon a day.  I cannot take it just with water but usually mix it with cold juice.
This makes the best jello I've ever had just really can't say enough about it.It's just something I use in everything and it really does make ur hair longer and stronger so happy.I lived in Germany for so long and while there I just loved the gelatin snacks and other treats I got.So ja I have been looking every where for good gelatin and recipes.So far I hit the mother load with this gelatin and some really good recipes from Wellness Mama's web site yay.But u can use it for hair, skin, stomach problems, and so much more.I like it as just a yummy snack. ^_^
I sent these as a holiday gift to someone, and they RAVED about them. The price was right, and I got the reaction I wanted. I also got to sample some myself when I came across them at a local warehouse store, and they are in fact super delicious. Messy, melty, extremely chocolatey and rich, but super delicious! I liked this product because it gives a lot of bang for the buck, which is always a plus when giving a present. As for the candy, they are smooth and creamy, but extremely chocolatey, so make sure whoever you buy them for is a true chocoholic!
At first I wasn't sure about ordering these, but decided to give it a try.  The weather here is getting warmer and I did not want a chocolate blob arriving, thankfully these are on prime and I was able to get them in 2 days. These arrived nicely packaged, there are 2 bags inside the box shown here. I was happy to see this is a nice amount of truffles for the price and they are pretty good.  Its hard to just eat one, or two, so thankfully there are 2 bags because in my house one bag already "walked off".  I have these ready when company comes to visit and for those occasions when I am craving chocolate.  The taste is of dark chocolate, and the consistency is like someone else said, a little oily when the truffle is all done.  Overall I do like these and so do my family members! I would recommend these to anyone who enjoys a piece of dark chocolate every now and then.
I thought I would get these truffles for a Christmas treat, I am so glad I did! They are spectacular! The chocolate is to die for, I couldn't stop eating them. Out of all the candy we had at Christmas time, my 3 boys enjoyed these the most. When their friends come over now I hear them asking for "those truffles. Do you guys have any more?" My kids don't eat a lot of sweets but they have commented several times to me on how good these truffles were. I will certainly buy them again as long as I can find them available to order. In fact, I am going to order a few boxes right now for Valentine's Day as gifts for my sons.
Ate one Truffette and it tasted terrible, ate a second to make sure that the first wasn't a fluke, and the second tasted even worse.  They have the sickening taste of moldy bitter sweet chocolate used in making chocolate fudge.  They are not sweet nor tasty in any sense of the word.  They leave a bad taste in my mouth and an unpleasant feeling in my stomache.  I will never again pay any attention to the reviews on Amazon.  How anyone could report that this awfull concoction is good or great is far beyond me.  I may have received a bad lot, but I doubt it.  Obviously, a number of reviewers of this product who rated it four or five stars would rate cow dung as delicious.  Buy a fifty cent candy bar at your local food store instead of purchasing this awful concoction, at least they taste sweet and don't leave you rushing to the frig for something to kill the taste of Chocmod Truffettes.
I'm a serious chocoholic and had received some chocolate truffles as a gift for Christmas. They were from Europe but nothing was labeled as to the brand name or company that made them. They were incredibly good. I found these truffles and decided to try them. What luck! They had the same, supple flavor that I was looking for. The cocoa powder on the outside starts the taste out a bit bitter, but as you bite into them, the sweetness takes over. OMG. Just don't look at the side panel of nutritional info. Five of these little truffles will dominate your daily intake of saturated fat. Yes, only five.
These truffles are delicious and a great value; even more with free shipping [with additional purchase]! Not being individually wrapped saves waste; and one...or two...etc., certainly isn't enough! I didn't realize that the chocolate was covered with cocoa powder [and would've preferred without-which should be in big print]; but, as they say,'that is neither here nor there'[and, admittedly, once I saw 'truffles' I was totally distracted and filled with anticipation. They arrived within the timespan given, in fine shape and as delicious as anticipated. Vive La France!  In my previous review re: Kirkland Chocolates where I pointed out the ridiculous rise in price [despite the extraordinary deliciousness of the product]; I noticed that the price has been reduced somewhat. But it is still high...going from $19.99 to $49.99 within a few months! I will keep an eye on this item; it being another exceptionally delicious treat, with variety and wonderful tastes, within.
I first bought Joseph's Maltitol to use for Jorge Cruise's vanilla ice cream last year and have found many uses besides--sweetening drinks, making delicious, decadent brownies and of course, the ice cream. I've made dozens of batches of ice cream, all with fantastic results. In fact, we prefer the maltitol-sweetened ice cream to all others including commercial premium brands.Jorge recommends limiting your consumption of alcohol sweeteners to 100 gms to avoid flatulence. I have not found this to be a problem with the ice cream whereas it has occurred with xylitol sweetened iced tea.Give it a try. Jorge's ice cream recipe is available online and only takes five minutes to make.
I have really enjoyed Hoisin sauce for years. There is a tremendous difference in the taste of various brands. Some have almost no 'Hoisin flavor' and some have a lot. Some are spicy and some not. To me this is non-spicy, which I like because I do not tolerate spicy (hot) foods. The 'Hoisin flavor' is mild. It tastes like sweet and sour sauce with some added 'Hoisin flavor'. I like it but wish the 'Hoisin flavor' was stronger.I first ordered the 3 smaller bottles and they arrived fine. 3 of the 6 larger bottles leaked in the box and made a big mess.
Just add this to your lo mein or other chinese recipe for authentic restaurant taste.  I use some soy, ground ginger, msg (yes I like the taste of it and my arms haven't dropped off yet) along with a little garlic and onion powder and of course some roasted sesame seed oil.  The starter mixture is the basis for quite a few fine chinese dishes and the amounts of each can be adjusted to suit your taste.  A few lo mein noodles, some shrimp or chicken or beef bits and you're quickly able to make a very tasty authentic lo mein.  I don't use this in my fried rice, though but it is good in stir fried vegies, etc.
Several weeks ago I discovered Izze fruit drinks starting with the Blackberry variety. It was so good I tried the Pomegranate. That was good too, so now I have a four-pack of the Clementine variety. It tastes like a weak orange soda with a good sharp tartness. I like it much better than the typical orange soda pop and it's made with 70% fruit juices and no added sugars. It's just like having a slightly carbonated fruit juice rather than darkly-colored sugar water. That's my kind of drink. Excellent.Gary Peterson
I've always liked hot sauces, salsas and spicey foods . Tabasco was my first choice in hot sauces originally and I still enjoy it now and then. But then I discovered several different wonderful brands of Louisiana Pepper sauces and I grew to like them better than Tabasco. Then one day when a store didn't have any Louisiana brands available, I picked up a small bottle of Frank's Red Hot Cayenne Pepper sauce as a temporary substitute. It was made in New Jersey. New Jersey? I thought all hot sauces of any quality came from the Gulf Coast States. This stuff just couldn't be any good!Well, surprise! This stuff is a very good hot sauce. In fact, it is better than most of the Louisiana hot sauces I have tried, and it is less expensive. It'll brighten up any number of dishes, especially things that come with tomato sauce. I use it along with ketchup anywhere I'd use ketchup alone. Delicious!Gary Peterson
When I was growing up, split pea soup was a uniform slurry of slow-cooked peas, flavored with a ham bone that would sometimes have small pieces of ham and/or carrots added in to serve. This is a different beast, but it's quite good. The base is that same split pea soup I know, but there's a lot of whole peas (not too mushy, which is nice), potatoes, carrots and chunks of ham. It really eats more like a stew than a pea soup, but it's flavorful and filling.The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is the quality of the meat. It's not bad, but it's not 5-stars, either. A bit tough and not enough fat content to be interesting, it's really just a textural variation in the stew.
This one is also a very tasty dish from Progresso.  And the chicken is the traditional one.  Lots of it.  My taster thinks there is a little too much herb (can't tell which one) it is.  I'm not an herb specialist.  But that's not a deal breaker.  And, of course, big, fresh dumplings are to die for.  Little ones are what you find in a can.  And these is it.  Nice quick meal when the mood for soup is in your head.  I like it.
As the first reviewer said, this soup disappeared from the markets I shop here in the east, so, per usual, I searched Amazon.  This soup is outstanding on its own, and for low carbers/diabetics, it is a special treat. I use this mostly as a sauce for chicken, pork chops, veggies. I treat it like mushroom soup for a sauce, thinning with cream or broth if needed, which normally I don't.  It has just a bit of spiciness to it, and for me it makes a big difference in ease of prep and added variety to what are sometimes bland dishes. There are few canned soups I like, but Progresso makes the ones I find palatable. The French Onion is especially delicious and good for saucing.
I'm Italian and didn't quite understand where the Wedding aspect of this soup was. Its a little too salty and tastes like spinach and fennel water. Which isn't horrible. It's just not something I'm going to crave.I think the Italian sausage could play more of a role and they should definitely increase the celery and add some mushrooms. Some rice wouldn't hurt. It's definitely missing some texture. The bits are all small and soft, this is a soup that needs the &#34;Rich and Hearty&#34; treatment.
I'm happy to patronize another company than Campbell's, who is fighting against estate taxes for themselves.At first I liked this soup a lot, but after a while I've gotten tired of it, and it's not as enjoyable. I don't really have any specific complaints - it seems pretty good for healthiness and quality.I pick out the bits I don't like - the red things and celery - but that's not a ding on the soup.Overall it's a nice soup, pretty good taste, rice and carrots go well with the chicken. Good, just not crazy about it.
I have been buying Progresso's soups off and on for quite a few years and have found many of them to be a bit "under the spice radar," but this one is quite good. Don't think you're going to get a restaurant quality soup, but as the wife of an Italian, this one isn't "too bad," I've been told. I do have to doctor it up quite a bit with seasonings, but other than dumping out a TON of unnecessary broth, it's quite a companion to your favorite sandwich. Even my 10-year-old requests that I add my spices to it - it's just too bland! Other than that, I do suggest you buy it but with the knowledge that you'll have to add your own special touches.
This is one of my favorite lunch staples, and something that I try to keep stocked in my food pantry at all times. (I also love the steak and noodles variety.) It's much, much better than the original version of Cambell's chicken noodle soup,  and and for the price makes for a tasty, low-cal, and filling lunch (or even dinner). I'll doctor it up sometime by adding a little lemon juice, fat-free sour cream, or mozzarella or parmesan cheese. Add a few crackers, and it's a substantial meal. I am particularly happy that this is available through Amazon Prime, since I live on a bridge-less island and have to haul my groceries over on a ferry. Now, periodically a box of this soup is delivered to my cottage porch by the island UPS lady...and with no shipping fee!...giving me a constant supply on hand.
And the "herb dumplings" look more like little cat turds than anything else.This is not chicken and dumplings, its soup. If you are going to try this havea can of Wondra on hand cause this is nothing but chicken broth and it demandsa cube of bouillon as well. The dumplings are a joke, and if you are thinkingyou are getting a can of real chicken and dumplings you will be very disappointed.Progesso has gone the way of most US corporations, cutting corners and misleadingproduct titles, and this is not their only product that fails in that category,stay away from the Chicken and Sausage "Gumbo" too. LOL
This chicken noodle soup has a nice flavorful stock and good sized chunks of carrot, cellary and the chicken. The noodles do a great job of retaining the stock for flavorful bites much better than the classic flat noodles.The can is a good size and a meal unto itself and is easily split into two portions. If you do decide to eat the entire can though it will hit you for 68% of your daily sodium; though that is a common pitfall of a good chicken stock and cutting the sodium cuts the flavor.
I really enjoy this soup. It is hearty and very filling and it tastes great, nice and spicy, but not so hot it is overwhelming. The blend of chicken, corn and beans in a thick gravy is a wonderful mix of flavors and texture. It's nice any time of year, but especially good in the fall and winter.This is the ingredient list: Chicken Broth, Cooked White Chicken Meat, Corn, Tomatoes, Rice, Green Sweet Peppers, Black Beans. Contains less than 1.5% of: Water, Dried Corn, Tomato Paste, Modified Food Starch, Salt, Chicken Fat, Corn Protein (hydrolyzed), Onion, Potassium Chloride, Yeast Extract, Cilantro, Sugar, Onion Powder, Garlic Powder, Spice, Soy Protein Isolate, Chili Pepper*, Natural Flavor, Sodium Phosphate, Maltodextrin, Calcium Chloride, Citric Acid.There are two servings per can of one cup each, at 110 calories per cup.
Hey Progresso !!Is there a ham crisis ?!?!I noticed that you guys were VERY chinzy on the ham in your split pea soup. The 'chunks' were small and REALLY dried out - and lacking flavor.Whoever was / is the mastermind behind this new so-called recipe should be ashamed. Your OTHER stuff is great, but this 'split pea with ham' is an embarrassment to your good name....Progresso - You've spent DECADES building a solid reputation.Why blow it for a few lousy pieces of HAM - and a few idiots who clearly have no idea how to make YOUR SOUP !!
There is no question that Progresso has made some excellent and tasty soups for all to enjoy. That has been the case with their chicken soups over the years. But this one isn't bad, but could have been better. The Progresso Chicken & Orzo with Lemon tastes good, with a lot of orzo pasta in it, and tasty pieces of chicken. Yet, my only gripe with the soup is that I honestly wish that there could have been a bit more lemon zest right into each and every bite I could taste from the soup. Still, it is a nice twist for a longtime favorite lover of soups. I do hope though that Progresso can improve the taste of this one though for anyone who loves a bit of a twist into the classic Chicken Soup.Price: B-Taste: BOverall: B-
This has become one of our family's favorite soups.  When the weather is cold we eat a lot of soup, so we have added this to our monthly subscription.  It is a good cheese flavor, mildly spicy, with some vegetables in it, and with nice chunks of white-meat chicken.  My kids are always glad to see it.  If you're not familiar with the Progresso brand you might want to know that it is not a condensed soup:  you don't add anything; it's heat-and-eat.  We use two cans to feed four people, with some bread and fruit on the side.
This is a family favorite. One thing that we like to do is to cook up some additional barley and add it to the soup, to give even more &#34;pop&#34; to the barley taste.The taste is hearty, the soup thick. The downside? Like many canned goods, there is way too much sodium (29% of the daily value). On the positive side, bad fat and cholesterol are low. Some dietary fiber. . .Overall, a good taste.In the end, despite some issues, my family enjoys a meal based on this product.
I was hoping for larger dumplings, I admit, but this was an ok substitute. While not particularly delicious, I didn't find anything wrong with it.I'm torn between giving this a three and a four... to me, a four is something I'll order again because it's a little bit better than average, while a three is just average, and not something I'd really want to buy again. Since this is unremarkable, I'm going with a three, but if you particularly love soup or something, it is not a bad product. Just not noteworthy.
Sometimes we are just looking for a quick and easy meal that is warm but fast. The other day our grandson was over for lunch and we cooked up some chunks of chicken breast and then made this Fettuccine Alfredo. He wanted something warm and we all enjoyed it. We also baked some fresh biscuits and it made a good meal.For a fast meal that is easy to make it tastes pretty good and it sure beats the old lunch meat sandwich for lunch. We all liked it and I recommend it to you.I posted a couple of photos for your review.
It's Hamburger Helper.  What can you say?  You either like it or you don't.  We do.  It's not exactly like homemade, but for a quick meal when you're in a hurry, it's okay.  The Hamburger Helper meal sizes are continuing to shrink.  These are a measly 6.6 ounces; about enough for one hungry person or two mildly hungry ones. I add a few extras--about 4 ounces of dry spaghetti noodles, a cup of additional water, some tomatoes and/or other veggies, to make a bigger meal.  Also, I quite often use ground Italian sausage, instead of hamburger, very tasty!  I look for these meals on sale, because at full price, they are just too expensive for what you get.  Hope this helps!
I bought this product to take camping with us this past summer because I thought it would be quick and easy and I wouldn't have to take along a bunch other things than normally go into my spaghetti. It was a big hit with the whole family and no one could believe it was Hamburger Helper. It isn't gourmet, but it serves its purpose. It is easy, tasty, and quick to fix. Just the thing when cooking is not tops on the agenda, but you still gotta feed the hungry horde.
I bought a bunch of HH boxes at the local market as they were on sale for 4 for $5 and Chili Cheese was one of the varieties I picked. My family usually prefers to just stick to either Beef Pasta or Lasagna, but I thought the sale would be a good chance to try new ones.The Chili Cheese takes mostly milk, with 2 full cups called for and only 2/3 cup water. To be honest it smelled pretty awful while it was simmering and I wasn't really looking forward to eating it. However, it wasn't too bad. The main thing was that the kids absolutely loved it, with both of them asking for seconds and my son requesting the leftovers for home lunch the next day.I'd buy it again, but probably won't cook it as often as our other favorites.
This flavor of Hamburger Helper is similar to the Stroganoff flavored one without the sour cream in it.  This is a plain dish that you can add seasonings or spices to, or just serve it with sour cream and a bottle of Louisiana hot sauce (which covers a multitude of cooking sins).  Anyway, this is quick for a family on the run when you want to eat together but need something quick.  Prepare with hamburger or ground turkey, serve with a salad or vegetable and reconnect at home.  With Amazon Prime and/or an autoship scheduled delivery of this, it is the same price or less than any grocery store.  Another plus for families is that these usually have Box Tops for Education on them too.
I love this stuff! Its real easy to prepare in the skillet. Its great if you have kids or just as a meal by yourself. If you want, you can substitute ground beef for ground turkey, or even a vegetarian substitute and it still tastes good. I eat this stuff several times per week. If you've never tried it, you dont know what you are missing. This is one of my most favorite foods. Sure, it has a lot of sodium, but it is meant to be a main course and it has lots of protein in it with the meat. I prefer adding about half a pound of meat instead of a pound like it says, but you can decide for yourself.
There was a younger, stronger time when frowns appeared at the sight of HH, but the products have gained much more respect in the golden years so much so that my spouse can help w/cooking!  Be beef, pork, ham, chicken or tuna,or just plain Alfredo, the basic contents of these products can be prepared to taste gourmet w/just a FEW added ingredients one most likely has on hand for any given meal!  For instance, Sloppy Joes w/sauteed onions and peppers served over toast points w/a salad and a fruit makes for a completely balanced meal.  Have stockpiled cases for emergencies in my safe room, as well as for daily use!
I agree with the other reviewers that say you need to like the stovetop Hamburger Helper in order to like this.  Now if you do and if you're like me and you have a tendency of eating the WHOLE pan in a frighteningly short amount of time, these are the perfect thing for you.  They're delicious!!!  High in sodium (but what quick microwavable meal isn't?), but as long as these aren't the only thing you're eating all day, I doubt you'll have an issue with it. I personally love these little packets and I am so glad to find that Amazon still stocks them because none of my local stores do anymore.
This beef stroganoff mix is not bad--just bland, not a particularly tasty use of a pound of ground beef and a container of fresh mushrooms.  I thought it was worth trying because it's cheap and it's available in my local grocery stores. The stroganoff mix I'm comparing it to, Annie's Homegrown Organic, is less convenient for me; I have to order in bulk from Amazon or stock up when out of town.  And the Annie's mix is a bit more than twice as expensive.  Whether a box meal is organic isn't important to me, so I'm not taking that into account.  But considering flavor vs. convenience and cost, I think that the Annie's mix is the better value.  Of course, taste is a personal thing--this is just my view.  Here is the link for the Annie's mix:Annie's Homegrown Organic Beef Stroganoff Skillet Meal, 6.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)
I like having Betty Crocker Helper mixes in the pantry. They come in really handy on grocery shopping day. Inevitably there will be something that needs to be used up fast to make room for the newer product in the fridge. Usually it's the last of the milk. Sometimes it's the last stick of butter, or the last packet of cheese. Even leftover meat and vegetables can go in there. There is always something. Betty Crocker pasta meals are awesome for making those odds and ends disappear. The Helpers kind of need doctoring anyway, so the odds and ends wind up well used, and the Helpers are so cheap it makes sense to use them as a recipe starter. The Stroganoff is one of my favorites, partly because I like Stroganoff but also because it's an easy way to get rid of the last of the sour cream. Truthfully, all of the Helpers are great for using up odds and ends, but I'm nostalgically fond of the beef ones.
The local stores obviously think they're saving shelf space by only stocking this 'enchilada box mix' in the product line.Well, it DOES taste different than it's chicken counterpart--and this is not a good thing.If you're looking for a fritoey-pie flavor, this would be the product to purchase. It could be prepared with ground turkey or veggie meat crumbles.But I can't recomend utilizing seafood because of the 'heavier' flavor throughout the mix. I've prepared it several times and I just have problems detecting the cheese taste which is supposed to be throughout. I got more of a 'chili' taste. both upon my first and second bites.The product is edible. But it's not one of the enjoyable dishes. And I did not end up feeling like I was eating a delicious dish which I'd want to eat again--or serve to others. Save your money.
As a Mom to 3 kids I'm not a fan of these quick meals really.  BUT on the other hand as an after school snack or a night time quick snack it's OK for the kids.  I think the smell is repulsive and the thought of eating dehydrated meat is NASTY but my boys LOVE this junk.  They eat it right up.  That's kids for you though, anything junky, hahaha.  If you're kids eat things like mac n cheese or hamburger helper in the skillet they will like this, it's just not for me personally.
I love chex mix. Its got more variety going for it than plain chips, and you can easily snack on it in the car, home, or quietly in an office meeting.The BOLD flavor of chex mix is in my top 3 favorites. On the bag it has a bottle of worcestershire, onions and garlic as the flavor profile, I can definitely taste those in this. Its not supposed to be so bold that you cannot enjoy the vehicle the flavors on are on like the pretzel, or chex, or those pumpernickel amazingness.I like to MIX my chex mix together. I combine BOLD with theChex Mix Chex Snack Mix - Honey Nut, 8.75-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)you should really try it, its delicious!
Anyone remember the older cheddar Chex Mix? It had peanuts, corn chex, wheat chex, round pretzels, and window pretzels. I didn't particularly care for the peanuts, but as a whole, that flavor was really cheesy and good! I remember that it leaves lots of orange cheese powder on your finger.Now, the grocery stores around only carry this newer Cheddar flavor, which has corn chex, wheat chex, twist pretzels, round pretzels, and a cheesy triangle. But I don't think the flavor tastes as good as the old one. Anyone still see the old one in regonal grocery stores? What do you all think about the old vs. new Chex Mix cheddar?They are still good, it is just not the same.  They just don't make bears like they used to.  The crackers are just too sweet.
The product itself was just fair.But the worst part of this order the condition that it came in.  All six bags were terribly broken up.  Each bag had very little chex pieces left in them because of poor shipping!  I purchased another item along with this one and who ever packaged this put a box in the middle of a shipping box and put the chex mix on the sides (as if they were packaging cushions)!  Who does Amazon have working in their shipping department?  Obviously not a lot of common sense.  I will not buy this product again.. or any other "fragile" items!
Wow, what a mixture of great tasting things.  Caramel popcorn and caramel coated Chex with M&Ms; and Chex and pretzels sprinkled with chocolate power.  The only bad thing about it is that you can't stop with just a little bit of it because it is so good.  We had some today while watching football games and this is one great combination of flavors.This is a great snack that tastes great and has 50% less fat than chips and a  cup serving contains 130 calories and 8 grams of sugar but only 5 grams of fat.  This is a good product and I recommend it to you.
Chex Mix Bold is tasty, although the mix differs from the package shown. I like it better than the old version, as I found the round crackers in the old version rather bland. The cereal is crispy, the rye crisps crunchy and the flavor is just the right bold for me (there's a similar store brand version of this at Food Lion and it is way too oniony for my taste buds!). My only complaint about the new Chex Mix Bold is that the pretzels aren't really crispy and sometimes taste on the stale side, ruining an otherwise perfect snack food!
This is a great snack for watching a late movie, or in the middle of the afternoon.  You can keep this at your desk, or take with you in the car.  I take it to festivals, because I can eat in the booth and don't have to worry about greasy hands when a customer comes by, and I don't have a mouthful of dry crackers either.  It's small pieces makes it easy to chew and swallow, but it has so many different items that it has a great flavor.  Good for keeping in your desk for a late afternoon snack at work.  So many different flavors you don't get tired of it.  Not overly salty for those like me that have to watch your salt intake.
I've tried just about every flavor of suddenly salad and the creamy parmesan is by far my favorite.  There's only one problem with it, the seasoning mix is way too strong.  It suggests you add chopped tomato in it, but I've experimented and found an absolute delight by turning it into an actual salad.  Another reviewer suggested doubling the pasta and that definitely works, but I add a head of chopped romaine lettuce, along with tomato and fresh parmesan and my friends and family cannot get enough of it.With as much seasoning as it makes, I can also see chicken doing rather well.  I would definitely recommend, just not on it's own, and it's fun to experiment with.
We like the taste of Caesar salad, and this one is a big hit.  When we are in a hurry and don't have time to make everything from scratch, it is convenient to make something tasty like Suddenly Caesar Salad.  Usually we add olive oil instead of vegetable oil.There's a suggestion on the box for creamy Caesar salad. It calls for mayonnaise and milk.Sometimes we add some romaine and chicken.  It's also good with crawfish tails, leftover broiled salmon, or shrimp.
this is by far our favorite flavor (BACON!!) of these pasta salads. we get this through the amazon subscribe and save. I noticed that when grocery shopping, a lot of times this flavor would be sold out at the grocery store.it may seem like a lot, but one case every six months or so is not bad.  that is about twice a month. and buying in bulk like this, we just put it on the top shelf in the pantry and always have a quick &#34;go to&#34; side dish.we like to add chopped up radishes, celery, and onions to this mix.we did see a recipie of adding cooked chicken, and then cooling to make a good &#34;hot weather&#34; meal.
I order this product about every 2 months, I usually order the Rich Milk Chocolate (pack of 3) 27.7 oz canister. I use the mix in my coffee every morning and my kids enjoy a cup every evening when it is cold outside. It's pretty hard to find it in the canisters where I live and I prefer that to the packets that are sold, so this is a good buy for me. The product always arrives intact, no dents or spilled cocoa in the box. I don't know if I would try the other flavors since I like the Rich Milk Chocolate one so far.
I do not like this for its intended purpose as a hot chocolate drink. To my taste buds, this does not taste rich and chocolate-y despite its name of "Double Chocolate Meltdown".But - I add it every day to my morning coffee and for that purpose, it is the best hot chocolate powder around. I've tried many different brands and chocolate flavors but nothing comes close to putting this one in my coffee. It creates the perfect balance between hot chocolate and coffee, and I even make sure to take it with me when going on vacation. Love it for that!
Every morning, I have hot chocolate mixed with instant coffee and some cinnamon. This is a great choice because it is only 25 calories a packet, with 30% of your daily calcium requirement. I tried the similar product by Swiss Miss, but it doesn't dissolve fully like this one does, it leaves big clumps on the side of the cup and sediment on the bottom so I was very happy to go back to this one, even though it's more expensive, because it dissolves very well and has a great taste.It's great that Amazon carries this by the case. It's cheaper than buying it at my local grocery here in California, however, when I lived in New England it was cheaper at the local store. I was thinking the only thing that would make it better would be if they sold it in cannisters so I wouldn't have to deal with all these little packets and boxes, and I just noticed today that Amazon HAS THIS in cannisters now. Woohoo!
I was so happy when I found this. It is the best brand of no fat hot chocolate around. So finding it in bulk was surprising since I only see the 8 individual pack variety in grocery store. Getting it in bulk has made me experimental with it. For example, I have even tried it in plain milk to make chocolate milk, and it works pretty well, too. I've also put a ready made hot one in the freezer to have a cold chocolate. At 20 calories a serving, this can't be beat for value both monetarily and caloric-ally.
I usually buy Nestle's Hot Cocoa Mix in the Milk Chocolate flavor.This time, I decided to try the Dark Chocolate flavor which we'venever had before.  My husband loves dark chocolate in all its forms,but I never really cared for it.  Well, I still don't.  This is aflavorful hot cocoa, but I think it's much sweeter than the MilkChocolate flavor yet not as chocolate-y; not as creamy.  This flavoris OK and the price was good at Amazon so we'll use it up but I'llgo back to the Milk Chocolate flavor the next time I order.By the way, we've tried every popular brand of hot cocoa mix andNestle's wins, there's no contest.  After all, as they say,"Nestle's makes the very best - chocolate".
This product is super convenient, instead of having to eat an MRE for midnight chow I can cook one of these little babiesand i am good to go. Enough to fill you up and keep you satisfied for a few hours when the only thing to look forward to isanother MRE for breakfast.  These are a little salty and if you don't stir it properly and add the warm water the dried saucesticks to the bottom or stays dry inside the pasta leaving it a bit crunch in some spots and a little weird tasting from gettingtoo much of the dry stuff in another.  It would be fantastic with a little grilled chicken thrown in but that is hard to come by unless I buy the chicken in a packet which would make this even saltier.  3 1/2 for flavor and 4 1/2 for being handy. Recommending having at least 1 1/2 bottle of water to have to drink while eating.  The price isn't too bad either
Betty Crocker's Pasta Alfredo style Bowl Appetit! is a quickly-prepared, tasty, nicely textured and inexpensive snack, even alone by itself. It's even better with a chunk of cheese melted into it and a salad or a few veggies on the side. The package claims "No Preservatives or Artificial Flavors," so I'll trust that info. However, for most contemporary tastes it may be a tad salty. On the other hand, though I'm not writing a separate review, the Herb Chicken Vegetable Rice does not make it at all, but has a not very pleasing texture and a totally yuck, salty, artificial flavor. You win some and you lose a lot, but I'd definitely advise stocking up on a supply of Pasta Alfredo.
While I am sure this is bad for you, it is one of my favorite comfort foods, mostly because it is easy to make and has a great flavor.I do not care for the other flavors of Bowl Appetit because I do not find them half as flavorful as this one.  This is really high in salt (50 pct of your daily intake) so better go light on salty items on days you eat it.All you need to make it is water, a utensil for stirring, and a microwave.  Can't get much easier than that!
I keep these in a shelf on my desk for an easy hot lunch at work. Following the package directions always turns out right for me. (add water, heat for four minutes)Actually a decent amount of broccoli, but you could make it healthier by adding even more. I know it's a convenience food, but even so, I find it a bit too salty. I'm always thirsty after eating it. But, it's yummy and my other coworkers always ask what I've made because it smells good, too.
Pasta Alfredo? Hardly. They should have called it "Pasta Not So Alfredo".My only wish is that I could rate it -1 star.It came in a pack of 12. I've got 11 that I don't want.After following directions to the letter, I ate about half, and threw the rest out.It made my stomach feel as if I had swallowed a stone.In the past, I have learned that you shouldn't expect super great taste out ofsuch types of products, however, very few have been THIS horrible. It wasabsolutely disgusting.I hate wasting food, even if it is this bad. I've decided I'm going to donate theother 11 packages to the local food pantry. Maybe someone else will enjoy this?
I've had good luck with Lipton - aka Knorr - side dishes.Most are a bit bland but none have had any "off" tastes. That is quite an accomplishment for any prepared food. I have tried EVERY Lipton/Knorr side dish. None are bad nor are any stunning!This is one of my favorites. Add a healthy dose of cracked pepper after cooking and it really is tasty.It cooks fast, is very simple to prepare and you have a good sized SIDE dish for TWO - or a MEAL FOR ONE - or a small helping for FOUR.My three star rating may be a bit generous for a processed food. Still - I'd recommend this Lipton dish along with their Teriyaki Rice and their Stroganoff. These three are my favorites.
This is one of my "go to" convenience foods, for those days when I'm under the weather, or just too busy to want to spend much time figuring out what to make for dinner (I'm single, so ... ).Anyway, I use a package of this, a 9-oz can of chicken white meat chunks, and about 2/3 C of frozen peas to make a filling, FAST, tasty meal that isn't *too* out of line.  Once it's cooked, I put half of it aside for another meal, and eat the other half.  Add a quick fresh salad, and I've got a really decent meal, plus another meal for the next day.  Economical, fast, convenient.I've tried some of the other "Pasta Sides" varieties, but the Alfredo is the best as far as I'm concerned.  Price here is decent, too, but keep an eye on it: it can vary wildly sometimes.
Mmmmmmmm ... Pasta Sides! Now this is what my mother called "stick-to-your-ribs" food. It's filling and delicious!I enjoy all the Sides, but this Stroganoff with "fettuccine in sour cream and mushroom sauce flecked with parsley" is my favorite, with Alfredo/Broccoli running a close second.Served with a fresh garden salad and a cup of green tea ... Ah-hhh a quick, healthy feast ... fit for a Queen ... or even a writer. ;-)The entire meal, including salad prep, takes less than fifteen minutes.  What could be easier? Now dig in, kids, and enjoy ... I wouldn't steer you wrong.Reviewed by: Betty Dravis, 2008author of 1106 Grand Boulevard
For a little over $1.00 this pouch can provide me with a whole meal as it tastes that good. I live alone and find it difficult to cook for myself. Knorr/Lipton makes numerous flavors of these &#34;side dishes&#34; that are so easy to prepare. Just pour dry contents of pouch into 2 quart round bowl, add 2 1/4 cups water and 2 tablespoons salad oil, microwave on high 12-13 minutes and that's it!  I enjoy these a couple of times each week and have a nice variety from which to select. Because the contents are dry the product is easy to store and they last a long time.
i loooove the knorr sides!i like to "play" with them a bit and make them even better.what i do with this flavor is that i saute garlic and some chopped chili peppers(dry coarse ground would be fine too) in some OLIVE oil,and then add the rice mix.then i add to the rice  2 1\4 cup water and half a teaspoon of paprika and then i let it boil.when it does boil i cover it(with a pot cover and a small kitchen towel under the cover) and cook it on the LOWEST heat on my stove top for 10 mins........then open and stir the rice and quickly seal the pot again and cock for another 10 mins(total of 20 mins).shut off the heat of the stove top and let it stand for 10 mins.open the cover and stir the rice and enjoy! :-))i love to add some tabasco sauce on mine when i eat this.i love these soo much! :-)
As others have stated, these have more noodle in them than rice now. It's not bad if you are making it as a side once in a while. I bought this package to make frozen burritos and the noodle addition changes the texture quite a bit. Now it's not as firm of a mixture and wouldn't go well inside of tortillas.I ended up adding extra beans and shredded chicken, then we just ate it like that. I'll likely do similar things to use up the rest of this box and not order again. I can easily make red beans and rice in my rice cooker. This was a purchase of convenience for not having to do as much work with seasonings and whatnot. But I am disappointed in the texture of the new formula. I kept 3 stars because the flavor is still good and the remaining packages can be used as sides.
So quick and easy to make in a hurry. It has plenty of protein and tastes pretty good. It's a step above Mac-n-Cheese as it has a bit of texture and is more al-dente than slimy mac-n-cheese. The dehydrated broccoli softens up nicely and ads a bit of flavor. It's really difficult to keep the dairy in it from curdling during the cooking process though, and it often comes out grainy. If you monitor it, you can probably adjust the heat better and stir to avoid the curdling, but then it wouldn't be as convenient. Anyway, I often eat a bag as a meal when I'm feeling lazy and it's satisfying enough; I couldn't do it two days in a row though.
I live alone and find it's difficult to cook just for myself economically. For just over $1.00 this makes a quick, tasty satisfying meal for me. In a 2 quart microwave safe bowl, pour the dry contents along with 2 1/4 cups of water and 2 tablespoons of salad oil. Place bowl in microwave 12 minutes and that's it! Really nice Cajun type spicey flavor. Of course, it's also good as a side dish for 2 big appetites. Knorr/Lipton makes numerous flavors and they are all as easy to make as this one is. Plus, being a dry product in a foil-lined pouch they are easy to store and keep very well.
The Knorr/Lipton Cajun Sides Red Beans and Rice is a yummy dish I could eat it a few times a week... BUT I can eatRice a Roni Red Beans & Rice, 5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)EVERYDAY Y'ALL!!!  Knorr's/Lipton version is milder in flavor cooks faster and can handle an array of customizations like kielbasa, green peppers or sauteed ground beef/turkey and onions while the Rice a Roni version is closest to the homemade flavors in my in-laws recipe and the add-ins need to settle into the original powerful flavors rather than try to enhance them UNLESS it's Tabasco Sauce (Cajun Ketchup).
I absolutely do not get why anyone would make red beans and rice from this package instead of from scratch. It is just as easy to make your own. Read the ingredients list on this--what is some of that stuff?The home made version tastes so much better. You just take a cup of long grain rice, add two and a quarter cups of water, a quarter teaspoon of salt, 1 tablespoon of cayenne pepper, stir until combined, bring all this to a boil over medium heat stirring once then turn heat down to low and simmer for 20 minutes.While it is simmering, cut up a polish kielbasa sausage and heat it in a pan with a couple of tablespoons of sizzling hot saved bacon grease or olive oil or peanut oil or whatever you like. When the rice is done simmering, add the sausage and two cans of well rinsed kidney beans. Stir it all and cover the lid over it for a couple minutes to let it rest.
howdy y'all,this is pretty good. i find it a tad more heavy and starchy than i really care for, but it's enjoyable - especially if one adds some grilled sausage to it.for me, at least, zatarain's red beans and rice is better. this ...Zatarain's New Orleans Style Red Beans & Rice, 8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)it's a bit moister when cooked in the microwave [per the instructions, it's cooked covered instead of uncovered], i like the red beans better than the ones in the lipton mix, it seems to be less heavy & starchy AND the spice is _much_ tastier to me.take care,lee
I've been eating Knorr (Lipton) noodles for about 15 years now. They are simple to make, inexpensive, and tasty. This particular variety is rather lacking in the flavor department. As far as all the Knorr varieties go, this is near the bottom of my list. I will probably not be buying this one again. This flavor, along with the other two new flavors (Bacon Cheddar and Scampi) are rather disappointing. I would have expected more from Knorr. The discontinued Beef Lo Mein Asian side from Knorr was much, much better than this.
I've eaten these rice sides for probably 10 years or more now, and this Cheddar Broccoli variety used to be my favorite.  Unfortunately, a while back, Knorr bought out the Lipton line of rice products and subsequently proceeded to cut costs in any way possible to make more money.  This has unfortunately resulted in the previously quite cheesy rice dish being reduced to a shadow of its former self.  I bought a box of these because I hadn't had them in a while, and because the Chicken and Broccoli variety still holds up well enough only to discover that the new mix results in a very wet cheese sauce (after cooking in the microwave according to the package directions) that is considerably less cheesy than one would expect.  Eventually enough of the sauce will evaporate/soak into the rice & pasta mixture to increase the flavor a bit, but I can't recommend it anymore.  It's become thoroughly average in every respect.
I LOVE rice dishes including many of this brands (Knorr) offerings.I love the taco rice and the teriyaki rice dishes are my favorites.I like Brocolli cheese soup and I thought &#34;THIS IS GOING TO BE GREAT!&#34;BOY WAS I WRONG. this was extremely bland. Not much flavor at all. This lookedAnd tasted like plain rice and vermicelli with tiny little bits of broccoli in it.There was no taste of cheese nor the color of cheddar of cheese about it.If you like broccoli cheddar keep looking because THIS ISN'T IT!
I love this stuff. I eat it alone, mixed with some fresh veggies or as a side dish. I love the flavor. Having it by itself, with some fresh veggies mixed in, it's only 650 calories [if you use butter or margarine]. I don't add butter or margarine and it's only 575 calories. That's really not bad for a meal. It has no trans-fats and it microwaves in 10-12 minutes.Although, I prefer when they sell it with a coupon deal or just at a lower cost.My only problem with this product is that it's made/distributed by Unilever and they test their [non-food] products on animals. Normally I would not buy anything made/distributed by Unilever, but I've been eating these for over twenty years, since they were just "Lipton Sides" and haven't broken myself of the habit yet. Eventually, I will.
I am a big fan of Knorr broth and sauce mixes and use them frequently not only because of their great flavors, but also their lower sodium content.  So I decided to give the Mushroom Rice Sides and the Asian Chicken Fried Rice Sides a try.  What a huge disappointment!  Not only are they sticky and gummy texture-wise, they are virtually tasteless.  Could not detect any mushroom flavor at all.  Tried both the stove top and microwave directions, and got the same poor results.  Then tried adding broth mix, various herbs, onions, etc., all to no avail.  The remaining nine packages of each of these are packed up for delivery to the local Food Bank.
This is good to have in stock when you need food but really don't want to make a big deal out of making food. I liked the taste of this stuff. But taste is a subjective thing, so what I like you may not. I would get some higher priced versions at your local store and make sure you like the taste. Food has a way of exciting or terrorizing ones taste buds. But at this price, if you like the taste it can not be beat as a source of sustenance. Which after all is the point to eating.
I really love these ostrim sticks - they taste like pleasant beef jerky and are in handy stick packages, and have a nice spicy flavor with a bite to it. They are nice and lean, which i like over actual beef jerky.Word to the wise, however; do not open these before you plan to eat them (or eat only half and try to save the rest for later). I guess once they touch the air, they start to change taste and eventually will mold, which I found out the hard way.
I bought the Ostrim with a little apprehension never having eaten any Ostrich meat.  After I had my first bite I KNEW I would be ordering more!  This is one of the best beef sticks (ok beef and Ostrich) that I have tasted, not only that it is very low calorie and high protein (which helps you feel full longer) and is all natural.  I'm not even half down with my first order and I already ordered a second batch.  This is just really good stuff, if you like beef jerky and beef sticks try this and you'll probably like it.  When you eat it the stick has a snap to it, tastes clean, not oily / greasy or fatty.  You taste just meat and before you know it you've eaten the whole thing and are thing about another.
I like to try new things, but I must say, I wasn't so sure about ostrich.  But, I am always looking for a high protein snack that fits into a carbohydrate-counting diabetic meal plan & snacks.  These really taste good !  They don't have any funky 'what the heck?' flavors at all- just a lean smoked meat stick that is low fat, a good source of potassium, and low-carb/high protein.  I can see ordering these again !  Think of these as a healthy Slim Jim type snack.Nutritional info (per stick- and they're hefty- roughly 3/4 inch diameter x 7 inches long)Calories -  80Fat- 1.5 gmsCarbs-  2 gmsProtein- 14 gmsPotassium- 590 mgSodium- 300 mgCholesterol- 25 mg (LOW !!)
I ordered these on May 21 and they turned out old with a bad aftertaste, however I order another batch around mid June and they taste totally fresh and great.I would really appreciate a refund on the order that tasted old and had an aftertaste, or be offered a fresh batch of the product, such would dictate good customer service.Update:I've contacted Amazon on the specific order of this item that tasted old and had an aftertaste, I've been reimbursed for that specific order right away. That's the Amazon customer service I've grown used to, excellent, and will keep me returning as a loyal customer.Thank you Amazon.
I didn't order these snack sticks from Amazon, but decided to give my review anyway. I'm required to get 60 grams of protein per day, so I have to be resourceful. I thought I'd try these sticks based on the many positive reviews. At first I was reluctant to eat them because of them being made from ostrich, but I couldn't taste anything different in them. They are delicious! They remind me of Slim Jim's but a lot better. They're not greasy and they're thicker. They are a bit difficult to chew, so be careful about that. Also, they're very filling. I could only eat half a stick at a time. I highly recommend this low-cal, high protein snack.
I saw this product reviewed on a website for older women who are trying to watch their weight and need a low calorie, high protein snack.  The reviewer, who was over 40, slim and beautiful, said she loved the stuff so I thought I'd give it a try.  I'm very, very glad I did!  I normally don't like beef jerky, don't like the taste and it's always so hard and chewy that it messes with my dental work.  Well, this jerky isn't chewy like most of them are and it was very tasty as well.  Highly recommend!
Really High in salt (3,250 mg/box) and a third of the calories are from FAT.  The package states that it contains less than 0.5% of MSG, etc....again with the neurotoxins!!!  The flavor is not really cheesy as you'd expect from the hype on the box.  The potatoes do remain firm though.  It's hard to describe the flavor.  Creamy yet artificial tasting. No, I really must NOT be sucked into buying these awful scalloped potatoes again.  Buy it at your own risk.
One 5 ounce box of the Betty Crocker Cheesy Scalloped Skin-On Potatoes makes a truly delicious potato casserole that will serve four.

I should have stayed with Idahoan brand. Poor Betty is on her last legs, rolling downhill into oblivion!I've used several brands of potato flakes and found them very good. But not Betty's brand. The finished product tastes stale. Bland, unpleasant, not worth continuing eating---but the worst part is STALE.  I am totally ashamed of Amazon for offrering these packets. My advice to any customer looking for good mashed potato flakes: Move on to Idahoan or another brand and leave poor Betty by the wayside.Where these packets should have been left. Alone. Ignored. Skipped over. By the way, I didn't like them!
I am not sure I understand why this product got such harsh reviews. I bought this because I love sweet potatoes but can't keep count of how many times I bought real potatoes only to throw them away because we didn't cook them quick enough to stop them from become soft and starchy. So I keep a few of these boxes in the house as a staple.As a rule I generally lighten up the liquid called for just a little bit and use one of the non margarine alternatives like earth balance or earth smart etc in lieu of butter or margarine. I like these quite a bit with a nicely grilled steak or chicken, etc. Are they as good as real sweet potatoes, no, but they are yummy enough to keep in the house for a quick an easy substitute, when you are hankering for a sweet potato but don't want to jump in your car to go buy fresh.
These are good in a pinch, especially since they don't need milk, which I always seem to be out of (no little ones at home). Although the other Betty Crocker mashed potatoes that do require milk has a better texture and fluff up better, with these you just need to watch the amount of water, or they'll end up too thin. They have a slight butter taste without that fake butter taste. Serve them up plain, with butter, with gravy, or any other way.Now, I'm off to order more...
To be honest, they tasted like any other instant mashed potatoes; neither really good nor really bad. I tend to make homemade mashed potatoes but I like to keep the instant around for those times when I only have twenty minutes to pull a meal together or I am just too tired to make the effort. I really like the separate pouches. In fact, I like them so much, I still have an open box of another brand of instant mashed potatoes that I have to measure out the portions of but I keep reaching for these instead because it's so quick and easy.Nutritional Information (2/3 cup prepared):Calories: 140Calories from Fat: 60Total Fat: 6gSaturated Fat: 4gTrans Fat: 0gCholesterol: 20mgSodium: 450mgPotassium: 320mgTotal Carb: 18gSugars: 2gProtein: 3gVitamin A: 4%Calcium: 4%** May contain wheat and soy ingredients
These are excellent.  Since they have cheese in them which adds a lot of taste, I've found if you don't have milk that they taste quite good just made with straight water instead of the water/milk mix called for on the side of the box.  Also, since the cheese sauce is rich enough, you can cook up some fresh potatoes and add them to stretch the number of servings and not compromise the flavour of the dish much.  Kind of depends if you are looking for something to cook really fast for supper or if you want more servings and are willing to spend a little more time doing it and save some money per serving. You can do both with this product and get good results either way.You won't be disappointed with these, in any case.  Excellent as a stock up item for the pantry.
I'm glad I bought one box of the Mashed Sweet Potatoes before buying a 12 pack of it from Amazon. My daughter made the mashed sweet potatoes following the box directions. The sweet potatoes looked just like the picture on the box. Looks can be deceiving though: the Betty Crocker Mashed Sweet Potatoes had a funky texture and a bad after taste. I ate my serving and told my daughter she did an excellent job preparing the potatoes as I didn't want to hurt her feelings. In truth, this is a very poor product and not up to Betty Crocker's normally high standards of prepared food mixes.Two star rating based on ease of preparation.Do not recommend.Penmouse
I am sorry I bought a dozen. The product tastes good the first time but then it becomes boring the second time. And by the third preparation the smell all over the house becomes objectional. I was hoping we would eat a box a week, but the onion taste and smell is so strong it stinks up our whole house for the day when we prepare the item.I bought on a subscription order basis but cancelled because of the overly strong seasoning.I also bought the Skillet Fries and am really sorry I did. They have the same seasoning and just as strong. I fixed half a box and after re-hydrating tried to rinse off a lot of the season but it didn't work.It will take a year or more for us to get rid of these. Probably give some to the postal workers homeless food collection at Thanksgiving.I wrote the company regarding reducing the seasoning but have had no response as yet.
These are so good without doctoring it up.  It is amazing that the potatoes look like potato chips before cooked and after baking, they are so creamy, tasty and tender.One thing I do when I have it is I increase the milk to 1-cup and decrease the water.  Add an extra tablespoon or so of butter.  This makes the dish more rich and creamy (yet they are still good following the box instructions).Finally, if you have cheese on hand (I use Velveeta) add some to the dish before baking.  About 1/3 cup hunks of Velveeta, or 2-3 slices of American cheese, or a big handful of shredded cheese.  Yummy.You could probably use these to make a nice potato soup.  Add cubed ham to it and it becomes a complete meal.
"Erythritol" has become our sugar substitute of choice since I became diabetic a few months ago. In crystal form, it seems about 70% as sweet as regular sugar. My wife uses a little bit of added sugar to bring the sweetness up for the rest of the family in things that need it, but I am happy with it as a one-to-one replacement for sugar in most things.I have not noticed any glycemic impact to my blood sugar or "laxative" effects seen with other sugar alcohol sweeteners (which is a very important consideration :-)Highly recommended!
I have been using erythritol in baking for about a year now.  After trying nearly every kind of sugar replacement, I have finally settled on this one.  It measures cup-for-cup like sugar, making it easy to adapt recipes and it acts just like sugar when it is baked.  Other artificial sweeteners turn baked goods dry or cakey or crumbly, but this stuff is PERFECT.It does have a slight &#34;cooling&#34; taste; not exactly minty.  I don't mind it, but it does make it difficult to use with some flavors.
I have to take away a star because it doesn't dissolve well in some things.  Crunchy GF fudge isn't fun unless it's the nuts that you're crunching on.  As for taste, I love it.  It is much less sweet than sugar, which is great for me since I haven't been a fan of real sweet since I was a kid.  I think I got burned out on sugar-too much of it!  I will stick to Stevia though because I love it's taste and it's much cheaper.  The pure Stevia will last me a long, long time and the Erythritol has only lasted a few weeks.
This would be a 5 out of 5 if only they hadn't mislabeled it as powder. This is definitely granulated. But aside from that it's a good low calorie sweetener. It doesn't have the same... um, gastrointestinal side effects as other sugar alcohols which is great. But if you're looking for a substitute for powdered sugar in recipes, know that you are going to have to take this and run it through a magic bullet or a coffee grinder or something. I used a magic bullet and made sugar free royal icing and it was great.
Just tried this product for the first time.  Since I find I'm so sensitive to sugar (almost any tiny amount sends me into cravings mode), I have been trying to find one that barely spikes your glycemic index and has no calories, etc.  True to reviews, it's not quite as sweet as regular sugar but as suggested, you can mix it with Stevia to get a good balance.  I have done that and pre-mixed it in an airtight container and I am very happy with the results for my baking needs.
It is granular, like sugar. It glistens a bit, as sugar does.  Although it will not bake like sugar, there is an abundance of recipes on-line using this.  This looks and tastes like sugar!  I put it in the canister, my husband uses it on fresh  berries, in coffee and tea.  He has not noticed!  And he is a picky eater and will NOT use anything that reduces sugar.  I will tell him in about 6 months.  I have only bought this brand, but I have seen brands that the customers stated it had a foul after taste.  I will stick with this- it really does, taste like sugar!
I follow a low glycemic diet and after years of trying all of the sweeteners out there I can attest that this product is the best for my needs.No after tasteBaker friendlyDelicious!I bought one 2.5 # package and am very pleased.Today I am purchasing two 2.5# packages - 2 single bags are less $ than the 2-pack.Erythritol Natural Sweetener Now Foods 1 lbs GranualI will leave one in it's original granular state and place the 2nd one in the food processor and turn it into a fine powder.This product is not quite as sweet as sugar, so for a recipe calling for 1 cup sugar, substitute  with 1 1/4 cup of Erythritol.
Not sure why, but I'm surprised more grocery stores don't carry this stuff.  No unpleasant aftertaste, and very low calorie.  Although it's only 70% as sweet as sugar, I started mixing it with some Nectresse (monk fruit and erythritol).  Nectresse is a lot sweeter than sugar, but it doesn't have any aftertaste either.  1 packet to about 2-3 tablespoons of erythritol makes it pretty much 1:1 sweetness of sugar.  I'll be getting more of this stuff.
Don't let the almost clinical look of the packaging fool you.  This is NOT some sort of strictly medicinal tea.  The flavor is awesome!  If sweet and spicy ginger is what you are looking for, buy this product.  While it does offer some medicinal benefits, I buy it for the flavor.  There is so much ginger, that you will find little pieces of the stuff collected at the bottom of your cup.  When I brew large amounts of chai tea, I always include a few bags of this for some added kick.
I can't speak of the benefits yet, but I'll comment on the taste. It doesn't really taste like ginger, it tastes like the spiciness left behind after you've eaten a sliver of it. It doesn't taste good, it's drinkable, but not pleasant. It's really spicy. All I taste is spice. It's not "strong" per say though. It also has stevia in it, and I can taste it, and I HATE STEVIA. Leaves a bad aftertaste. I will only buy this again if I notice any benefits, but I'm only on my second cup.Edit: I was drinking it regularly and it had no effect on me. I can't down a cup anymore, it's disgusting.
If you follow the directions on the box, steeping your tea, you will have a delicious, spicy cup of ginger tea.  This is real ginger taste, not an artificial one.I could not remember what brand of ginger tea I'd bought previously.  By reading the product description and consumer reviews, Traditional Medicinals Organic Ginger Aid seemed like a decent choice.  I am very happy with my selection.  I served it to a friend who loved it and shared half of my six boxes with her.  We'll be ordering more, I'm certain.
While I haven't tried every peppermint tea available, I have tried a half dozen or so of the ones I can readily get, and have found this one to be the best.I have tried other teas from Traditional Medicinals, and consider them to be one of the very best tea vendors in the market. I have never been disappointed in any of their products,and always look for them first if I am trying to find an herbal tea.Peppermint has many beneficial effects, and this is a great way to get that into your diet. Add a little steviaRecommended.
Traditional Medicinals makes some really nice tea, and their organic peppermint is one of the best. It is strong; none of that weak fare you get at your local grocery store. You can really taste the peppermint oil on your tongue, almost as if it were brewed from fresh peppermint. It is not sweet; add some honey or raw sugar if you like it that way. Excellent for your digestive track and memory, peppermint tea is a wonderful study aid and will help you stay focused without getting the jitters of caffeine.A first class tea, and easy to recommend to anyone who enjoys herbals.
I love this stuff. Never having regular BM's I started with 1 tea bag and by the next morning I would go. then I started to see that 1 tea bag wasn't doing anything, so I upped it to 2 tea bags..bam! Got the results I wanted...sometimes if I got really backed up or ate a ton of crap over the weekend or something and needed to clear out, I do 3 bags. I am also 6ft tall and weight 230lbs. I wouldn't suggest 3 teabags to my tiny friends unless you wanted to really punish somebody!
Years ago I wrote a review singing the praises of Smooth Move, which I'd drunk for years. But two different doctors told me it probably wasn't a good idea to drink it. One reason is that it stains your colon. So when you have a colonoscopy, it's more difficult for the doctor to see what's going on in there. Also, it's a stimulant laxative, which can cause problems with regular use. I now take Miralax, which works perfectly, and the doctor says I can take as much of that as I want.
My mom and I both used this and between the 2 of us we've finished 1 box.This is more effective than prune juice and kefir but not as fast actingas Swedish bitters. Took off 1 star since it contains senna -- which shouldbe avoided according to natural health books and according to a pharmacistfriend. But I would guess it's still less toxic than conventional laxatives.I'm ordering mom another box for her upcoming overseas trip. Travel can induceconstipation and I trust "Smooth Move" to do the job. For long term solution toconstipation I use fresh aloe vera gel (home-grown) and green vegetable juice.
First, I love the tea.  I like the taste and I like how each teabag is sealed in an airtight wrapper.  When I'm not feeling well I like to use a teabag of echinacea and bag of Organic Throat Coat [...]Second I really appreciate that they will tell you the country of origin for each ingredient in their teas.  So many companies these days are not transparent about that kind of thing.  I have not yet had the opportunity to request certificates of analysis but they do claim to adhere to "pharmacopoeial grade" teas.  This means that they SHOULD be testing to be in compliance with, probably, the European Pharmacopoeia .
I put 2 of these along with 2 or 3 decaffeinated Tetley's or PG Tips in a 20-oz mug and make tea every night, usually have 2 of them, and sleep like a baby.  Very soothing.  One thing I have noticed about THIS brand compared to OTHER brands, is that it IS TRULY medicinal.  So, don't overdo it on the Traditional Medicinals (especially the Smooth Move, lol - ain't nothing smooth about that stuff!)  This has a beautiful, fresh/minty but not too minty taste, very soothing.  Have bought more than once.
At least one of the ingredients in this tea has clinical evidence that it can help with anxiety.  You can look it up online, it is the passionflower.  Chamomile also has some clinical evidence but not as strong as passionflower.  So this isn't just a "feel good" tea--it is actually medicinal even though Traditional Medicinals can't say that or the FDA would land on them like a ton of bricks.  That's fine, just type passionflower in your favorite search engine.Beyond that this tea is a perfect addition to your nighttime ritual.  Having a bedtime ritual can help you fall asleep faster even if the tea itself does nothing at all.  I like to use the tea as a signal to my body and mind that the day is over and it is time now to relax and go to sleep.But please don't expect this tea to knock you out like an Ambien--it doesn't work that way.
Traditional Medicinals Organic Chamomile  Tea Bags  make delicious, soothing cups of tea.  From the very first time I tried this product I was convinced that it was not necessary to look for chamomile tea anywhere else.  The tea is exactly as described, and I make certain that Traditional Medicinal Organic Tea is well stocked in my pantry. It does not  cause drowsiness in any way whatsoever. It relieves stomach discomfort and as a result  it helps one to feel better.The great feature about this tea is that one can drink it  at any time.  It is not solely for the purpose of calming a digestive discomfort, but the fact that it helps in this way is an added plus.
I prefer black and green teas for everyday drinking, but when I need a nice smooth calming herbal tea, I go right for chamomile.  Not only does it soothe digestive issues, but it helps relax you--which is why chamomile is in some teas sold to make you have a good nighty-night.  Some brands mix their chamomile with other flavorings, but I prefer just the chamomile.  It has a nice floral quality to it and you don't need add anything to make it sweet unless you want to.  I tend to add a touch of honey, since honey is also so good for you.Please do follow the directions, though, and let this one steep for a good while so you will get the most quality and benefit out of the flowers.This is one of the better brands out there for chamomile tea, even besides the fact that its organic.  Well worth a little extra money to get.
Traditional Medicinals makes some very comforting teas. I keep a box of this tea sampler handy in case I get a cold. The "Throat Coat" tea is good to use when you first start feeling pain in your throat. The "Gypsy Cold Care" has hyssop in it which is antibacterial and antiviral. The "Echinacea Plus" tea also has echinacea which helps with sinus infections. When you are congested you can drink the "Breathe Easy" tea which has peppermint and eucalyptus in it. Some of the other ingredients in the teas include: licorice root, calendula flowers, ginger root, slippery elm, marshmallow root, wild cherry bark, fennel fruit, cinnamon bark, sweet orange peel, lemongrass leaf, elder flower, yarrow flower, rose hips, safflower petal and cloves. The teas all taste good and are very soothing.~The Rebecca Review
I don't go in for herbal remedies. When I'm sick, I grab some Robitussin or Sudafed, and that's that. If this has any legitimate medicinal value, it's just a nice bonus. From my standpoint, this is just a Damned Good Tea!It's got an unlikely minty licorice taste to it, which has really grown on me. I haven't found this taste in any other tea. The aroma is wonderful, and it cools the nose like a subtle eucalyptus, though that's not present in the taste. While it makes a great hot tea, it really shines for iced tea. I use one bag per 18oz or so, rather than the one bag per 12oz I'd normally use for iced tea brewing, and this works quite well. In addition to the refreshing taste, that coolness in the nose and the throat makes a great hot weather refreshment.
So many suffer from sore throats - due to allergy, common cold, overuse and other conditions. When you step in the drugstore or natural food store, there are many lozenges, tinctures, syrups and pills to chose from. Yes, some of them will nip your symptoms in the bud, or temporarily suppress them. For me, when I am feeling under the weather, I want a tea that not only gives me sweet relief, but, helps me heal. That is why I drink Traditional Medicinals Throat Coat. It is made with great ingredients, like organic licorice root, slippery elm bark, marshmallow root, cherry bark, bitter fennel fruit, cinnamon bark and sweet orange peel. The tea tastes delicious and really coats my throat in gentle herbal goodness.
Every year I make up a Christmas present box of alternative medicines for my son, who is prone to colds and hacky coughs.  This year I included a variety of Traditional Medicinals teas.  I was quite surprised to receive an unexpected phone call from him raving about Throat Coat's wonderful taste and soothing qualities.  I couldn't agree more.Usually I get feedback (good & bad) about some alternative I've given him, but never that quickly. Throat Coat's ingredients are a winning combination.  I notice they make organic Lemon Echinacea Throat Coat too--that may go in next year's Christmas care box.
I drink this tea 2-5 times a day, and noticed a steady supply of milk. It could be because of my increased water intake because of the tea, but I like to think that it's the tea itself. You have to let the tea steep for 10 minutes, which can be a bit bothersome because often times I find myself forgetting it. The taste is okay, I prefer a sweet tea, so adding some honey makes the tea taste a million times better than if you were to add sugar. I could hardly get over the smell (it smells like black licorice), but after a while it doesn't phase you. A huge plus is how CHEAP this is for 6 boxes. The grocery store I bought these at sells them for 5-6 bucks a box. Will definitely buy this again!
This really helped to increase my milk supply.  The taste wasn't so great for me, kind of a black licorice flavor but you get used to it. Also, it changes your body odor (might sound strange), but it makes it sweet smelling---kind of like maple syrup. One thing I did not like though was that it increased my appetite.  I mean DRASTICALLY increased my appetite.  I believe fenugreek was the culprit for the appetite increase, and I am positive it was for the body odor change.  Anyway, I used this tea for about 8 months, worked pretty well for its main purpose of milk production.
This did nothing for me, as far as I could tell...  and I was drinking 5 bags a day.  But on the plus side, the flavor wasn't too bad - I wouldn't pick it over one of my favorite teas just for drinking, but with a little turbinado sugar and milk, it was quite tolerable - unlike some medicinal teas I've had!  I am not a fan of licorace and feared this would be nasty to drink but it wasn't bad.  Worth a shot - great if it works for you, but if it doesn't, there are other things to try.  (Motherlove tintures seemed to boost my supply very well when this tea and fenugreek capsules didn't work)
I think that the only reason why this works for some people is because they are adding more liquid to their diet when they add this tea.  I was already a seriously lengthy water drinker and this made no difference to my milk production.  I am convinced that my epidural screwed my chances of breastfeeding easily.  I used pumps, which obviously work better than baby... but, even then my milk wasn't what it should have been.  My mother, grandmother, and aunts were all pretty surprised at the lack of milk I was producing, considering my healthy organic lifestyle and my large water and liquid intake.Oh well.  I tried this stuff for 3 months to no avail.
A friend of mine recommended this item my first month and thank goodness for getting good recommendations. First it works within a hour or so you got more milk production. I normally drink a cup towards the evening hours when I fall short. Also helps when you go through a milk clog and the production slows down it helps a lot to get you back to where you need to be for your baby. The milk tea as my husband describes it smells like liqurious candy and it kind a does. As a devoted tea drinker it was also nice to have something to drink besides camomile tea. So the Subscription deal comes pretty handy.
I drink this tea because it is supposed to be great to boost the female reproductive system.  I drink it daily with no sweetener and I really like it.  I haven't noticed any huge differences with my hormones or cramps yet but I think I will keep drinking this tea for a long time.  I have heard it is also good for strengthening the uterus during pregnancy (but I think you are supposed to be careful and maybe wait until the 2nd trimester to drink it).  Check out MamaNatural for more info on that topic.
This tea has a delightful flavor. Lightly sweet and just lemony enough to be refreshing. I added a little bit of honey and it was like candy. Despite being scrumptious I feel no effect on the soreness of my throat. I spent time with my boyfriend over the weekend and apparently caught whatever bug he was carrying. He's been home sick with a fever and sore throat for two days and my symptoms have just started. I was hoping to head off this cold at the pass by loading up on some herbal teas (which usually does the trick) but I'm half way through my second consecutive cup with no change what-so-ever. I may just have a super bug that requires something stronger than tea but I was hoping for at least SOME improvement. Back to Halls it is!
Soothing, tasty. Both the aroma & flavor are very good. It has a "sweet minty flavor" that is not overpowering. Definitely relaxes me.Too much mint and other potent herbs can flair up my reflux. Having GERD, i need to be careful about that and with this tea I don't notice any problems in that way.I have been a huge Yogi tea fan for years, but i don't i don't think their stress relief tea is as effective as this brand's.  This is my go-to.
I bought this locally and had a cup tonight.....I found that it did indeed relax me, so that impressed me immediately!  Sadly, though, I must be allergic to one or more ingredients as i began feeling some mild wheezing and had to take an allergy pill.  I think it may be the lavender but I'm not sure if it is anything more.  If you have seasonal allergies, be careful with the herbs that are in the same family as seasonal weeds.  I wish I wasn't allergic...it seems like an awesome blend.
I love Kava tea by Yogi. I used to purchase this in the local health food store, but they stopped carrying it after negative publicity of possible liver problems from Kava. I was pleased to find it on Amazon. Free shipping and the discount for &#34;subscribing&#34; makes it a deal too good to pass up.As far as the product itself, I love the taste of this Kava tea. I have a cup in the evening, and it is really soothing and relaxing. I could not imagine winding down in the evening without this tea.
When it comes to tea, I really can't get enough flavor. I love the various spices, so I was thrilled when I found this tea. It is intensely ginger, but also amped up with several other spices (Ginger Root, Lemongrass, Licorice Root, Peppermint Leaf, Black Pepper). Trust me, it isn't for the faint of heart.Though there are only 16 bags (less than the usual 20 for most brands) per box, each bag lasts two full (large) mugs without becoming weak. So I find it worth the money. Though I frequently buy tea on Amazon, I actually buy the Yogi Ginger tea from Trader Joe's as it is typically quite a bit less expensive there ($2.29 in my area at this time).
yeah yeah...it says it's ginger so why hold back stars for strong taste?...because it's a biting, bitter ginger taste. I have to brew it w/add'l tea bag of other flavor to lighten the intensity...but w/theYogi Stomach Ease, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)orOrganic Chamomile Tea 16 Bags(chamomile is more bland than stomach ease) the ginger is tolerable.Ginger DOES work for nausea but a quicker, less offensive relief can be had when eating a small piece of dried (sugared?) ginger. The tea I use for maintenance for a particular problem.
After reading some of the reviews here, I decided to try a single box from the grocery store before investing in 6 boxes of 16 bags.  Next time, I'll buy in bulk!  I love ginger, and find that I don't need to sweeten this tea (unusual for me).  I don't find it intense, as some reviewers do; but if I did, it would be easy to tone it down by simply adding additional water or steeping for less time.  This delicious tea, which incidentally soothes my persistent heartburn, has become a nightly routine for me.
I love all things ginger, so my opinion may be a bit biased. Fresh ginger is a favorite of mine because of the spicy, astringent bite it has. This tea reminds me of that, although the spicy bite is probably due to the black pepper added. I've tried other ginger teas, lemon ginger teas, green ginger teas - they all seem to have a dry/dull ginger flavor, and I always come back to this one. I love this tea with a dash of honey. It's sweet and spicy and gingery goodness.
I know what Ginger tastes like and this is NOT Ginger. The only things I found pleasant about this tea is that it came in a beautiful box and the individual packs were nicely packaged, I don't care whether this is organic or not, the flavor of Ginger is absolutely absent. If you appreciate the aroma and strong flavor of good cup of Ginger tea then try "Prince of Peace" Honey Ginger Crystals. The aroma lights up the room, the flavor is strong and authentic and since they are crystals, there are no tea bags to deal with and the result is a good clean cup of genuine Ginger tea.
I tried different ginger herbal tea brands but came back immediately to the Yogi one. Its taste is un-comparable because in fact it contains other very interesting herbs (peppermint/licorice/lemongrass) which makes it not so spicy as if it were pure ginger. I take this tea mostly for its digestive function and cannot start my day without my cup of hot and delicious ginger herbal tea ! It "cleans up" my digestive track.Should you have any digestive issues during the day, take a cup and you will see how effective it is as long of course as you do NOT add any sugar or syrup or milk in this tea. And we are talking about the herbal ginger tea, not a black tea which has ginger in it.
I discovered this product a couple of years ago and I've been hooked.  I get the worst cramps every month, so bad that I have to take advil even though I hate taking anything for pain.As long as I start drinking this tea 3-4 days before my period, all is good!  My period arrives on time and the pain is gone or tolerable enough that I don't have to take advil.  I go through a whole box that time of the month b/c you have to drink it all day for a few days before/during your period to make sure you stay ahead of the pain.If you get horrible PMS, bloating, cramps or headaches before/during your period, I highly recommend you try this product before taking pain killers.
The older I get the more painful my periods are with severe cramping and bloating. I love drinking tea when I'm at work so I thought I'd give this a try and I haven't noticed a change in my cramping/bloating. The taste isn't &#34;bad&#34; but it's not &#34;good&#34; either. Basically, what I mean is it's not bad-tasting but I'd only drink it if it worked well. Some people said they started taking it days before their period and it helped so maybe that's what you need to do. I only drank it during my period. Everyday of it; and I didn't notice a difference.
I've been taking this tea on and off for the past 6 months. If I don't take this tea I'm irritable, have severe mood swings, cramps and sometimes even fever during the days leading up to my cycle. Taking this tea daily 1 1/2 weeks before my scheduled time eliminates the moods, the headache/fever, the cramps, everything! It also helps in the cleansing process itself. No side effects and no harm to your system make this tea a MUST. I'm buying another box :)
This herbal tea is huge aid in reducing symptoms of pms.  I started using this years ago and was buying it from the local health food store for about five dollars per box.  I used it a week before my cycle and then every day during.  It made an immediate and very noticeable improvement.  My husband bought it for me when I started running low.  He noticed that I wasn't the witch I used to be when I drank the tea.  I make sure to keep this stuff on hand all of the time now.  Another thing I also drink is fresh lemon balm tea which also helps very much.
I bought this tea because of the wonderful reviews on Amazon.  I love reading up before purchasing.  I tried it from my local health food store first to make sure I liked the taste.  I really enjoyed it so I purchased from Amazon when I couldn't find it at the stores.  Imagine my surprise that it was cheaper to purchase it off amazon.  This is not always the case but happily for me this time it worked out.  I got six boxes so I can clean my liver to my hearts content!
In all fairness and full disclosure, I've never tried dandelion root tea before this, so I have no basis for comparison. That being said, this stuff is delicious! Has a very mild, smooth, faintly sweet nutty taste (which I assume is from the roasting of the root); pleasant and totally calming. Especially tasty when steeped together w/kukicha twig tea. In Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine, dandelion root is often used to purify the blood and soothe indigestion. There's also some evidence pointing to its effectiveness in helping treat hypoglycemia and hypertension. But therapeutic applications aside, I really love this tea and will definitely be buying more.
In researching dandelion root, I came across a lot of different, sometimes contradictory claims, none of which seem to be backed up by any serious research. I believe it does have a diuretic and possibly laxative effect, and it is supposedly good for the liver. Again, those claims may be dubious, but I could see this as a good coffee substitute if you had to cut down for some reason (caffeine, acid). It tasted terrible to me at first, but after about 4 cups I really started to like it. I brew it with two teabags and steep for 15 minutes. Now it basically tastes like coffee to me (note that I'm more of a tea drinker, however).
I drink this tea twice a day for it's benefits. I just drink it straight with nothing added and I actually enjoy it! With this and my breakfast smoothie, I no longer drink coffee.  And best of all, with this tea and my twice dailyBragg Apple Cider Vinegar Organic Raw -- 32 fl oz, I have no more inflammation in my body!! I always had inflammation, especially abdominal, and I'm so amazed at how great life is without inflammation. The combination of those two products has also helped my whole gastro-intestinal environment as well as peristalsis, I am so pleased!
I was looking for tea to get me off of my highly caffeinated ones.  I saw this on sale at a decent price at my local grocery and decided to give it a whirl it was so cheap.  I really liked it.  I don't have any liver problems but I'm sure my liver could use a good cleaning.  My health conscious friend kept telling me I need to eat foods or do a cleanse that releases the bile of the liver so I don't get a liver stone build-up.  I told him I was drinking this tea and he said it's a start.  I did the subscribe 'n' save to save a little on the bulk teas.  Also the directions on the box say to use it for 4 - 6 weeks and you can't do that drinking it 3 times a day with just one box.  Amazon has a good deal here.
I have at least one cup of this every day.. Someone said it would help clean out your liver.. I hope so, though I do not know.. But, on faith, I am trying it.. And, so far, so good, no issues.. But, what is an issue is that I have to plan further ahead.. The brewing time for a bag of this is fifteen minutes.. So, if you are interested, I think this is a good choice, but it does take extra time to brew...
I have tried other brands of herbal ginger teas and this one is definitely the best one by far! Other brands had funny tastes and I had to force myself to finish the box up. Traditional Medicinals organic ginger tea tastes great all by itself, which is how I drink it every day now. I also mix it with my favorite organic green tea every day. It really gives it a nice "bite"! I find green tea too bland when it is not mixed with something else. The health benefits of ginger are well known and it is great to be able to consume it every day in tea form!
I've tried many ginger teas and this one is by far the best tasting.  I add a little agave to sweeten it and it's just perfect.  Not too weak, not too strong.UPDATE AS OF FEB. 1, 2014:  THIS TEA HAS CHANGED AND IS NOW ONE OF THE MOST TERRIBLE TEAS I'VE EVER TASTED.I have been drinking this tea almost everyday for many months now, but today I got my second bad order of it. So, it will have to be sent back, or thrown away, or whatever. But it is now TERRIBLE. TERRIBLE!!!!! I was so loyal to this brand and this flavor but I cannot drink it anymore. The smell is different, the taste is absolutely awful. I'm going to e-mail the company but in the meantime, if you drink this tea, stop. It has changed and the change IS NOT for the better. BOOO.
If you love the peppery flavor of ginger, this tea is for you.  The longer the tea bag sits, the stronger the ginger taste.  What I like best about it is the true ginger flavor.  I've tried other brands and they just aren't as potent.Whether you drink it strictly for taste or use it to soothe your stomach, this one's a great choice.  If you're drinking it just for enjoyment, try this:  steep your tea, allowing the bag to sit in the water until it's cool.  Add honey, stir, and pour over ice.  Delicious!
When I have trouble winding down, I make myself this tea. It has stevia in it, so once I weaned myself off of needing REALLY SWEET tea, I realized that I don't need to add anything to it. The longer it steeps, the better it tastes. This is what started my love affair with Yogi teas. It's usually about $4.50 a box in the grocery stores (DC area, so your mileage may vary), so the subscribe and save option on here, or even just getting one six pack, is a HUGE savings. Highly recommended.
As someone who has issues with a racing mind & thus gets very little sleep, but is very opposed to medication, I've been through a few relaxation techniques and supplements including:-Late-night runs-Melatonin-Sleepytime Tea (for Keurig)-Background sounds-Late-night writingThis tea is hands down the best thing I've done for my sleep. It helps relax my mind and make me comfortable, but not groggy or drowsy. The flavor is amazing, and has a quick honey aftertaste - I have debated looking for one without valerian to drink during the day!This product is so good that despite having a very expensive Keurig coffee machine (which I do use in the mornings/day), I still buy this tea as opposed to other types of bedtime tea. I use the keurig to produce hot water only, and drop the tea bag into the cup.
This is one of my most favorite teas. I brew a cup of this almost every night and add a little bit of half and half. It has a nice light licorice flavor and the stevia in it adds the perfect amount of sweetness. Everyone I've made it for loves it, too. Even my sister in law who hates anise flavored things. And it really does seem to work. :) Also this is a great value. Especially if you get it on subscribe and save with enough stuff for 15% off.
I bought 5 different varieties of Yogi tea and find that this blend is the most tolerable of the Yogi teas I have had so far.  I don't care for the stevia at all, there is a taste that really turns me off and I believe it is the stevia but ... they use so many ingredients in their teas that it is hard to pinpoint the actual villian.  We use stevia at home but it seems that stevia in processed products takes on a weirder flavour - to me anyways.  I do not find that this tea relaxes me either but something in it feels like a stimulant.  I will go back to my valerian, stinky but simple, clean and relaxing.
i've tried many calming & bedtime teas & none of them work for me, this is no exception. maybe i'm just immune to the ingredients???  i don't know. or perhaps i am just WAY too high strung & i need a triple dose or something.  all i know is it didn't help me fall asleep the two or three times i tried it.  and i don't like the taste of valerian, so while this blend really isn't that bad compared to some others i've tried it is "not my cup of tea".
I have not always been a serious tea lover, but this tea has really changed my mind about how wonderful tea can make you feel.  This bedtime tea has a much more rich and complex flavor than other sleepy time teas.  It does contain natural ingredients that may affect medications that you are currently taking, so please read the box.  I enjoy this tea in the evening.  It has a very rich flavor that does not need to be sweetened.I love the packaging so you can take some with you if you are traveling.  Included on every tea bag is an uplifting fortune.  The price here is so much cheaper than my natural health store.  I can buy the package of six here for what three boxes of tea cost at my local store.  All in all I really enjoy this tea, and have given away several packages as I find this tea relaxing and tasty.  If you are looking for a new bedtime tea, I would highly recommend this tea for you.
This is the best of the "bedtime" teas.  I don't love all the yogi products, but i must have this in my cabinets at all times.  And it's become more challenging to find in my grocery stores, AND it's about $4 a box.  Amazon is cheaper and they bring it to my door!This tea offers both chamomille and valerian root.  the latter is similar to melatonin, in that it is a subtle herb and it builds up in your system over time.  I have a cup of Bedtime every evening around 8 or 9, and it helps me unwind.  I believe that part of the unwinding is the ritual of having tea everynight, but this tea does seem head and shoulders above the others i've tried.  and i like it.  What more could you ask?
I have had insomnia all my life.  I take Unisom sometimes, but I don't like taking a pill to help me sleep.  I have been drinking this tea every night for a week and it really helps me to relax and sleep.  I have had some intense dreams after drinking this tea, but at least I am sleeping for once in my life. The taste is not unpleasant to me.  I love tea and this is not one I would drink for the taste, but it isn't bad.
I have been a yogi tea lover for years and have purchased countless boxes here on Amazon. While I was looking intosome new blends I came across a few reviews that made me angry at myself because I stopped closely monitoring their labels because I had developed a trust for this brand.This is what I found when I started digging#1 almost none of the ingredients are Organic like they used to be#2 The company had a hostile takeover in 2010 where the widow of the of the founder was defrauded by forged documentsresulting in several lawsuits. (source wikipedia)#3 They are now using so called natural flavors. If you watch Dr. Oz you will know there is nothing natural about what they can doto your body, they pose many health concerns and there are now scientific studies to show this.#4  Gross out alert !  those with religious & ethical food concerns such as Kosher, Halal, & Vegetarians should know alongwith the rest of us that beaver anal ( yes a beaver BUTT) secretions are used as Vanilla, Strawberry and Raspberry naturalflavoring called  Castoreum.

I have a lot of pain issues and have a very hard time getting to sleep, don't want to take drugs to go to sleep and with this tea I don't have to.  It really works, one bag relaxes me enough to drift off to sleep and on those nights I'm having a lot of problems two bags just knocks me out.  It has a lot of really potent herbal extracts that are strong such as Valerian, Skullcap and those two together will really relax you.  Highly recommend.
I wanted this tea for the detoxification properties but was wary of what the taste would be like. I really despise licorice and was concerned that this may be overly strong due to all the herbs. This is a very sweet, very balanced and smooth tea. I'm not crazy about the taste but I can drink it every day with ease. The licorice is more of a sweetness than it is a flavor. It starts out a little peppery and is backed by strong sweetness and light floral notes. It tastes better warm than cold.
I love this tea! It is herbal(non-caffeinated), so I can drink it day or night. Usually I choose to drink it at night, because I Yogi Blueberry Slim Life (Green Tea) during the day. I tastes pretty good. At first I was unsure about the flavor, but it really grew on me. I think it does do some mild detoxing to the body, because I feel like I have more energy when I use it. I do not use every day - more like a month on and then a month off. I think it helps with food cravings when I am trying to cut back and loose a little weight. I highly recommend. The benefits are great with a healthy lifestyle.
I guess it's a matter of tastebuds but unless this healed me for good I wouldn't drink another sip if I was paid to drink it. Okay - there might be a price that would make me drink it everyday but only one cup and the price is pretty high :-) I've tried several yogi teas and this one as well as the others are just absolutely horrible.  If I don't like something or I have an allergic reaction (which I frequently have from foods or preservatives) I usually pass it on to my mother or sister so the money isn't wasted but this, I threw away, every last package.  Another good reason for Amazon to sell food in smaller quantities. YUCK!
This tea is fantastic, I use it usually around mid-day when I'm wanting a snack and it shuts those cravings right up. It seriously is like having a little meal; it's extremely satisfying and a very good way to manage food cravings. The taste and smell is just the best, it's mostly savory with a little bit of sweet. For me the most prominant flavors are the fennel seed (love it), licorice root, clove, ginger, pepper, and cardamom. It has the same sort of effect on me as eating a few crackers or handful of chips, it's just very satisfying. I highly recommend this to any and everyone.
I've tried several Yogi tea flavors and this has to be one of my favorites. When you drink Yogi tea, you know the taste is going to be out of ordinary. For me, it took a couple tries to get used to some flavors. However, this one I enjoyed it from my very first cup. Now I drink it daily. I found that if I drink this tea first in the morning before I eat anything else, I don't crave for coffee or sweet for the day. If I choose to drink coffee first, I notice that I feel hungry sooner and want to eat more. Now I have this healthy fasting tea as my secret weapon to curb my craving, I am just thrilled to have something help me eating less. Two thumbs up! Yogi!
I drink a lot of tea, and have become a huge fan of Yogi teas.  In fact, I've never been let down by Yogi tea.  The individual packaging is high quality, and the tea bags are kept very fresh.This Kombucha tea is tasty and has a wonderful aroma.  I'm not sure what kind of kombucha is in it though, because a big part of kombucha are the probiotics and obviously those would be absent from a packaged dry tea.  That being said, I love this tea and have recommended to friends.Flavor is a clean mint with plum.
Yogi Green Tea Kombucha is by far the best tasting tea I have ever had the pleasure of consuming!  Knowing that Kombucha is a very sour/bubbly drink I expected a sour/bubbly tea, but this is NOT at all sour.  Some slight fizzing possibly but mostly a wonderfully pleasant, green tea with lemongrass flavor.  I couldn't/can't detect any Kombucha taste, but I certainly can feel the Kombucha difference.  I have more energy, less appetite and an overall happier feeling.  I drink it first thing in the morning, before lunch, dinner and before bed.  I love this tea.  I just LOVE this tea!  I've gone to auto delivery monthly for a pack of 6 because I am constantly drinking this and sharing this tea.  It's that good.
After reading that some people have issues with Kombucha tea, I Googled it and read some more. I recommend that others do the same before drinking it. I am sure that Yogi Tea produces their Kombucha in a careful environment, but it can cause health problems. It also does not appear to be appropriate for people with Candida despite some claims. It contains alcohol, sugars, fungi, yeast and molds, and a study showed that it did not improve symptoms of people with Candida. I've been drinking it almost daily and have been having unexplained stomach aches lately and will try eliminating this tea to see if it helps, now that I know more. Again, read up on Kombucha and make your own informed decision.
The kombucha and the decaf kombucha are both really good.  No matter how long you oversteep this tea it does not get bitter & will still taste great.  This goes for all Yogi green teas.  My favorites are the kombuchas, green tea super anti-oxidant & green tea rejuvination. They are so good.  I drink Yogi teas every single day at work, normally with various different flavors of Yogi tea mixed together.  I like to steep 2 bags at once & always leave the tea bags in my mug.  You can re-use the tea bags but the 2nd time around will be a weaker brew.  I like strong green tea so i often use several tea bags at once.  Usually 2 to start out and then i re-use those 2 tea bags & add one more for the next cup.
I love Yogi Bear tea, (as my bf calls it).  It is smooth, delicious, and there are many different flavors to choose from w/ Yogi.  We get this and the Kirkland's green tea, and we prefer this one more often.  They make great gifts too! I will usually get the 6 packs, so that I can pass some along to family and friends.  My suggestion is to add a few drops of EZ-Sweetz (4-5 drops max for an average coffee/tea mug) and drink w/ a glass straw (helps preserve the environment and helps prevent teeth stains), for a deliciously sweet and tasty drink.
Brewed and tasted a wide range of mass produced green teas, including Yogi.Large scale production for mass consumption results in a very low-grade tea quality, and a low price.Mass production results in a depletion of the natural nutrients.This enables low prices, while the benefits are very limited, or absent.The enormous varieties of low-grade teas are typically grown at lower altitudes where the plants are pruned to create the maximum yield, via larger leaves. The processing is rapid to lower cost, and to establish large scale distribution.Quality is compromised.Cultivation, processing, and packaging of green teas to preserve the rich antioxidant profiles created by nature, is an exquisite art form.An excellent rendition of this exquisite art form is realized in the high-quality, Matcha and Sencha tea offerings from Kyoto, Japan, by Maison Tea Ikkoku.Green teas, by Maison Tea Ikkoku reflect a celestial combination of excellent quality, flavor, and vibrant well-being.Enjoy.
I love the Yogi brand range of tea and this is one of my favorites. This green tea has a strong lemongrass scent and flavor which makes it really refreshing and a great pick-me-up. I drink a cup daily and it makes me feel rejuvenated and energized. The tea contains grapeseed and amla extract which are natural antioxidants, so drinking this also has detoxifying benefits. The herbs contained in this tea are mostly organic, i.e. organic lemongrass, organic green tea leaf, organic licorice root, jasmine green tea leaf, organic alfalfa leaf, organic burdock root, organic dandelion root, and irish moss powder. There is a small amount of caffeine in this tea, about 21 mg which is still way less than the amount of caffeine found in regular coffee. I love it!
When I first tried this tea, I was thinking - wow! this is some different tea I have had in my life. I like it actually changes my taste buds after I drank it daily. I am on my quest to achieve my goal weight, and I found that this tea helps me not craving sweets anymore which if you are losing weight, this is a big plus. It's a wonder and it helps me go to the restroom more often. On those days I am having my period, I drank the tea and it smoothed my cramps too. I brought some in to share with my co-workers, somebody like them, some dislike them. It's really a personal preference. For me, this is going to be a staple in my kitchen pantry.
This tea was very good, however the mild flavor got boring after drinking it for a long period of time. Drinking it sporadically would probably be best. It is a very nice tea for right before bed, and does not need sugar or honey for a nice flavor. I would order it again, however I think my 6 boxes will keep me well stocked for a very long time. My favorite tea from yogi is the Cocoa Spice, which I suggest to everyone as it has a nice deep flavor and can be taken with or without milk.
I've never had Chai tea before, because I don't drink green or black teas, but upon hearing that Chai tea was really good, I was pleased to find an herbal Chai.I've been very pleased with this tea. It has a nice blend of flavors, but no one is overpowering. It smells great when you are steeping it. I pop a couple of these in my fuzzy logic rice cooker, set it on for 10-15 minutes, pour some sugar and milk in, and enjoy it. My wife loves it too.If you want a great smelling, great tasting herbal Chai Tea, give this a shot. I can't compare it to other teas, but I like it. You also get a good amount of tea for a rather decent price.Hope this review was helpful. If you have any questions or if I can clarify anything, leave me a comment!
A couple years ago I drank this every day. It was rich with cardomom flavor. When I recently reordered I found that like everything else in this sorry world, the quality of the tea had deteriorated drastically. It is bland and flat compared with the spicey richness of flavor in the past. I wrote to complain; they replied they used the same "recipe." It's the ingredients and the process that count--not the recipe!  I may have to make it myself.January 2014.I bought a couple of boxes in hopes they had raised their standards. No such luck. Crummy crummy crummy. I wonder how these people can live with themselves, knowing they're selling inferior products.
The Yogi Chai Rooibos tea is one of the best chai teas I've ever tasted! It has a naturally sweet flavor that is not overpowering, and I love it because I do not have to add sweetener to it. There is also a hint of ginger and spice which makes this a great pick-me-up, wonderful given the fact that it is also caffeine-free! This is an excellent herbal tea which is healthy and made with organic ingredients. It can also be steeped in milk for those desiring a milky taste or taken as is. I would also recommend the Green Tea Antioxidant by the same brand.
For purposes of this review, I made a cup of Yogi Green Tea (Pure Green 16 Count Box) and now present my findings.  I used Chrystal Springs Distilled Water, which I brought to a rapid boil and then poured over the tea bag in a medium sized mug.  I dunked the tea bag ten times and then covered the mug with a plate for the three minutes recommended on the tea box.The freshly brewed tea has a faint, grassy smell.  The taste is mild, with a slightly bitter after taste.  The taste reminds me of the green tea served in Chinese restaurants.Next I brewed another cup of the Yogi Green Tea, added a teaspoon of orange blossom honey, and two slices of a honey-bell orange.  This is a delightful beverage.  The mild green tea allows for the full flavor of the honey and orange slices to be experienced.  This last cup of tea is the one I recommend.
My wife and I both love coffee, and tea to a lesser extent. I've realized over the years that my preference for coffee is largely due to two factors: the strength of the flavor, and the 'thickness' of the drink. This is one of the few teas that rivals coffee in both departments. That's not to say it tastes anything like coffee--it is strong and aromatic, but sweet and almost nutty, not acidic or tending towards bitter. The hazelnut and vanilla flavors mingle quite nicely in this dark, expressive tea. Yogi makes some really fine teas, including this one.If you like substantial flavor in your teas, give this one a try. My wife and I both really enjoy it.
I'm not sure why this is called Woman's Energy. Maybe it revs up some women, but for me, it's the exact opposite, and I get drowsy and sleepy, but it's a "peaceful, easy feeling". It does contain chamomile. The taste, well, it's an herbal tea, and most of them taste like grass to me, but with a dollop of almond milk and a little agave nectar, it's quite drinkable. I'm post menopausal, and I'm trying to get my HRT on a moon phase schedule, so I plan to begin drinking this only on the 4th week of my cycle to see if it will help balance my hormones, which have been a mess since my surgery nearly 20 years ago, even with compounded bio-identical hormone cream. I would recommend this tea but not for an energy boost.
I have the worst cramps every month. By this I mean the kind of cramps that make you want to stay in bed with a heating pad for the rest of the day. But this tea really helps to make them more bearable. I've found that it helps to start drinking the tea a couple of days ahead of time and for extra bad cramps I use two tea bags instead of one. As for the taste I actually like the spicy orange flavor, you can add a dash of cream to help tone down the spicy flavor if needed.
Paired with oatmeal, I have had more milk than my daughter can consume! I've been breastfeeding for 6 weeks now and this week is when I noticed a difference in my supply.  I added the tea maybe around week 2-3 and only a cup a day, so i don't even drink the recommended 3-4.  I didn't like the taste at first, but now I really enjoy the flavor, and almost crave it! Of course, I love that it's organic too!
I used this tea for my first baby and breastfed/pumped for a year.  I had a full supply and had amassed a frozen stash that allowed my son to drink defrosted milk for 2 months after I stopped pumping.  I'm now breastfeeding/pumping for my 3-month old and drinking this religiously.  I again am amassing a large supply and able to provie exclusive breastmilk while still freezing the extra.I'm not a huge hot beverage drinker, but I quite like the taste of this tea.  It has a subtle licorice undertone.  I take mine with one Splenda and it helps to cut that subtle flavor and make the tea quite tasty!
OK, so I can't tell if it's making that much of a difference as far as milk production goes.  I've done pretty well regardless, but have tried both this tea as well as the Traditional Medicine version and haven't noticed a difference between the two.I don't really have a reason to be paranoid, but I tried the teas to halp build up my freezer stopck of milk in case I have any issues with production and need a good supply of back-up.  As a result I've tried the teas and brewers yeast pills.  I didn't see a significant increase, but they have served as a security blanket of sorts for me :-)However, I wanted to put this review up because so many of the others talk about how tasty the Yogi version is. I just wanted to say that I think the Traditional Medicines and Yogi tea versions taste almost exactly the same, so go with whichever you find the best deal on!
I have consumed two boxes of this and my milk supply has dramatically decreased!  I am trying to isolate any other potential variables and will try to stick with it (since I have 4 boxes left!) but I am disappointed.  Also, this has Anise in it so it you like black licorice you should enjoy the taste.  I however strongly dislike black licorice and have a very difficult time drinking it.  If my supply increases later I will come back and change this review otherwise this has been a waste of money and a bad tasting experiment.***Update, my review stayed.  I will be throwing the last couple of boxes away.  Not work my time or money. Too bad.
This tea doesn't taste much like raspberries to me but it i a great help during my monthly period pains. Without this tea I get pain so bad that I can barely stand and have broken into sweats from the pain (I don't usually sweat easily). Since I can't take most pain relievers due to a bad stomach I decided to look for something holistic. I try to take it when I know my period is coming I take this tea a my pain is mostly gone but it only takes like 20mins to work if that day comes before I expect. If you get bad cramps, I highly recommend you try this tea!
I saw all the 5 star reviews and figured it'd be fantastic or something. Not so much...The gummy texture is more like an unrefined gummy, like something you'd buy for a couple cents at an old candy store. It's more like hardish jell-o than actual gummy, but that may be how Japan makes theirs. Either way, I didn't really like it. The flavor wasn't as vibrant as I was hoping. Kind of a muted kiwi flavor. The seeds inside the gummy added a little, but not much.Also there's a weird coating on the gummies that prevents them from sticking to their wrappers but it turns into a weird jelly-like coating on the roof of your mouth.
These gummies are the most delicious I have tasted. Compared to their American counterparts, these are practically the real fruit. Their flavor is fresh and bright, and they taste just like the real thing, but with that fun gummy texture.Kiwi is one of my favorites because, unlike many other candies, this flavor is subtle and not obnoxiously sweet. The seeds add a fun little crunch, and the hint of tanginess makes it taste more like the real fruit...though it could be tangier. They go fast because they are so good--I definitely recommend them!
My husband is a gummy candy fanatic. I had bought this in the hopes of finding a new brand he enjoyed but neither of us were all that thrilled with this one. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't horrible by any means and we did eventually finish the bag, but we didn't love it enough to want to pay $6 for more. If you want to try something new, I would definitely recommend this but I think you can find much cheaper gummy candy around that taste the same if not better.
I used to drink cups of coffee but it gave me diarrhea. My job at a nuclear power plant at night demands that I sit for long periods and can not take bathroom breaks frequently. I looked for a natural alternative to coffee.PERO is what I found. It is about $5 a can, which is said to make 175 cups. The taste isn't the most exhilarating but it's okay on cold days with cookies or burnt toast. I use milk, not water as I'll vomit if I use water. In all, it's healthy and a basic drink and suffer from stomach cramps or tied up intestines. I have 5 cups a day, along with a carton of French cigarettes.

Now, I LOVE my coffee, and I enjoy a cup every now and then.  However, when when I want a cup of coffee, and I'm more conscious of not getting all the caffeine, this is a SUPER delicious alternative.  I find a bit more than the teaspoon of this natural chicory/malt beverage, gives me a medium coffee taste.  I've served it to visitors, and they never noticed a difference.  Going the healthier route, well, you can't lose with this product in your cabinet.
I hesitated but then still decided for this to be the only product that I ever took a star from for being too good. Too good to the point of being addictive. I know, sugar can be addictive anyway. But this chewy candy, provided you like the taste of condensed milk, is insanely so. If they ever produce a version with stevia or xylitol to make it less unhealthy, I'll give it ten stars.In the meantime, you might also want to check outHigh Concentrated Milk Hard Candy (Japanese Import). The hard candy consistency takes some of the addictiveness away.
We're in the process of doing our shitake growing kit right now.  After a week or so, we're starting to see the mushrooms taking form.  It's been really easy to do and fascinating to watch.  We have it out on our kitchen counter where we can spray it every day with water and are excitedly watching as our mushrooms sprout.  My husband and I are both serious cooks and shitake mushrooms are always a welcome addition to many dishes.  Having them fresh, instead of dried, is something we're looking forward to, although dried are very good too and some say better.  We may try drying these ourselves, too, as it looks like there will be an abundance!
And healthy too.  And surprisingly it's also very tasty, though to be honest, it wasn't love at first taste for me.  But after trying it several times and a few cups later, the taste is rather good.  So don't judge this tea too harshly after only one cup.  You should give it a chance and try several cups before you decide whether you like it or not.  Brown rice tea has been around a very long time and generations of people have enjoyed it and today we know that it provides a very healthy alternative to other types of drinks offered on the market.  Try it, I'm sure you'll like it.
I'm a serious athlete who can look back a decade or more at that one choice we used to have of nutrition bars - the old Power Bar.Now every joker who can snatch an oat from a horse's feed bag can manufacture a "health" or "nutrition" bar.The Organic Protein bar is the only bar worth eating. The company is NOT  trying to fool you into feeling good, by jacking you up with sugar. This is what almost all bars on the market now do.Isn't it ironic that parents complain about all the sugar in foods that do this, boost energy, in kids? Mom and dad then buy junk nutrition bars to feel better about their own eating habits.Stop playing with your health.Go for protein, instead of carbs, and buy the Organic Protein bar, if you're truly concerned about your health.
Being primarily raw, we finally see a healthy raw food bar on the market. Well,  it's been out a few years, but I'm just reviewing it now. :)This bar tastes pretty good.  The texture is a little weird, but I can look past it, for the nutritional benefits, and the taste really isn't all too bad.  It doesn't taste like a snickers bar, but it's also not rock-hard and crunchy, like many other raw food bars.All in all, good bar.  I recommend them to any health conscious athlete.
This bar is one of my favorites.  I switch between this and 2 other "organic greens" bars before my morning run every a.m.  It's almost too sweet for me but I've gotten used to it and the belgium chocolate makes it so rich.  You get these little chunks of fabulous chocolate in every bite along with all the goodness of healthy, organic greens and ingredients and it tastes too good to be healthy.  Some days I can't help but eat more than one throughout the day..they are that good!I am getting ready for another order before my other 2 bar flavors are even out just because I don't like being without this flavor.  I crave it and so does my hub who has to have bites out of every one of these he sees me with. :D (Yeah, I give him his very own whole one occasionally....)
I was a little disappointed in this product.  I bought it for my husband who has diabetes but who loves dark chocolate.  It tasted bland to both of us.  For the price I was expecting a bit of a "gourmet" taste, a chocolate with a smooth, creamy melt.  This chocolate tasted a bit gritty and was neither smooth nor creamy.What I did like was that the vendor enclosed a chemical pack with the shipment that kept the chocolate cool enough despite the summer heat.  This chemical pack prevented the chocolate from arriving in a brown, mushy package.
I don't have to lose weight. However, I am fighting chronic candidiasis and I have to stay away from sugar, all refined carbs and dairy products. When I found these chocolate bars,(which taste great to me!) I wrongly believed I had finally found the chocolates that wouldn't feed my Candida. I was wrong because Maltitol does feed Candida. I found out that XYLITOL is the **only** sweetener that does not feed the yeast. Fortunately, I managed to find delicious dark chocolate bars sweetened with Xylitol on the Internet and I am going to stick to those. Being that Xylitol is so healthy, why isn't it used on more products? Unfortunately, many of us already know the answer. :(
I don't know, maybe it's because dark chocolate isn't as sweet as regular chocolate anyway, but I found these sugar-free dark chocolate bars absolutely satisfying and delicious.  As someone following the Atkins diet (with considerable success), it's always great to find a successful low-carb, sugar-free version of the foods and snacks formally crossed off the "okay to eat" list.  I'm certainly going to re-order another supply.By the way, although I purchased these bars via Amazon, they were actually shipped directly from CarbSmart, a retailer specializing in low-carb and other restricted-diet foods.  Yes, both the product and the shipping are a little pricey, and the shipping isn't as lightning fast as Amazon's well-oiled operation, but those are quibbles when considering that I can again happily eat candy- and good candy, too- at the movies again!
This pod if for an 'E.S.E.' adapter handle. 'Easy Serve Espresso'.And it is!Try a regular filter handle and you wind up with weak, mostly water, undrinkable liquid. Used correctly, it is the perfect amount for perfect shot.If ILLY is a bit too toasty, try the more mellow Lavazza. Rich and flavorful without too much acidity. Also produces excellent caramel-y crema.If you like to keep regular or decaf on hand for guests, single wrap ESE pods are perfect, no big can to use up quickly.
I do like to eat, but... I am a combination of busy/lazy. Mashing fresh garlic can be messy, smelly and time consuming. Therefore, I believe I am a perfect consumer for this minced garlic product. The garlic bits are big enough to be noticed in soups and stews, but small enough to provide gentle taste for home made garlic bread and salads. In fact, last weekend I used it in olive oil for bread dipping (I made the mix a few hours ahead in order for the garlic taste to soak thru the olive oil, and then added freshly ground parmesan directly before serving; tasted yum!).BTW: Buying this product in bulk (the package contains six shakers), I was concerned about its freshness. However, I needn't have worried. The expiry date was Nov 29, 2012. Secondly, the price of the product on Amazon was excellent, particularly as I purchased it under the Subscribe and Save program. I highly recommend it!
I use garlic a lot when I cook (not only does garlic add a nicer taste to dishes, it is also a pretty healthy addition to one's diet). When I'm motivated, I use the real deal, chop it, crush it, etc. However, sometimes I prefer to take a shortcut. When that is the case, McCormick Minced Garlic does the trick.When I make my broccoli salad, using this product saves me some time, adds a nice taste to the salad, and, I hate to admit it, is awfully easy on me!So, if one is a bit lazy, this is a useful product. It's not the same, of course, as fresh garlic, but it does the job!
I've read that rice bran oil has health benefits most other oils don't have so that's a good thing, but it also has virtually no taste so it doesn't affect the flavor of what you're making.  For delicately flavored dressings, that's a real advantage.The fact that it has a very high smoke point is a joy when saut&eacute;ing something--no more smoky kitchen--and if you're a fan of deep fryers there's no lingering odor after cooking as there is with peanut oil.  I still love olive oil some things, but this is my new favorite for everything where that isn't the appropriate choice.
No kidding.  My wife has been asking me for 40 years why french fried potatoes and other vegetables never turned out right.This Tophe Rice Bran Oil is the answer!  French fries that are brown and crispy on the outside and soft and perfect on the inside.  And no greasy mess. No sagging. And the paper towel you use to absorb excess ends up perfectly clean and dry.This oil is a chef's dream.  I only wish I had discovered it 40 years ago!  If you appreciate vegetables and meats that are perfectly fried - look no further.Don't take my word for it.  You have to try it just once - and you will never settle for anything less.Outstanding oil in every respect and super healthy to boot!
I got my order yesterday (prompt delivery) 2/8/2012 and I could not wait to try the oil. So this morning I decided to have an omelette for breakfast. Boy, was I impressed and I am not exaggerating.First, the oil is light and it did not have an after taste. After discovering the blood type diet, I found out that certain oils are not good for my blood type.To add to what other customers have said, this is a great cooking oil with health benefits. I will save my olive oil for cold dressings. Although this half gallon is cheaper(I think its' due to the packaging), I plan to keep the rice bran oil in a dark space until I get a dark bottle to preserve the oil since the shelf life is considered 6-12 months.Cheers to good health!
I like to make my own rubs for meat, fish, pork and poultry. I have always wanted a rub that has a more savory spice than sweet. This and a few other spices does the trick. Now my smoked and bbq meat has an even better taste. You can also use it as a stand alone seasoning.Ingredients read: Celery Salt (salt celery seed), spices (including red pepper and black pepper), and paprika.Also, not as salty as some other types of commercially prepared mixed seasonings.I forgot to add that this is a can spice and it is sturdy, the cap snaps securely and offers, pour, measure and shake ports in the lid. You don't always see cans but more plastic. The lid also comes with an additional seal to prevent opening during shipping. Very well thought out.
"Old Bay Seasoning is named after the Old Bay Line, a passenger ship line that plied the waters of the Chesapeake Bay from Baltimore to Norfolk, Virginia, in the early 1900s. Gustav Brunn's company became the Old Bay Company in 1939, the year he fled Nazi Germany, producing crab seasonings in the unique yellow can container until the company was purchased by McCormick & Co in 1990." WikiThis seasoning mix includes mustard, paprika, celery salt, bay leaf, black pepper, crushed red pepper flakes, mace, cloves, allspice, nutmeg, cardamom, and ginger. I first tasted Old Bay when I went to Baltimore and had some crab. How delicious!  I now use it whenever I make crab cakes. I use the Old Bay recipe I found in an old cookbook. It is delicious, and I suggest you try it.This 6 oz. can will last me for quite awhile. I do suggest you purchase a small can unless you use this everyday.Highly Recommended. prisrob 07-02-13
Many reviewers did not realize and/or did not like that these are randomly selected prior to shipping. The surprise element was a major reason I chose this sampler. The teas I received were Oolong, Pu-er, Jasmine, Lychee Black, China Green, and Tikuanyin Oolong. All of the teas tasted anywhere from decent to quite good, with the China Green being the stand-out. The Lychee Black would be awesome except for a sort of stale, dusty aftertaste. Up front the Lychee is fruity and sweet, quite enjoyable. Seconds after swallowing though it's like you've just licked a dusty old book from someone's basement. Very odd. At any rate, the tins are adorable so when the tea is gone I will probably reuse them, they'd be great for storing buttons, loose change, incense or what-have-you.
In reading the reviews it seems some people have received okay tins and some of us have received smelly, moldy, stale, horrible tasting tea.  I usually read all the negative reviews and I did this time but ordered it any way hoping I'd be one of the lucky ones. Besides I don't know a whole lot about how Chinese teas are supposed to smell or taste.  I smelled every can and some were okay but most had a strange smell that I would call musty.  I figured the proof was in the tasting.  I made a cup of oolong tea, the one Chinese tea with which I am a little familiar and had to throw it out.  It tasted worse than it smelled.  The tins are cute and I almost kept the tea so I could have the tins, but common sense says there is no use keeping something when it smells so strange.
ALTHOUGH I RECEIVED MY SHIPMENT IN A TIMELY MANNER, I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE PRODUCT.  IT TASTES LIKE INSTANT NON-FAT DRY MILK AND NOTHING LIKE SOUR CREAM.  IT MAY BE OK TO USE IN COOKING, BUT NOT ON BAKED POTATOES.  ALSO, IT DOES NOT COME WITH DIRECTIONS.  IF I COULD, I WOULD GIVE IT MINUS 5 STARS, THAT'S HOW DISAPPOINTED I AM.  THE COMPANY MAY BE GOOD AND THEIR OTHER PRODUCTS MAY BE GOOD, BUT NOT THE SOUR CREAM POWDER.
I've been eating Jing Jing Jahe for the past 15 years, even taking some with me when traveling in Indonesia, where it is manufactured.  When you first put a candy in your mouth, you might wonder where the ginger heat is, but don't worry.  After a few minutes your mouth will be enveloped with the most wonderful ginger taste you'll ever experience.  This chewy candy is not for those who do not like "hot" foods, but for ginger affecionados, it's a wonderful treat.
One day I saw these at the store and on a whim decided to buy them for my wife as a treat. The man at the register asked if I had ever tried them before, and I said no. He said &#34;Good...because otherwise you would eat this bag on the way home! They are that good.&#34; I was sort of curious, so I thought why not, and opened the bag when I got to the car. I had one, then another, and could have finished the bag before I got home. I expected something sweet and sugary, but was delighted to find no &#34;sugar shell&#34; and a nice kind of &#34;Oh Wow&#34; feeling as it dissolved in my mouth. My wife is now crazy about these, and I always buy a bag for me &#34;for the ride home&#34;. I am not a candy eater, so I do not consider these candy, I consider them health food!
First, the seller:  SuperOlive.  The way these bottles were padded & packed was amazing.  many times I've received items from other places that were damaged in some way because they just dump the stuff in a box & don't care what happens to it afterwards.  This box, the jaws of life couldn't open it. That's a good thing. I used a scalpel to slice thru.  Also..the shipping was crazy fast.I tried this olive oil in a restaurant not too long ago, & I really loved it!!  Asked the waitress what brand it was & then I went looking for it. Reasonably priced, too.  My other favorite olive oil is Bariani.
Frantoia has been a personal favorite for over 10 years, having a remarkable capacity to resist oxidationand maintain its freshness beyond most olive oils. All-purpose and one of the best values in the world today,versatile, substantive, spicy, zingy, and reliable.Frantoia is fruity, herbaceous and has a pleasant almond aftertaste. It is a blend of three olive varieties:nocellera del belice, cerasuola and biancolilla. It&#8217;s versatile and can be used for cooking, soups, salads anddrizzling over vegetables, cheese, meat, and seafood. Celebrity chef Mario Batali used Frantoia on his FoodNetwork series, Molto Mario. Here&#8217;s the owner's tip for a grilled steak (which he loves with Maker&#8217;s Mark on therocks). &#34;Immediately before serving drizzle a little EVOO and lemon over the grilled steak and sprinkle with seasalt.&#34; Fantastic!
Since reading the other reviews, I decided to try this extra virgin olive oil.  It is subtle and delicious; I keep it in conjunction with another that has a more pronounced olive flavor.  But I can't say enough good things about this seller.  The packaging is done so well, I don't think anything could destroy the contents.  And this is the fastest shipping ever.  I will be visiting Super Olive just to see what else they carry because I'd like to do more business with them.
It's true - this soup has no taste at all.  However,that shouldn't stop you from buying it and adding otherspices to it that will give it some taste.  This is solow sodium, it will not harm your blood pressure, andthat is very good news.  If you are like me, you haveaccidentally not read a label first and ate somethingand then spent the next several hours being really sickbecause the food had so much salt that it drove yourblood pressure up sky high.  This will give you a newchoice of something to eat that you won't have to worryabout.  Get some curry, garlic, pepper, or some otherspices and you can fix the problem of it not having anytaste.  I bought 24 cans of this, and I'm not sorry. NowI have something to eat that won't kill me.
I love cream of mushroom soup especially on a hot day.  Because I am on a sodium restricted diet it's hard to find low sodium soup.  Of course this product doesn't have sodium galore so I'm able to eat it without feeling bad about my sodium intake for the day.  I can add sodium if I need to and the original taste is still there.  I will recommend this to my friends but they aren't on a sodium restricted diet and may not be very receptive to this soup.  For my friends who are on a sodium diet they love it as well.  There are so many things that can be done with this one little can.  Yummy!
I've noticed more and more large lumps of fat arriving in these cans than used to be the case. The chicken meat is also more broken up than it used to be. That said, it still makes a damned fine sandwich or, if you want to get really creative, you can do what I do: put it in a pan with ginger beer, sriracha, garlic, soy sauce, lime juice, onions and green herbs to taste. Reduce to a thick sauce and serve on a wrap with lettuce. Yay thai chicken wrap!
This canned chicken is the perfect thing to make a quick salad, sandwhich, or toss into a soup for lunch or dinner.While it will never replace a roast chicken in the oven ready to be served, it's got a nice chicken taste. It's just not as firm as regular chicken you prepared yourself.If you remember to keep a can or two in your desk at work, you won't be without some solid nutrition in a pinch. Try it cold with some yummy salad dressing and a few crackers!Swanson Premium Chunk Chicken Breast is an excellent buy.
I like the convenience of having canned chicken on hand. It's great for soup or salad. However, I found the flavor of the Swanson's canned chicken to be good, however, the texture was so soft, it just seems to mush away into whatever you're making. My kids LOVE chicken salad, and they were so happy to see I had just made some. One taste and they were like, what's this? Why is it so soft, so mushy. I bought a dozen cans, so I have to finish them up and we will be eating mushy chicken salad for awhile. I don't recommend this product.
I use this several times a week for lunch, or part of a lunch, on very rushed days.  It cooks quickly, tastes good, is convenient, and has low calorie count.  My only complaint is from a total of 4 packages, two or three cans of soup (in different boxes) had congealed goop in the bottom.  I suspect this was some issue with them being stored or transferred in an area that was too hot at some point or due to strange settling.  However, I don't like my soup goopy, so when I came across that it ruined my appetite for this product for a while.  I started eating it again and had it happen again so I am not sure what is causing it but I just pay attention when eating it.  It has never made me sick.
This clam chowder is very creamy and tasty. One thing that some people may not like is the fact that unlike all of Campbell's other New England clam chowder's, the Soup at Hand clam chowder has NO chunks of anything what so ever. I am not exaggerating when I say that there is nothing much bigger than a grain of rice in this soup. At first I didn't like the texture of the chowder, but now I kind of like it because all the tiny bits in it makes the seem a bit thicker. If you like big chunks of potato and clams you will not find it here.I believe that the other reviewer that talked about the chunks of potato etc. probably has tried Campbell's other microwavable Clam chowder which does indeed have big chunks, but I don't think that reviewer has eaten the Soup at Hand version of the chowder.
In general, I much prefer the old condensed can varieties to these new "at hand" versions, but this one is the exception.  It is very tasty and the quick and easy preparation is nice when in a hurry.  I found the classic Tomato variety very disappointing (lack of flavor compared to condensed can product), but this one has lots of flavor and is very satisfying.  The other reviews here already cover it pretty well, but I wanted to add my 5 stars vote for this excellent soup.  I have ordered several times now and the quality has been consistent and good.Two thumbs up for this tasty and quick soup.  An excellent quick snack on a cold winters day.
These are soul-warming soups, hot or cold.  My husband actually prefers them cold and drinks them for breakfast, lunch, dinner or late-night snack with total delight.  Great to grab when running off without time to eat, or when planning to be away.  Ideal for travel or emergency stash, because no refrigeration required, not even a microwave for reheating if you're like my husband and enjoy them cold!  We have 2 cases a month on Subscribe-and-Save and go through them pretty fast.  Their nutritional profile isn't as bad as you might think (at least according to Weight Watchers), and they're very satisfying.  If you're craving a late-night snack, think:  would you be better off with cookies/candy/chips or with tomato soup??  I love that these are just as convenient as those usual snack culprits!!
But I swear it's "soup on the go" not broth in a cup. The broth is EXTREMELY bland. I had to put hot sauce in it ro actually be able to take the taste. I got the chicken noodle one and it sucks. I eventually got used to the taste, but there wasn't any chicken inside. Nasty slimy carrots , which wasn't mentioned on the can, ew. And all the noodles sank to the bottom, and are basically impossible to get out after the broth is gone.Good thing I only bought two, I actually might buy again just because it was easy and quick. Just add your own seasoning and its basically edible. That'll be my "in a rush" and I dont care what I eat type soup. Other than that, I'll stick to their bowls. They actually have chicken inside their chicken noodle soup.
I have tried other flavors of the Campbell's Soup at Hand and did not like them.  To me they do not taste like the soup they are supposed to be duplicating, nor did they have the same texture.  However, the cream of broccoli hits the mark.  It tastes just like the original.  It's creamy and delicious (and very difficult to find in the stores around my area, so I was glad to find it here).  If you like the taste of the cream of broccoli soup by Campbell's made from a can where you add water, then you will like this. It tastes the same, just more convenient.
I bought this product for one reason only: to accompany my grilled cheese sandwiches!For me, regular cans of soup just have way too much soup for a meal with one grilled cheese sandwich, but not quite enough to split in half and still have a satisfying amount.  The soup at hand servings are perfect.  The taste is creamy, the consistency is smooth...it pretty delicious for something that comes in a can.Downsides: For a small container of soup, it sure packs a punch of your suggested daily sodium intake (~30%) and it has more calories than I expected (190 cals).  In the future, I would rather get the classic tomato soup and make it creamy on my own by adding a dollop of sour cream (or better yet, greek yogurt) for a much lower calorie, but still creamy, tomato soup.
This soup is pretty good.There is nothing wrong with it.I only wish it could be slightly thicker.. If you use one or two cans of this soup in a big bowl, it should be thicker and not so watered down.Add some salt, pepper, and tabasco, and you have an extremely tasty meal that takes a coupe of minutes to heat up. I don't heat up in the metal/plastic container. I pour everything into a microwave save bowl, then heat it up half way, then stir, then continue. (Total time is about 3-4 minutes on 1000 watt microwave)... I'm not kidding you. You add in the salt, pepper, and tabasco like they do in restaurants, and you can't tell the difference between this stuff, and the stuff they make on fisherman's wharfs. No joke.4/5 stars because it should be thicker. But what a deal!
Campbells Creamy Chicken Soup at Hand is especially tasty when you need it: if you have no appetite, are getting a cold, or feel the flu coming on! These soup at hand ready to serve soups are extreme comfort when you, or someone you love, is just not at the top of their game! When I just can't face a meal, this creamy chicken soup is perfect for making me feel better - plus it gives a sick person something tasty to wash down all those meds, syrups, and other yucky stuff. And hot soup is so soothing when fighting a cold, flu, or just the "under the weather" feeling. This creamy chicken flavor is extra tasty for the amount of calories, too! Recommended!Calories 130 (per unit)4 grams protein890 mg sodium13 carbs9 grams fatwith 62% of calories from fat (which is ok when this is all you can have)
As a consumer, it is my right to know what ingredients are in the products I buy. I find it very DECEPTIVE that Campbells products do NOT LIST upfront WHAT THE INGREDIENTS ARE IN EACH OF THEIR PRODUCTS. So, you have to go online elsewhere and lo and behold; SUGAR IS IN THE FIRST INGREDIENTS!!!!!!! Consumers beware that sugar is the NUMBER ONE ADDITIVE used by Campbells and it is the NUMBER ONE ADDICTIVE substance that people suffer from.  Read labels. Campbells ought to know better to be upfront--- and stop loading up the consumers with sugar instead of REAL TOMATO, pure vegetable ingredients. And, in case anyone wants to be informed, there are many DECEPTIVE LABELS MANUFACTURERS USE TO call sugar AND THEY ARE ALL THE SAME CHEMICALLY; SUCH AS DEXTROSE, MALTODEXTRIN, SUCROSE, SUCRALOSE, CORN SYRUP, ORGANIC sugar (I love this one, so it is made without fertilizers,---- NOTHING IS HEALTHY ABOUT SUGAR)
I like the flavor of this soup. It has only 150 calories per container and just the right amount of salt. It is a creamy chicken soup with little bits of chicken. Different then the familiar cream of chicken soup or chicken noodle soup. More like a bisque.The major downside is the container! The company redesigned it at some point and about a quarter of the time the container will fall over in the microwave. I've tried it in 3 different microwaves. My home one which is very old and has a spinning plate does OK, but the two on campus have both had huge spills happen. One has a spinning plate and one doesn't spin; both times using them, the cup made a popping sound and fell over, making a giant mess and wasting all the soup. I was following all directions on the container so it wasn't user error.
For the price, these things are overpriced I think.  Sure they are healthy and look cool, but that comes at a price.  The soup is actually decent, and I like sipping the broth after I eat soup so this was why I tried this.  Only takes about 1 minute in the microwave and your good to go.  The only downfall to these cups is that even though I mixed it up good after microwaving, the noodles stay on the bottom once you are done sipping it.  But if I can save these cups and put regular soup in for the future, I guess that would be cool.  But I don't think you can dishwasher these cups.  2 stars for the taste and nothing else.  3 stars less because of price, noodles, and size.
This is my all-time favorite Campbell's Soup.  I was looking for one of their "At Hand" soups so I would have the convenience of using the microwave and having no dirty dishes.To add some sticking-power and extra protein to this flavor-packed soup, I add someKraft Grated Parmesan, 8 Ounce Cannister (Pack of 12)to the top and after a few bites (no, I don't use the sippy lid although one could) I shake more into the cup and stir it in.  I know it's not Parmigiano Reggiano but, hey, it's microwaved soup.I like the Cream of Broccoli soup so much that I doubled-up on my subscription.
Excellent product, that would be a good "just because" gift to almost anyone you care about.Seniors, college kids, or anyone who might need a bit of comfort food.  Not sure if it can easily be sent to the troop's, but I am sure it would be welcome.I first found this product on a film set, when it turned up at a craft service table on a late-night shoot.It was a hit,and I have been hooked ever since.  Outstanding product!
I never expect a lot from microwavable soup cups or bowls. I'm happy if their reasonably edible and are not gunky or too thin. It's a nice surprise when a soup tastes not just edible but very tasty! This creamy tomato parmesan from Campbells is nice ans smooth with just the right hint of cheese and cream. It's a perfect combo for a grilled cheese sandwich or a piece of crusty bread. I've also mixed in some crushed red pepper flakes to spice it up and that works well.Texture: 5/5Taste: 4/5Consistency: 5/5Repeatability: 5/5Total quick lunch score: an excellent 5/5!
I love having something quick and tasty (enough) on hand at work to heat up for lunch when I forget, or a snack on the days I'm extra hungry! However, the top is all broth and the bottom all noodles! Since I have to use a spoon anyway I prefer to have soup in a bowl, so the convenience of this is really negated.. still.. It's pretty tasty for a canned soup and I'll probably keep having one on hand for the occasions I have nothing else.
I really cannot believe I even bought this, but I did and it works really well. I went to low processed foods recently and switched to the more &#34;natural&#34; commercial peanut butters too.This gadget makes mixing it a breeze. But better yet, nut butters taste so much better evenly mixed. There is no way I could get the natural peanut butters anywhere near as creamy with a butter knife. This helps get it there and again the taste is better.Thanks to the infamous reviewer, Joseph Z. Rukaj, on compiling the product numbers and their associated dimensions! I got the right sized lid first time out, now I am married to the brands that fit this lid.
I think this invention is amazing - it stirs my peanut butter without the mess and in half the time that using a spoon would.  I can't believe I didn't know about it earlier in life!I took off 1 star because the lid does not fit my 16oz Kroger Natural peanut butter jars.  I just hold the lid on and stir while pushing down on the top.  The lid fits great on the 16oz Marnatha almond butter jars I buy.  I know the company makes other sizes, but since this is the one I ordered (touted as the "most common"), I will make do.
I use this with 16oz jars of Stop & Shop Natural Peanut Butter - it fits them perfectly.  I would think that it would fit most standard 16oz jars of peanut butter.  It works exactly as described.  It makes mixing natural peanut butter quick, easy and mess free.  It's very easy to use!  Cleanup is also easy... I was shocked, but it does actually clean the rod almost pefectly when you remove it from the lid.  There's also a thin, removable, plastic inner lid which is a breeze to clean.  Do be sure to lube the mixing rod with either peanut oil or olive oil prior to use, as per the instructions.
Unless you are buying your peanut butter fresh ground in the little plastic tubs or some smaller brand, you probably get one of the Smucker's/Laura Scudder's jar from your super market. This fits those perfectly and greatly simplifies/enhances the mixing experience. It does a much better job than I had with a butter knife or a plastic chopstick, not to mention the mess it avoids. I would even say it made the peanut butter taste better since the consistency throughout the jar was more even from the mixing. To store and protect the device, I just saved one of the empty jars and keep it on there in the cupboard. That way, too, my wife will remember what it's for and not toss it in the next garage sale. ;-)
I love this mixer!  I don't want to eat peanut butter with sugar and lard in it, so I buy the natural but the peanut oil does separate in peanut butter that's just peanuts. It can be quite oily and splash when I've stirred it with a spoon.  This mixer fits on the top of the jar, mixes the peanut butter to a perfect consistency that stays mixed until the jar is empty. When you pull the mixer wand out of the peanut butter, it automatically cleans itself so you don't lose any peanut butter. You replace the original jar top, and put the mixer away.  I've also learned that the Witmer company sells this mixer for the 26oz jars of peanut butter also.
These are larege tea bags, with about twice as much in them as in Alvita or Seelect fennel tea bags.  When I brewed up a cup according to the instructions, it was just too strong for my taste.  Maybe you like your tea strong or need it that way for your condition.  After trying it several times, I concluded it was just too much for me and went back to other brands.  They leave me feeling much better than this does.  For those who would need or enjoy it, I'm sure it would be very good.
I place my order on Janaury 23 for the noodles.  Due to overwhelming demand the supplier ran out and I had to wait for restocking.  Once the item was restocked, 2/9, I was sent an E-mail with a link to UPS.  After a few days, 2/13, the status of my package went from "receiving billing information" to "exception".  The package was damaged in transit and has yet to be replaced, it's now 2/23.  Seller is so-so about responding to communication (they usually respond it's just they are not quick about it) and until I actually receive the product, I am very hesitant to use this seller again.
I purchased 3 types of these noodles at my regular grocery store in the refrigerated area where tofu is sold. The package says "Keep Refrigerated", so it is a little puzzling that these can be sold and then shipped with no refrigeration.  The cost per 2-serving bag was $1.99, and there were two modest portions in the bag.  Upon opening the bag, I smelled a rather strong, somewhat fishy order.  I immediately strained and rinsed the noodles, then I placed them in a pan with some expeller-pressed peanut oil and warmed them (they didn't brown). I decided to add some canned bean sprouts (1/2 large can, drained), Guilin hot chili sauce, water, garlic powder, and coconut sap sugar (3 - 4 tsp.)It tasted pretty good.
Quick rinse and eat like ramen.  I personally cooked it up for 10 mins in flavored broth, added my veggies and meats and it is exactly like ramen.  The only difference is, you don't digest it, it just comes out looking exactly the same as it looked coming in meaning, no digestion! Chaching!  Weight loss! The other brands are more rubbery, this one really has the exact texture of ramen, just don't let other bad reviews mess with your head, it's really not bad at all.
I very much wanted to like tofu shirataki noodles. Unfortunately, they are just a little too unusual for my taste. They're not awful, but the texture is very slippery and chewy. As was mentioned in other reviews, even after rinsing and soaking they still have a distinctive smell and taste. A sesame-soy based sauce seems to compliment the shirataki noodles best. (i.e., masks the taste) Spaghetti sauce just doesn't taste right with it. Since this product is not available locally and has to be shipped from New York to Texas at a net cost of about $5 a package, I would be very unlikely to purchase it again.
When I first cut open the bag and have this miracle shiritaki noodle washed the smell of it was very mild like salmon after that I boiled it for a good 3 minutes then run it down with cold water then I put it on a flat plate to patted dry with a paper towel once it is dry I cook it with some recipes I got on YouTube  the flavor of the sauce and other stuff I cook with was good however chewing on the noodles was like biting down on a rubber band and it was difficult for me to even swallow the noodles down soon after that I threw it back up after that I threw it all the noodles away even I though I wasted my money on this noodle it is not worth trying I don't recommend it !
It tastes like a Black Russian when properly diluted. I was hoping for more of a milk chocolate taste. It also comes in a plastic bottle rather than a glass bottle which I didn't like. But I tell you what, if you take 1/3 shot of this and add 1 shot of vodka and 1 shot of water and pour that over ice you get a dandy Black Russian.Also I found out that if you mix 1 part of this syrup with 9 parts of Da Vinci Vanilla syrup, you get a combination that tastes *exactly* like a chocolate sundae when diluted. VERY tasty!
I'm new to Veg lifestyle and dishes, but had to give thes a try and was very pleased with the ease of preparation and with the taste.  Though probably not exact, to me, they tasted very similar to chicken tenders.  I coated six in flour and fried as suggested, then I dipped them in ketchup which is probably cheating, but they were very tasty.  I would love to experiement with them and add spices and such to give them an extra zing, but they are very tasty and filling as is.  Amazon delivered very quickly.  They seem a little pricey at a little less than $4 a can, but I guess they go far, with six cooked, being 1/4 or 1/3 of a can.  I highly receommend them.
This is one of those products that should be a staple in everyone's closet.  Right beside the Ritz and the Nabisco Premium Saltines.  I LOVE the buttery taste of these crackers and have been using them for about 35 years.  My parents before that always had them in the house. The one thing that can be a challenge is that I don't recommend that you put them in a bowl of canned soup.  The canned soup is usually overly salty anyway and these, well, they're a bit heavy on the salt as well.  If so, be sure to have steady access to water because you'll feel like you just consumed the Dead Sea!  Anyway, these crackers are best served with dips and made into appetizers.  They are quite buttery so if you think that might not work for you, try the Ritz.  They have a bit less butter and have a bit richer flavor.Great product, highly recommend!
Delivery was fine, no broken crackers, no stale product. Well packed, lots of air packages.I just am not that enthused about Club crackers. I had them many years ago, saw them on here and thought I'd give them a try again, but turns out I don't really care for them any more.4 crackers for 70 calories seems a bit high also, although I really haven't done any research into this. That might be average or even low, but I was hoping for fewer. Perhaps crackers aren't in my future!Got a good price too, $8.50 on subscribe and save, but I think I won't keep this subscription.Ha, sorry for the boring review, but I am just not enthused about these.
Club crackers have arrived FRESH, in good shape at less than twelve bucks - a good deal! It's getting too hot to bake bread at home so crackers are on the summer menu. The hors d'oeuvres style goodies on crackers along side salads have been a hit with the family as a change of pace. The teens enjoy making peanut butter and jelly whip for a sweet cracker treats. It never fails that good old cheese and crackers are TV treats too. All-in-all versatility and variety relatively on the cheap :)
Stocked up on crackers at the excellent Amazon Grocery price in anticipation of the holiday parties and drop-in guests. Simple snack to have on hand for soups, cheese, and dips. Who doesn't love the buttery goodness of a Club Cracker.  Seriously, just good. No problems in shipping, arrived in great conditioned and wrapped in plastic. If you like to buy in bulk (or are expecting a house full this holiday season), this pack of four will serve you well. Pricing, shipping, and quality all great. Enjoy!
For people avoiding sugar, Murray Sugar Free Cookies Oatmeal, are good enough! This whole thing about sugar free products got me intrigued and confused at the same time. Some products that advertised as being sugar free have a lot of other sources of sugar, like alcohol, that are high. The feeling I get with Murray's is that they are reliable in their claims. I see them in all sorts of reputable publications and that gives me encouragement regarding their advertisement. As to the taste I can say they are pretty good tasting. Have tried their other ones and this one and the chocolate are the ones I favor. Who am I? Hungry hungry all the time for sweets but I realize not all sugar free items are created equal. For now a decent 4 stars rating!
It is hard to believe these are sugar free. They are so good. They are buttery and rich tasting and a serving is 8 cookies of 130 calories. That is so filling and yet still keeps you on whatever plan you are following.I have tried many of the flavors of these cookies and not found one to be bad or have an aftertaste. This one is my all time favorite. You will not be disappointed. In my town they are usually $3.99 a pack so this is a fantastic deal.They come with a long expiration date also.
My favorite uncle is diabetic, and I always feel awful when I invite him for my birthday and he can't join in on eating cake with the rest of us. I picked up a package of these and used them for a cookie crust on a cream pie withJell-O Sugar-Free Instant Pudding & Pie Filling, Chocolate, 1.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24)and whipped cream lightly sweetened with non-sugar sweetener. The result was gorgeous and tasted pretty good even to those of us who can have sugar. For him? He told me "You know I can't have sugar." and when I told him it was sugar free he dug in with gusto. He said "It's not even my birthday and I feel like I got the best present."It was so easy to make, and the crust was his favorite part. I gave him an extra package of cookies I bought and he enjoyed those a lot too.Love these for making it so much easier to make special treats for my uncle.
I used to eat this stuff 10, 20 years ago, can't remember. I do remember it being awesome, and totally delicious, and hard to stop eating, which is why I stopped buying it. I bought a box recently, now that I'm better at portion control, and found, much to my great sadness, that it tastes totally different. The texture is also different; before it was crunchy and broke apart right away, whereas now it sort of sticks together more and is a lot less crunchy. I found it so much less good that I'm not even eating it, and am trying to slough it off onto my husband, who is less picky about food in general.
Guys: I  do like that the first two ingredients are grains (not sugar), and also that this cereal is really tasty (sort of like a bran, oatmeal and coconut cookie),  but this cereal is double the amount of fat that's in many other breakfast cereals (partially due to the coconut and oil, I'm guessing) and it's also somewhat higher in sugar and calories than what I normally select in a breakfast cereal, so you really may want to keep this to no more than the suggested 6 oz serving.The price using subscribe and save is good (about $3.00/box for the 17 oz size), compared to most supermarkets in NYC (which prices this at $5.99/box if they even carry it).
Thin, crispy, perfectly baked - - the best saltine cracker out there.  The flavor is subtle, the texture is very delicate, and there's not a hint of that &#34;stale&#34; taste most grocery-store saltines are cursed with these days.  Crumble 'em up for a great breading for fish, chicken, or pork chops.  Smash 'em into your soup for a great thickening agent that doesn't overstep the flavor of even the most delicate vegetable-based soups or consomm&eacute;'s.  We used to buy these many moons ago, but they're no longer available in our local grocery stores.  Thanks, Amazon!
I debated a while before ordering these because they are kind of fragile, but my shipment had no problems. Ha, maybe I'd trust Amazon and UPS more than the people they've got working down at the grocery store.Another reason I debated ordering was of course, the salt, and of course being "SALTines", there's a bunch of it. I haven't compared a lot of other snacks, but strangely enough these have less salt that other alternatives. I guess because there's no other tastes that they have to mask, the little bit of salt the do have comes right on through. I don't normally worry about such things as health and nutrition, but 12 boxes is a lot, and I tend to chow down on a lot of them because they're so good!Plenty of time left on the expiration date, 8 months from now, so that's not a worry.Prices, as with everything, fluctuate, but I got a good deal.
I enjoy Redi Burger. It comes in a loaf; so, you have to open both ends of the can, loosen the edges with a knife and push it out. It has a softer texture than it did some years ago. You have to slice it and then pan fry it in some oil. It is very delicious and tastes a little like spam to me. It also has the absolutely delicious smell of Morningstar Farms vegetarian bacon - but you have to really think about it to detect it. It's great on burgers or sliced and topped with gravy. I grew up on meat analogues and enjoy most of Worthington's products.
My wife picked up a pack of Kellog's Special K Bars (blueberry variety). I'm not sure why because both of us tend to avoid such products. I guess maybe they're for the baby, because he's the one who's getting them. He likes them, of course. After he's done with his main meal, he often says "bar'" as if asking for a little desert treat and I know exactly what he means. He wants one of the Special K Bars. Well, OK, but I' somewhat against giving him this kind of "candy" food. One thing is certain, he likes the bars and one bar will calm him down.Gary Peterson
Alas, while I was grocery shopping at my nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market, I noticed a "New" tag on some Keebler Grasshopper Fudge Mint Cookies. Well, I can't resist trying something like this so I picked up a 10-ounce package and had some for dessert with the evening meal. They were excellent and I ended up eating too many of them. The package was nice and fresh. The cookies had a nice bite to them and you could taste the fresh mint immediately. Perhaps it was a mint fragrance that did it. The exteriors were an excellent milk chocolate. I might have preferred a darker chocolate, but the total taste of the cookies was quit good. I'll be back for more but, hey, mercy, let's wait a couple months.Gary Peterson
In the past, Keebler was the maker of "Thin Mints" for the Girl Scouts of America.After Keebler lost the license to make GSCs, they bought Little Brownie Bakers, one of the 2 remaining licensees.So, rest asured, these are a great way to get your fix between fundraisers.Remember, broken cookies and crumbs have no calories, so it's OKay to subscribe-n-save a 6-pack of these every month, right?*Edited 2011-03-01 to correct Keebler licensee status based on comments*
We really like these &#34;meat&#34; balls--they are good with or without sauce.  I would order more if the price could somehow be lower--I used to purchase by the case from a local health food store not that long ago for considerably less (unfortunately they closed).  They are now available in our local grocery store--the per can cost is considerably less than when I purchase by the case.  If this could be reevaluated, you would definitely have a faithful (and repeat) customer for these and other canned vegetarian products.
The only problem with Tender Rounds is that I tend to eat them right out of the can while I am cooking! They are delicious and so easy and quick. I put them in spaghetti sauce, I serve them as sandwiches on toasted rolls, I serve them over noodles in a brown gravy... the list goes on and on. Add them to soups, to Rice A Roni dishes, too, and get a nice protein boost to your meal. A wonderful inexpensive meal in our house consists of dried Chinese noodles (NOT fried Ramen noodles, but unfried noodles that we get at a local Chinese supermarket) cooked with a can of Tender Rounds, including their gravy. A little seasoning, a little hot chili sauce.... mmmm. Tastes great, costs little and opens up congested sinuses to boot!
