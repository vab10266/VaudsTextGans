I purchased the Trilogy with hoping my two cats, age 3 and 5 would be interested.  The 3 yr old cat was fascinated for about 15 minutes but when the same pictures came on, she got bored.  The 5 year old watched for about a few minutes but then walked away. It is possible that because we have a wonderful courtyard full of greenery and trees and one of my neighbors has a bird feeder, that there is enough going on outside that they prefer real life versus a taped version.  I will more than likely pass this on to a friend who has cats that don't have as much wildlife to watch as mine do.
My Rottie has food allergies to poultry, beef and dairy. I've had a difficult time finding a toothpaste that doesn't make him allergic and he enjoys the taste. This toothpaste is peanut flavor (smells like black licorice). He loves the taste and doesn't wiggle as much when I brush his teeth every night. The price is ok, but I do wish that the tube came in a larger size. Soooo, if your pup has allergies or doesn't like his/her current toothpaste you might want to try this one.
my dog like his kibbles more than treats (he LOVES to eat!!), and with this sprinkled on top of his food,he refuses to eat. the smell is super strong even I pull away my head when I open the jar.And, even when i hand fed him the food, he still tried to play with his poop.  (granted, he consumed smaller portion than the recommended by the direction)Overall, it may keep dogs away from their poop because they can smell this in their poop, but that same smell is present on their food, which obviously repells them.So, I do not recommend this product unless your dog eats EVERYTHING.
This product didn't work for my dogs at all, and the smell of it was difficult to put up with (for me). It smelled like a Christmas candy cane gone all wrong. I put it in front of them on their (dry) food, I've never seen two dogs so sad to eat their food in my life. My dogs usually chow down their food really fast. Eventually I started mixing it with a bit of pumpkin to make it more tolerable for them. In the end thogh, it didn't work and my only solution seems to be keep an eye on them like a hawk when they're out (in the fenced on yard) and dispose of the poop within a minute of it hitting the ground.
I bought this product to stop the problem we were having with our 6 month old puppy. We have 5 little dogs that are paper trained. The product smells horrible to me, enough to make my stomach turn. I mixed it with canned food and all but one dog really loved it. I forced myself to tolerate the smell and continued to feed it to them for a couple of weeks once a day. It has helped to stop the problem even though one dog wouldn't eat it. I have stopped it for about a week now and it still seems to be working. I have my fingers crossed because I really don't want to smell it as I feed it anymore.
We've owned a whole set of these for our dogs and cats; they've never broken, warped, or discolored in all the years we've had them. They stack great in pantries and feature a space for locks if you have an animal that may try to help themselves. They've survived beach trips, time outdoors, and one really naughty standard poodle pulling a full one to the floor. We've also used one to store extra cat litter and another wild bird seed.Their only bad feature is they are not air or water tight; they will keep food fresh for sure but not like an unopened bag. I'd recommend you be able to use any food in them within a month or two. If you have a dog with allergies to storage mites you will want to either wash these bins between bags or choose a bin that is air tight.
I just received this product and I ordered it for my dog&#8217;s food. I bought a 30 pound bag that I&#8217;ve been using and then filled in this container but it over flowed! (My dog eats Natures Recipe for adults) So right of the back a little FYI. Also the door for closing has a little snapped and it has a place on top to put a lock. Since mine was full the door is snapping back open.I ordered this product because it looked convenient to take the food out and I liked the container size. The size is the only reason why I&#8217;m thinking about keeping it but I&#8217;m not 100% sure right now.
I have one of these that I have had for years and love it. Wanted to order another and needed the one that will hold 40lbs. In the title this one states Size: 40lbs.  However....this one is TINY and no way that it will hold 40lbs. In the further description it says that it holds 27-29lbs (which I didn't read as I stopped at the title) but I am hesitant to believe that it even holds that much.  So if you are looking to put a 15lb bag of food in this...no problem.That is the only reason for the one star.  Other than that the product is great for it's purposes.  It is not intended to be air tight.  It is easily opened with an arm full of dishes, etc.
The trouble with Glucosamine/Chondroitin supplements is that some of them work and some of them don't. And sometimes a brand that has worked stops working. So far CosaminDS works. I hope the manufacturer doesn't try to increase their profit by reducing the active ingredients. So far it's the most effective Glucosamine/Chondroitin I've tried.Edit: They work better than any other supplement I have tried. But best to order them in the cool months, so they don't spend the several days in above 100degrees.
My dogs veterinarian recommended that I try this product a few years ago.  I have been taking it ever since.I have had surgery twice on one knee and I had a lot of pain.  It took many months before I felt any difference at all, but eventually I noticed my knee was not hurting! What a relief!Now I can walk a few miles with no pain at all.  If I do get a little selling or stiff, I ice for 15 minutes, and just put on a salonpas patch and I am fine in 10 minutes.  Happy days...If my review helped you, can you please take a moment and click on the "helpful" button? Thanks! :)
I have had littermaids for about 10 years. In those 10 years, I have had two of them in which they work awesome. I have 4 cats, and its awesome just having to dump the plastic waste holder out every day, or every other day and not have to worry about litter all over the place and scooping. I have my current unit in a closet, and with 4 cats it has worked great for the last two years! !Once the plastic lid and waste holder get a little worn, litter can fall between the crack which can be a pain, but I try to open the waste door carefully and pull the waste holder out gently to ensure the waste holders last a while before I have to replace...When this unit wears out, I will move up to the Elite, which is bigger. But going strong on two years, hopefully it will keep working hard!
My previous Littermaid box was over 4 years old and finally quit (it's used by 2 cats daily).  After checking reviews on the newer Littermaid models, I decided to stay with the LM500 and I don't regret it. The litter box size is a little smaller than the old box, but it works great (my cats each weigh about 7-3/4 lbs, they're small cats, so the size difference wasn't a major problem). I have no regrets getting this model again.  Sometimes I have to scrape the kitty goo from the bottom of the box where it seeps and coagulates, but I had to do that with the old box too. When you change and clean the litter box section, wipe some baby oil on the bottom of the pan before you add new litter, it helps to lift the coagulated kitty goo more easily.
Current version of littermaid does not work well at all. The first one I purchased lasted for five years and I was very happy with it. The pet store only had the larger version when I replaced the original. The larger version lasted for 15 months and then died.I found the old version (on Amazon). It worked for six days and then died. It was replaced at no charge. The second one worked for six weeks and then died. I have been told it is not possible to get my money back because it has been more that 30 days since the original purchase. So now I am out a wad of money and have to run the box manually.DO NOT buy this product. This system forced me to give this product at least one star, I would give it -5 if I could.
Ok, I don't own this, but have thought about it. After discovering arm and hammer cat box deodorizer...I can live without the littemaid. I buy cheap litter because I've heard that clumping litter can be bad for kitties because they lick their paws and it can cause intestinal blockage. I keep the box, garbage bags, the litter and the deodorizer in the closet - every 3rd day or so I just dump the whole box and add new litter and the deodorizer. I do smell it right after the kitties go - but not shortly thereafter. Try this, if you are leary of buying the litter maid.  I rated it a 3 since I have no experience and it seems a lot of people hate this thing!
I should have read the reviews before purchasing.This is incredibly finicky about precise fill level. I must have overfilled by 1/4" or so, because it stopped working properly after the first day. The scooper still scooped but the thing seldom opened the lid of the receptacle.With such shallow litter, my cats had trouble digging and covering.The fact that a scoop is included in the package is informative.I gave it two stars instead of one because the charcoal filter does a good job of odor control. And another clock in the house is always handy.
I've used these for about ten years and I keep a spare on hand because it is just a machine and it will eventually wear out, although I've never had one fail. The receptacles are expensive and difficult to clean, but there's a way to keep things clean and a receptacle can last a year or more. Just purchase a box or roll of 3 or 4 Quart trash bags. Try both to see which suits you best. Then simply put the bag in the receptacle, fold the sides and ends down and put the receptacle in the machine. When the receptacle is full just take out the receptacle, remove the bag with its contents, tie the top in a knot to contain the odor, and put it in the trash. The receptacle remains perfectly clean and can be used until it falls apart. This method has probably saved me many hundreds of dollars over the years and takes all the mess and cleaning out of the process.
I have gone through 2 of these in 5 years.  NEVER again will I purchase a a Littermaid.  This model died Monday after 2-1/2 years, but had been having problems with the rake running continuously until it finally cut off.  The cord finally snapped on Monday.  Not only the short lifespan considering the price, but I found myself spending nearly as much time cleaning the box as I did a regular old litter pan.  No matter what litter brand I tried, it adhered like mud to the bottom of the pan, would stick to the rake, and eventually cause the machine to cut off.Just purchased an Omega Paws, which has very good reviews and am eagerly awaiting its arrival today so the Littermaid can get tossed.Good idea, very poor longterm performance.
I bought this product for $66 at Meijers.  The cats loved it and so did I, for the first 6 hours.  The kitty poo poo stuck to the rake, caused a jam and the entire rotating arm broke in a matter of hours.  I was so bummed. It would have made life so much easier.  Numerous reviews stated that the poos need to dry before they get raked.  This is true! C'mon you engineers.  This is the only product I would advocate animal testing on.  Great idea but a real mess to clean up.  It is getting returned tomorrow.  :(
The plastic rake is spaced in a way that it won't work with my, and my cat's, favorite litter.  Yes it's a clumping litter.  Also the tongs on the rake are very wide.  This litterbox scoops a lot of clean litter into the bin (even with the smallest clumping litter I could find).  It wastes a LOT of litter, pretty much just indiscriminately scooping everything in it's path into the bin... more of a shovel, than a rake IMO.  In order to not waste more litter than is used, I would have to dump out the bin and scoop that in order to save the wasted clean litter.... far more of a hassle than useful.I would not repurchase this item, nor would I recommend it to a friend.... an enemy.... maybe.
I left a review regarding Petmate Purrforma jumbo, it was a smelly,horrible mess. Well, I got lucky. My PetSmart told me to bring the Purrforma back and they would credit all toward a new Littermaid and supplys for it. There was even enough credit left for 2 30# bags of the Nutro dog food I use. The Puurforma is so overpriced as well as poorly designed. I had the receipt for the Puurforma from the month before. I now have my 3rd multicat Littermaid and am very happy again. While not perfect, as litter cleaning will never be perfect, these do work well for me. I have one in the laundry room, one downstairs and the other at my farm. I have yet to find a cat that will not use this box. My cats at home are all over 10 years old. At the farm they are 2 years and younger. Hope this helps.
This is my second one. I will always use the self cleaning litter box. It is healthier for your cat(s), easier on me and keeps your home cleaner. I live in an apartment and my manager complemented me on how "well I care for my cats". My vet says my 14 year old cat looks 7 and I firmly believe this litter maid has something to do with it. He has had the litter main most of his life. My "skid-dish" cat, he uses all the time but waits to see it move, kind of funny. All I know is when this one goes, I will buy a new one again. These are worth every penny I spend to have another day with my cats.
Pros:Keeps litter better contained. It falls inside the tent or right in front of the entrance, instead of all over the room.Gives the cats privacy.Keeps the smell down a bit.Cons:It's difficult to get the zipper closed.The litterbox doesn't fit out the entrance easily (and unzipping it is out of the question).It's difficult to reach inside and scoop out clumps that the littermaid rake missed (and it misses lots of clumps, so I have to deal with this problem 3-4 times a day).
The tent is made of two parts assembled with a zipper, that fit around a structure made of flimsy hollow plastic rods. The problem lies in the structure, which is not strong enough to withstand the weight of an average cat. If your cat likes exploring and climbing on top of things like most cats do, the frame will break quickly.If you're minimally handy, you can very easily make yourself a much better structure using PVC piping and joints (they're inexpensive and can be found in the plumbing section of any hardware store). If your cat is heavy and a climber, I would strongly suggest not even bothering with the supplied frame and building your own right away.Another irritating problem is that replacing the waste receptacles is extremely inconvenient when the littermaid is in the tent.All in all, unless you absolutely have to hide the littermaid, this tent is poorly designed and more trouble than it's worth.
I have been using the Cat Tent for years to cover my Littermaid Mega.Pros:  provides coverage, privacy to the animals and offers some degree of odor control.  Does not retain odor.Cons: Fits too tight, which causes the zipper to break and fail.  Vinyl also discolors after 6 months or so and it can pick up stains fairly easily.  COst is also a con - this thing along with all LitterMaid products is too expensive.Overall, I have owned several of these.  Eventually, they start to look bad on the exterior and the zipper will fail.  That's really all I can say about it.
I am fairly disappointed with this after being so pleased w/the stand.  The tent is short and most cats like stand up straight to poo.  Also, the velcro already attached (not nearly enough to do anything) to the tent releases when attached to the velco pad we must attach to the stand.  Lastly the tent is to help keep the litter from spreading, which this does not do.  there are only four 1-inch patches of velcro, the rest is open for the litter to fall all around the unit.  Don't waste your $$ on this accessory.
I waited over a year to review this item to make a proper review.  The plastic is of that of a grill cover or patio furniture cover.  The PVC frame that came with it didn't fit properly so my husband used a saw to modify it to be assembled correctly which was disappointing.  It doesn't keep any smell inside and is simply used to avoid making eye contact with your cat while they are using it.  I threw the bottom portion away since it was too much trouble to zipper the thing on and off when I did thorough cleaning.  Not a fan
Cheap 'n' cheezy, just like all the newer LitterMaid receptacles are.  Sure wish they would bring back the older, sturdier ones.  Really makes you feel like a captive market, since you don't have much choice but to use these if you want to use the LitterMaid.  I line them with bags, but the receptacles are so thin that they crack and split after about 3-4 uses just from putting them into and taking them out of the LitterMaid, so have to be replaced despite being lined.
These receptacles offer poor value for the money, and are constructed of very cheap, flimsy plastic.Pros:Necessary for LitterMaid self-cleaning litter boxes.Cons:Cheap & flimsy plastic.Do not fit tightly.Too small.Do not keep out odor.Poor customer support.If you have a LitterMaid self-cleaning litter box; you'll have little choice but to purchase these. They function reasonably well at collecting cat waste, but are poorly designed. The problem is that they're made of very flimsy plastic and the design makes it impossible to get a tight fit when placing them in the LitterMaid box. The charcoal filter does virtually nothing to eliminate odors, and with the lack of a tight fit, the odors are very noticeable. In addition; this company has poor customer support.
I agree these are somewhat expensive - I wish they'd improve these by making it easier to lift a full one out to throw away.  I don't know if that's something on the littermaid itself that should be improved, or the design of these to include a handle of something on each side that sticks up so you can pull a heavy/full one up and out of the box.  I recently tried a petmate that has a reusable plastic receptacle to which you place little baggies made for it, and its very much similar sized to these receptacles. Returned that terrible box and went back to the littermaid but I have a few extra of the baggies and I am going to try putting them into this receptacle.  They are designed to lift out and cover/tie all in one and that's the only thing I liked about the petmate btw.
I find that the Littermaid works very well for what it is designed to do. The only truly unpleasant task is changing these waste receptacles. The difficulty I seem to experience is inserting a new receptacle. It is difficult to get the thin retaining lip on the tray itself securely under the plastic flanges attached to the litter box which retain the tray. Once it is in place, it works like a champ, but in a future redesign, I hope that the good folks that design this fine line of electric self-cleaning cat boxes will develop a more secure retaining method that facilitates easier receptacle changeout.
The receptacles I got with my first Littermaid (for multiple cats) were very flimsy. The replacement box of 12 (as shown) I got afterward were also flimsy.  This did not stop us from reusing the trays over and over.  It doesn't make sense not to, but eventually they get pretty brutalised from removal and reinsertion.Oddly enough, when we got our second LitterMaid (regular sized) the receptacles that came with it were sturdier and more durable.  Why they arent all manufactured at this thickness is beyond me.  Actually, I'm sure it's a case of trying to get more money out of us at cheaper manufacturing cost, but it's a little ridiculous when they are that flimsy.
There are three main problems with this product. The first is that it does not fit the littermaid box well at the base (where the box fits into the botoom). As a result you end up with some cat litter on the floor as a result, instead of all of it in this product. Secondly, the top part does not fit into the top well. Some effort required to get it in properly. Thirdly, the product is made of very weak plastic. As a result, if it is filled up, it bends quite a bit (to the point where it makes handling a chore). Higher quality/harder plastic should have been used to avoid this problem.
First, the noise level is low.  Nothing that's going to drive humans crazy.  Second, the Wiggly Giggly Ball is everything it promises to be.  Tough, makes low-level noise, and requires no batteries.  Love that.  Though my current dog didn't go bonkers over this ball, I've had dogs who loved batting them about.  My dog is into noisy toys but not balls so much.  But I'd still recommend the Wiggly Giggly Ball for its quality and durability.
This "wiggly giggly" ball was very disappointing.  I ordered the first one that seemed to be defective, which of course amazon was quick to replace.  The second one came and was no better than the first one.  It would only make those cute little noises if I shook it like a crazy person, but as soon as I would roll it for my little dog, it went mute.  He lost interest in it pretty fast after that so it went back.  I would have kept it for just a regular ball for him but at almost $12, I thought that was a little pricey for a do nothing ball.
At first it looked like it was going to work great (when the litter was clean). After a day or so, it wasn't cleaning very well. I got better litter and it started working better, but still not great. Litter gets in the crevices and gets stuck to the rake. After about two weeks of use, the rake stopped moving backwards. I tried to fix it, but it just won't go in reverse. Overall, this was a big waste of time and money. I'm not even going to try to get another one. A good old fashioned litter box with good clumping litter is less work than trying to get this thing to work properly while keeping it clean. It's too bad as it had a promising beginning. DO NOT BUY.
I like hiking with my dog and purchased this collapsible bowl for our outdoor excursions.I also use it whenever I take him to the vet or in the car. Dogs over heat in this weather very quickly, carrying water is essential.This bowl is handy and easy to slip into your pocket, just put it on a flat surface and fill it with water or food.My dog hasn't gotten the opportunity to chew it because I take it away as soon as he's finished.This is one of the more sturdier bowls I've found and I'm very satisfied with it.
I was betrayed by a dog "expert" that swears by these that they're the greatest thing ever.  I suspect Planet Dog has in fact betrayed them by letting their quality control slip.  The green parts are glued on, but not very well.  I don't leave any toys with my dog unsupervised but my puppy ripped Australia off and swallowed it in only a minute of play.  Several of the other continents are peeling off and hanging my a thread.  I felt like returning the ball with the green piece, poop and all.
Like other Planet Dog toys, this ball is good, but not the best.  The knot in the rope comes undone quickly, so you will have to tie it again.  Also, if you have a constant chewer/mouther on balls (and don't just use it for fetching), the outer shell of the ball can come apart off of the inner shell that has the continents on it.  But that is usually after lots and lots of chewing.  Other than that, my dogs LOVE these balls.  They love the softness and the chewability.
Got this as a 'present' for my roommate's dog because her old toy was destroyed. Figured it'd be safe because my own dog is really particular about her toys, and so I'd only get one.That was a mistake. The instant I pulled the toy out both dogs wee enthralled, and are now engaged in a very long game of hide-and-seek/ keepaway. I'm pretty positive I will be ordering another monkey in the immediate future.The sock monkey version of this toy is a nice soft plush with that doesn't have 'long hair' or anything - it just feels like, well, a soft cotton sock. It's a good size and the limbs are different shapes/widths, which is great because that means dogs with any type of muzzle can pick it up and run with it.I highly recommend this to anyone who's looking for new all purpose puppy toys. We fetch, play tug of war and chase with this toy- it's brilliant!
My 20 month old German Shepherd shredded Mr. Bill in less than two weeks. Oh! He loved the toy and always kept him close, even sleeping with him. However, for a reason known only to "Igor", he got carried away one day and shredded Mr. Bill into microscopic pieces. I managed to salvage the voice box, but Mr. Bill has no body now to go with his voice. However, since Mr. Bill was a favorite and is reasonably priced, I have ordered Igor yet another one for his Xmas stocking.
This may be the best of all the Mutipet toys! Previously gave great reviews of others, but this one never stops! They bite it,  step on it, sit on it and hide it from each other. It always gives itself away tho with its "OOOOONNNOOOOOO!!!!" I keep 2 around here and have given several to friends. I think it's particularly popular with those of us who remember Mr Bill, but it sure translates to the dogs!While these are really durable for us I don't think real chewers will take long to dismantle this. My guys are over 80lbs bot don't chew or pull things apart.
To heck with the dogs or cats!  I got this for myself to play with!  I press the belly and out comes OHHH NOOO.  Comes in handy on occasions to bring levity to ponderous situations, like the tax bill, marital debates, forgot to get something at the grocery store, an unexpected expense, lost Amazon order; you know all those life situations where you just need to bring humor into the situation.  We are enjoying using it in our household.  The cat, though, did bat at it, tried to run with it thinking it was his.  OHHH NOOOO, I said.  Not a lasting quality item, but a fun time.
Not only does my dog love this toy, but so do I!!!I have a Westie and he loves to fetch Mr. Bill and then toss him around and shake him.  He gets really excited when he hears the "Ohhhh Noooooooo"  :-)Watching him makes me laugh and laugh - it is wonderful fun!Before I gave Mr. Bill to my pup, I had taken him to work.  Everyone that remembers Mr. Bill from Saturday Night Live laughed and loved him!  I ended up being asked to pick up FIVE more for friends!The one reviewer mentions the inside voice box - many of the dog toys I buy my dogs have a voice box - I just don't let them have those toys for long or without supervision.  When the toy gets ripped, I either sew it back up or take out the voice box.I don't think ANY toy is supposed to be given to a pet without some type of supervision - it just isn't safe.If you, or your friends remember Mr. Bill -- buy this and laugh!
My dog is an 80lb. mixed breed who just loves to pull the stuffing out of any and every toy. Mr. Bill far outlasted any thing with a squeaker in it because of his speaking box. When the dog started getting a little rough, the &#34;Ohhhhhh Nooooooo!!!&#34; would make him stop. Ahhhh, but it was not to be. Mr. Dog conquered Mr. Bill, but it took him over 2 months to slowly and painfully, bit by tiny bit, get the stuffing out -- first at the nose, then slowly, hour by hour, day by day, then entire head was emptied, and VIOLA...2 months later Mr. Bill no longer had a voice...alll bets were off, he is now nothing but the shell of the toy he used to be. But he's still good to play tug of war with. I already got Mr. Dog another one but I'm saving it for Christmas.
My 70 pound Lab loves this toy! She is a bit scared, but still interested enough to play with it. She is a chewer so I had to cut off the nose because she was trying to eat it, but other than that she has not chewed the toy up. She got one for Christmas and accidentally broke it when I threw it and she caught it and her tooth hit the box that makes the noise. I ordered 2 more for her. This is her favorite toy and it is durable.
Our two Schnauzers love this toy. As with most toys, if they last six months, I'm happy.  It's been about six months and Mr. Bill is going strong.  Our Schnauzers are pretty smart.  They know their toys names and will retrieved them when called.  This one is called &#34;Oh No!&#34;, what Mr Bill calls out.  As soon as we say OH NO! they are searching for Mr Bill.When we travel, Mr Bill is one of the toys that they look for in their travel bag.  It has been a lot of fun for the dogs and for us too.
Got this along with a few other toys a few weeks ago. This was clearly my dog's last choice. In fact, I didn't think he'd play with it at all. Eventually he started messing with it, so I was pretty thrilled. Of course, after a few days, he'd ripped some of the limbs open and stuffing was coming out. Overall, not one of his favorite toys, and doesn't seem very durable. The only squeaker in this thing is right in his stomach and it's hard to get to. I'm not even sure my dog even figured out it was in there, heck, I had trouble getting it. Get something else. Nothing special about sock monkey.
Too cute! Takes me back.... I HAD to purchase it as soon as I saw it. I bought it for my dog b/c I knew she'd rip it to shreds and Mr. Bill would cry out at the same time. What a riot!!! My dog is a lab and would gently carry Mr. Bill around in her jowls. When she'd bite down, Mr. Bill cried out - cracks me up. She played tug-o-war with it with my sister's dog, too. Within a short period of time, Mr. Bill was sadly torn to shreds, but it was fun while he lasted!
Mr. little 8 month old female puppy loves this toy best of all.  It's unique "oh noooo" sound is activated by pushing a spot on the tummy area and whenever she hears that she comes running ready to play.  A couple of times lately she has accidentally made its "voice" go off too which she seemed to like also.  It's good to throw holding by one arm so it does "cartwheels".  I have two dogs actually, both under 10 pounds, and sometimes the two of them both grab and arm and play tug of war after I throw it which is fun too.  It's holding up very well but nonetheless I'm getting another because she likes it so much and I don't want to be left empty-handed if the other one quits working or if it just gets too dirty.  Me and my two dogs give it a definite thumbs up.
I bought this toy because we have a running joke in my house basically saying that one of my three Pekingese loves to make toys with squeaks in them "scream".  He only plays with a toy that has a squeak in it until it doesn't squeak anymore, then moves onto the next.  I bought Mr. Bill for him, because I thought that he would love the "Oh NO!" sound and sure enough... instant hit.  He carried Mr. Bill all over the house with him and we always knew where he was because we could hear the "Oh NO!" sounds from all over the house.  Sadly, Mr. Bill has been retired, because he was taken out into the yard in the rain and got muddy and as I can't wash him with his battery pack in, I threw him away until I can buy another one.  Anyway, great toy!  Can't wait to get him back into our house!
Little did I know when I boughtMr. Bill, that when chewed, he cries out "Oh nooooooo!" just like his SNL tv namesake!  Lady, my black lab absolutely loves this toy. When we gave her Mr. Bill two months ago, she forgot about her other toys for almost a month.  She has started playing with her other toys again, but this is still her favorite.The only drawback is, because of the "Mr. Bill" sound-maker, it can only be surface-washed.  This is Lady's only toy that can't be tossed in the washer and dryer, but it's worth it to see my Lady with this toy.  I'm going to buy a few more, just to have on hand, in case Mr. Bill gets too dirty to surface wash.  I only wish they had a Mr. Hand dog toy to go with this.  ;-)
This particular Lambchop Toy is very well made, had a good loud squeaker in it, but most importantly is soft and comforting to my &#34;big baby&#34;, a 75 pound Labrador Retriever!! He had a smaller sized one about two years ago, and he loved it to death by sleeping on it, carrying it in his mouth, regular tooth pulling play time, and we finally had to retire the scraps of what was left (when he was not looking, of course....).  He looked for Lambchop for awhile, but he gave up. I was so discouraged that I couldn't find one ANYWHERE.  THEN, I was so pleased to see a new and BIGGER one on Amazon!!  The Price was outstanding, and my Labrador and his Lambchop are back to being cuddle buddies again.  This is a great dog toy.  I highly recommend it.
This toy is just great! I originally bought one from Target (on sale for about $2.00) and my dog just feel in love w/ this him. He was playing with him, sleeping with him and he has to have Mr. Bill next to him at all times for next few days... Then somehow, we lost him.... so I had to buy him another Mr. Bill! He still loves to play with him and I think the sound he makes is just great! :) Totally recommend this product to any dog owners.. My dog is a 15 lb maltipoo btw
My little 3 pound maltese seems to like Mr Bill even tho, Mr Bill is almost bigger than him.  I only received Mr Bill today but it did not take my little pooch but a couple of minutes to bite Mr Bill's nose off.  Actually, I am glad he did it immediately and I noticed it immediately because he could have choked on it.  Seriously.  We pet owners love our animals and many of us love them like children and have little dogs that have to be watched carefully for hazardous items.  I strongly suggest when receiving Mr Bill, you go ahead and snip his nose off.  The nose on mine was on with one thread.  I am glad I ordered him as my dog likes it and funny to see him dragging around an item almost bigger than him.  Just keep in mine Mr Bill's nose.
Seriously.  She was my Maltese puppy's first stuffed plush toy and is his favorite.  I got Lambchop because I thought she might remind him of his litter mates and he has loved her from the very beginning.  If you see him without Lambchop in sight, all you have to do is ask him where Lambchop is and he will go running to find and bring her back.Lambchop is very well made.  She has to be to withstand the daily tumbles she has to endure with the puppy.  Not one seam has come loose, nothing except she's beginning to look pretty grungy and I'm not so sure about touching her any more without washing my hands afterward.  I've ordered some stuffed animal cleaner and sure hopes it works.And, uh, this is kinda sensitive and I'm not sure the pup would want me to share, but I think it's time to call the vet.
Not the &#34;Ohhhhhh noooooooo!&#34; again! This toy gets to be very annoying because that's all it says but it's fun to see the look on the dog's face when Mr. Bill says it. This toy is not for destructive breeds or if the dog doesn't use the soft mouth. The box inside breaks if dog chews on it alone. It has stuffing in it but if you want and know how to, you just sew it back up. It's a fun toy but easy to break. This was the 3rd toy I've bought for the dog. She likes the &#34;Ohhhh noooo!!!&#34;
So, Mr. Bill is not the sturdiest of dog toys, but he's hilarious. It's a great toy to give the dog when we have company over, because his 'Oh Nooooooooooo' squeaker makes everyone laugh. Our pitbull/rotweiller beheaded Mr. Bill in a few days, but the squeaker has survived, and our dog is terrified of it. If he's doing something naughty, we pull out Mr. Bill's squeaker, and the &#34;Oh Noooooooo!&#34; stops him in his tracks. Worth the money, for sheer entertainment value.
This is a durable and soft plush doggie toy - The dogs have a small basket full of toys, but Lambchop is one of their fav's to pick out of the box and tussle around.Has a couple squeaker's - so if that drives you crazy you may want to consider something different.Lambchop has also been machine washed and dried in the dryer (on low temp) several times and survived just fine.I have even purchased them a replacement for when the old one does bite the dust, they will have another -
We have a chewer in the family so I knew this wouldn't last long. Fortunately, our dog was content for a while just playing catch with it and experimenting with what would set the sound sensor off. Eventually, she nabbed it and went into a chewing session and went straight for the battery compartment. However, we did know this isn't a chew toy. The battery lasted the four weeks until he was destroyed. We all had fun going around the house listening to Mr. Bill and his &#34;oh no&#34; cries. If they made a durable version of this I'd buy in a second.
I recently got a puppy who is chewing on everything, except most of the puppy toys.  This is one of the exceptions.  He loves it.  His two favorite things are his Mr. Bill doll and his bully stick.  Both of them are holding up well.  If I activate the &#34;Oh, noooooo&#34; sound, he pounces on it and jumps around.  If he activates it in his mouth, he does a demonstration of the shaken baby syndrome and runs around the house.  I am amazed at the abuse this toy has taken.  If he ever destroys it, I will be getting him another.  As to the reviewer who bought it for his brother, not realizing it was a dog toy, I am sure any fan of Mr. Bill (and maybe even those who have never heard of Mr. Bill) would love to have this doll.
The frog and duck toys held up so well that I decided to get the teddy bear (it is SO cute). Poor Mr. Bear doesn't last a day. My dog is 12 pounds and it is so incredibly easy to chew the limbs off these guys. My dog gnawed off the leg of one of the bears so we bought him a new one (what were we thinking?) He gnawed off another leg. We duct taped it back on and he gnawed through the duct tape. Cute toy for small pups if they aren't big chewers but my dog is just determined to eat this thing.
My two young Siberian Huskies play with this.  My girl claims it as hers and often sleeps with it.  It fits her mouth about right, as she is on the small side for Huskies.  This is her 2nd teddy bear.  The 1st lasted about 1 year being squabbled over, pulled on, licked on, and gnawed.  It finally died when she figured out how to open the velcro opening in the back and chewed up the squeaker, the velcro, and other parts of the bear.
My 2 yr old standard schnauzer will chew through anything.  I've been searching for a bully stick that will last more than 20 minutes with her, and still haven't found one.  For some reason though, she plays with this toy differently.  Handles it gingerly and is more interested in playing catch with herself than tugging and tearing.  That said, this is the first non-animal-part toy that has lasted more than 5 minutes.  It has become her favorite over the past 24 hours, which is 24 times longer than I thought it would last.Update: one eye is missing from the bear, but all the seams appear to be intact and she's still very engaged.  Very impressed with the item, although I'm sure it would be torn to shreds if it was her choosing.
My dog is very spoiled ans has access to 20++ &#34;babies&#34;...this Kong Teddy Bear is always on his bed or near on the floor. I put it back in his bin and less that 24 hours later there is the Teddy Bear! Very soft, strong build quality (he has used it for over 6 months; 70lb German Sheppard/Doberman and &#34;plays&#34; with his &#34;babies&#34;). I highly recommend this product as a cost-effective toy that, for my dog at least, is a must-have on a daily basis. As I type he is laying with it on his bed!
I'm glad this toy has no stuffing in it, but for a few dollars more, the Kong Cozie is stuffed firmly and has a squeaker in the middle that lasts and lasts. My puppy has two varieties of the unstuffed Kong animals, one being this frog. They were correct to give you a free extra sqeaker. The toy, without stuffing, is very thin and flimsy, and the squeakers don't last. So far, the toy has not ripped, though, so I think the quality is decent for 5 bucks! But my 8 and 9 dollar Kong Cozies last as well and there is no need for extra squeakers.
Having a 3 year old beagle that has destroyed toys in 3 minutes or less after receiving them, I'm always on the lookout for one she will like, and that will last longer than a bullrider does.This toy is one of my beagle's favorites! She fell in love with this critter!  She loves the squeaky in its head, and will carry it around in her mouth.  We don't let her have it when she's home alone, since I don't want her to get bored and chew her way through to the squeaker, but otherwise, it's held up wonderfully. We also don't let her play 'pull' with it. It comes with a replacement squeaker, which is nice.It's the perfect size for our beagle, and almost the perfect toy. If the size we received is 'medium', I wouldn't order anything smaller for any dog except a Chihuahua.  I hope to find some more!
I received the bears (bought 2 of them) yesterday and I gave my 9 month old puppy Macie(Pug & JRT Mix) one of the bears. She had the pocket pulled out thru the head where the squeeky is within 30 min or so. She continued to play with the bear but also the pocket and the squeeky is just about destroyed....lol...she has a tendency to destroy every squeeky in a toy, so this doesnt surprise me. A little bit of stuffing came out - not sure what part of the bears body - but other then that she is still playing with the bear. Let's see how long the body will last before she shredds it to pieces. I'm still looking for a toy that she cannot destroy and I haven't found it yet. I think toymakers need to give me the toys to test and then if they survive they can be stamped 'Macie approved'
Our Apollo can't live without his Teddy! I've never had a dog so attached to his toy. He mangles it,runs with it and sleeps with it. Absolutely in love with it. It has held up better than any of his other toys...I just wish Amazon would bring back the large version of this toy. I bought 2 mediums in case his beloved large fails. This dog toy is the best and has taken 2 years of 95 lb. black Lab punishment...now that is a true test!!
I purchased this item mid January 2012. Its mid July now 2012 & the teddy has lasted so far with no issues. This is my dogs absolute favorite toy & she plays with it daily. It can be her chew buddy for hours on end & the squeaky noise just thrills her to no end. She has several other toys but this one is her first love. I was about to purchase another one right now as backup for when this one goes out, when I realized that I had not reviewed this & given it the credit it deserves. 5 STARS all day long.
My miniature pinscher Bella has this little bear and a little duck.  Both of them she's had since she was a baby, 9 months ago and both of them are still in great condition.  They last a long time!  She has torn up many toys in the past but these have held up with no problem at all!  They are definitely two of her favorite toys!  They are very small though, don't buy them if you have a larger dog at all, I think they are just best for toy breed dogs, Bella is 6 pounds.
My little dog likes these toys and I like the fact they have no stuffing.  They provide an extra squeaker but she will quickly kill both the squeakers and then just drag the little bear around with her.  This is her second one of this same toy because she liked the first one so well that it eventually just started to fall apart.  It did last for quite a while though as she normally can destroy a toy in a day.  She just kept looking for the stuff on this one which was funny because there is none.
I have two dogs, one big and one small...they both love this toy.  Best of all, it's extremely durable.  Normally with squeaky toys I have to monitor their play with them because if I don't then I come back in the room three minutes later and they have it all torn apart, stuffing all over the room and have proudly destroyed the squeaker.  This one we've had for a couple weeks now, it's in their toy basket that they always have access to, they play with it pretty much daily and they've yet to destroy it.  Fantastic deal on this.
I have a 25 pound mini goldendoodle.  I thought no way does she tear through this &#34;indestructible&#34; teddy bear.  Lasted all of 5 minutes and she had both ears off and the legs torn off... What a joke.  KONG should not be allowed to sell such garbage.  I read the reviews and thought &#34;well they must have a pitbull or a larger dog&#34;... NOPE, my 25 pound doodle ripped it in minutes.  Stay away from this one and go with the fire house toys.
I have a Jack Russell Terrier that is a chew-maniac. I bought this bear hoping it would last a bit longer than most, based on good things I have heard about the Kong brand. It's been about a month and a half now, and he has ripped out the pouch for the replaceable squeaker (the squeaker itself was the 1st thing to go- in the first week), but the squeaker in the bear's head is still there. Aside from that, the rest of the bear is fully intact. My pup treats it with care, not biting as hard as usual when playing tug of war. He also plays fetch with it, but surprisingly does not chew it. I have seen him licking it and carrying it around though. When I get home from work, he often greets me at the door with a toy already in his mouth, and this bear is definitely one of his favorites.
This stuffed frog is for &#34;small&#34; dogs, and I mean small. It is very small, and my dog is 12 lbs, and she loves it. She loves tiny toys. I estimate this toy is best for mini-pets like Chihuahua or small (under 10 lbs). I didn't actually see this one from Amazon because I ordered it for my best friend's new puppy who live in CA. I saw this at Petsmart and loved it. It is very cute, and from memory, it is about 3+ inches tall. The fur is soft, and I believe it also has a squeak in it.
My American Eskimo absolutely loves this toy. The moment I gave it to him, he started chewing on it and shaking it around. It seemed sturdy, but I immediately started seeing random tufts of fur coming off of the toy. It's not a lot but I'll see a few strands here and there on the floor as a result of him chewing it up. It's only been a week and I'm already seeing signs of wear and tear on the toy. My dog loves everything about the toy, but I just wish it were more durable. At this rate I am not sure if it will last more than a month or so.Another comment is in regards to the squeaker. It comes with a replacement squeaker but I am not sure how to even get the one inside the bear out. In the toy I received, the squeaker is in the head of the bear and sewn shut.
Oh she adores all her pets but the beaver even it is so small the adores and tries to hide this one and bury it in her bed so no one sees it to take it away from her.  Oh this is so cute being so small (The dukies are cute too - but ); she loves the beaver even more (maybe because of the tail?  Thanks so much KONG for this one.  Again NOT FOR A LARGE DOG  (TOO SMALL)  My dog only 4lbs 5oz.
Okaye, this toy arrived in a little padded envelope.  It was tiny.  It does not look like the photo.  It is about the size of a mouse, only it's empty except for the squeaker.  I put both squeakers in to make it fill out and squeak more easily.... it's tiny!  It is good for a small dog puppy, not a larger breed puppy, unless it wants to play with something the size of a mouse.  My dog gets very excited about toys but this was quickly abandonned after a little over 5 minutes.  She's 13 lbs.  I'm not crazy about the velcro and how  you can take the squeakers out, that's something I believe some dogs can easily figure out.
As soon as I opened the Amazon box, Harri was right there, jumping up and grabbing the toy in her mouth and tearing off like a dog on fire. She seems to like the visual texture the dye-job provides, along with the actual texture of the fur.  I got her the large dog toy, wich seems to be just the right size for her. She's a 65 lb. Coonhound, which is not what I would consider to be a large dog, for those of you wondering about which size to get. So far, it seems to be a sturdy toy, but it has yet to be tested by a good game of tug-of-war between Harri and her sister, Sally.  It has held up very well to a lot of other plush toys, and I've found that I've had good luck with Dr. Noys in the past, so I'm more likely to take a chance on Dr. Noys compared to other plush toys.
Dog liked this one. Enough to play with it lovingly until it was just a shred of brown cloth and fur. He chewed through the body right away to get at the squeaker, but continued chewing long after the squeaker was removed. Did not contain any stuffing for me to remove, and surprisingly the tail stayed on for the whole ride, even after being used frequently as a tug toy.It lasted about 1 month in good condition (not counting the whole where the squeaker was removed from) and lasted in ok condition for another 4 months. I still have it and occasionally give it since dog seems to like killing it just as much as day one.It is very small. fits nicely in the palm of my hand. Dog is 10 lbs, and it was perfect for him, but playing chase the beaver was sometimes a nail biting affair. Dog's biting, my nails.
As a big fan of the Dr. Noys toy line, I was quite disappointed when this bear arrived. After searching in the bottom of the box for it, I found it drowning in the peanuts (just kidding). This size is seriously more appropriate for something like a Yorkie or chihuahua. It's too small for our 20lb. mix, and definitely not ten inches tall as the description stated. Still, our dog has tossed it around, and I've found Dr. Noy's toys to be quite durable.
My shih tzu puppy loves this tiny kong toy.  He's able to squeak it easily and gets great joy out of that.  Larger squeaker toys are difficult for him to squeak.  This is perfect for small puppies who are teething and still have their baby teeth.  I also have the tiny frog like this one.  If your small dog or puppy has a hard time making his or her toys squeak they will love this.  It also comes with a replacement squeaker and you can remove the squeaker easily through the velcro opening to wash the toy. The velcro seals tightly.I see some other reviewers dogs have destroyed this toy, it is tiny so keep that in mind before ordering.  It definitely is a small dog toy (slightly smaller than the length of your hand when you include the flat tail).
This product isn't quite as high quality as it looks in the picture above, and I'd highly recommend you take a close look at its dimensions before purchasing it (if this is a 'medium,' I can't imagine how tiny the 'small' must be).  I'd also only recommend this item for supervised play (not, as I'd hoped, as a snuggly toy to leave in my puppy's crate overnight).  The body of the toy is only the length of my index finger, and I'm concerned that any larger breed puppy will rip this thing to shreds in minutes if you let him.  Oh well.
I got this for my 10 week old miniature dachshund puppy. She loved it, and unlike a lot of toys, she was able to make it squeak very easily. The body of the toy (minus tail) is about the size of a small mouse (real), so you wouldn't want to get this for a big dog. It came with an extra squeaky, which I loved. Unfortunately, our larger, chewing machine dog got a hold of it and tore it, so the old squeaky is broken and the new one won't stay in.  I might have to order another one, it was such a good toy for the puppy!
This product really works well. I have a 7 year old pup who was starting to show signs of weak hips and stiffness. I could see that her joints were a bit stiff because it took her a while to sit or lay down.  However, after a few weeks on this product, she's sitting much more quickly and she doesn't struggle with sitting or laying down.The downside to this product is that she doesn't like it!!  Its a chalky pill that she spits out every time I give it to her.  I have to coax her with a treat but its starting to get a bit tedious to bribe her every day.  Good thing I bought the small bottle!  Once its done (10 more to go!), I'm switching to something more palatable.
...between this product and Advantix, depending upon which product is priced less expensive at the time. That's because both work well at fighting fleas for approximately 3 1/2 weeks. I don't know whether it's because I have a dog and four cats, but we have to reapply flea meds every month, so claims that this product breaks the cycle completely either isn't accurate, or . . . well, I can't fathom why it wouldn't break the cycle completely. We apply the product on all cats and our dog simultaneously, so you'd think that the fleas would die off permanently. Still, it does seem to kill the adults very quickly, as any scratching that took place prior to application immediately stopped after application.
This year I decided to go cheap and purchase a less expensive brand of flea control... well I certainly paid for it with a nice infestation of fleas, even on my inside cat! I went back to this more expensive (but certainly more reliable) brand and the fleas have completely gone. I noticed with the cheaper brands they have a lot of liquid and it takes forever for the big greasy spot on the back of the cat's neck to try. How unsightly! But with this I couldn't even tell if I was putting any on them, it was so discreet. I will definitely be sticking with this from now on.
As strictly related to shipping, it arrived several days late, which causes me concern with a product that should be kept in a controlled environment. Amazon shipping is usually spot-on, but this was not one of those times. Frustrating to wait for something that we needed for our pets. So I suggest ordering ahead of your actual need.We have 2 indoor cats that had what I would call a minor flea problem. The initial dose seemed to do the job. And unlike some treatments I've used it was well tolerated. No irritation to the skin, etc.We had a recurrence of fleas just over a month later and had to re-apply the product. I know fleas are hard to get rid of completely so I'm not totally surprised. I was hoping that the first dose would end the problem, seeing as the fleas weren't that bad.I shopped around and Amazon had the best price. So really the only thing bugging me was the mishandling of the shipping.
If you're cat is an indoor cat, yes this product will work well for you. But if your cats go outside like mine, FORGET IT! Yes Advantage kills fleas that are on your pet immediately. But it does not keep them flea free for 30 days, like they advertise. I've tried Advantage on my cats a few times. The fleas that were on my cats did die within 12 hours. But within ONE WEEK they were biting and scratching again like before. I'm picking fleas off of them after only a week and a half. If the product wasn't so expensive, it might be worth the money. But don't waste your money, because it only works well for a few days. Frontline works a lot better.
Many products are not safe... like Hartz, and made my cat sick.  Advantage works great on all my cats, and they are  indoors at night and out playing most of the day. I alternate cats when I use Advantage, and apply it only every 3 weeks to ONE cat at a time in the winter.... still no fleas! In the summer I use it every 4 weeks as suggested. My daughter has 8 cats and a dog, and uses only Advantage for flea control.  It works better than anything else out there.  It's so nice not to have flea bites all around my ankles, or fleas in my home !!
I don't care what the box says-Advantage does NOT last a month.  In two weeks the fleas will return.  I found that flea protection is best when you use HALF DOSE (0.4 ml per cat-this contains 0.8 ml per bottle), applied twice a month.  For me this has worked perfectly. Now if you have indoor cats, you most likely will not need to treat your cat all the time. Use a FLEA COMB a few times a week to monitor the presence of fleas. If you see one single flea, get them all treated, but use HALF DOSE. That may all your indoor cat needs.Once in a blue moon my indoor cats need to be treated, and this works well.Also please vacuum your house. The flea eggs and fleas cannot and will not survive in vacuum cleaner bags, and is the best way to deflea your house, and include your furniture :-)
Advantage is the first flea control for my 3 cats that seems to be effective.  We have tried lots of products and this is the bomb.  No more fleas on the cats, no more fleas on my ankles, no more fleas period.  You'll need one dose per cat per month.  I got the six pack and treat all 3 for 2 months at a time.  This stuff is alot more expensive at the pet store.  Found it on Amazon and bought it from a place that resells overstock.  The box was wrinkled, but the contents were in perfect shape.  Paid an excellent price, I think around 34.00 for 6 doses of the up to 9 pound cat mixture, and the shipping was free!  Quit wasting your time with other stuff and simply give it a try.
Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially, but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first, but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks, but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus.
I put this on my cat 4 times over a 4 month period. (He is a healthy 3 year old) Each time, he reacted more negatively than the time before. Last dose, he acted as if it was stinging him, and he was aggressive and in a bad mood for 2 days. I looked up information regarding counterfeit flea meds and although the vials do have the right wording--the epa # on the vials is one of two epa #'s that have been counterfeited. I am not taking anymore chances with the last two vials. I am throwing it out. Guess I will have to buy from a more reputable source in order to feel safe about this.
I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer, so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution, but that is extremely expensive, especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks, just fleas. Even so, I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far, so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline.
I saw fleas after having been using an oral medication for my dogs--it seemed to have STOPPED working..threw the kids in the tub...bathed them - then RAN to PetsMart and bought the Advantage....in less than 24 hours my dogs STOPPED scratching and slept the night.  I have ordered their next doses from Amazon...but at the first sign of the fleas I wanted IMMEDIATE action..LOLand per another reviewer I did in fact notice a whiff of "altered" breath on one of my (small) dogs---but it was't awful--but definitely "changed"
After two applications I saw no improvement on my puppy. Then I found out online that it is ineffective if it's applied within 48 hours before and after the bathing. Shouldn't this information be on the box if it's so important? I called the manufacturer and was "serviced" by very argumentative representative. I don't think the product is worth the money at all. A friend of mine who used it also see no effect on her dog. You are better off buying from Hartz. At least their products are cheap and customer service is superb.
I decided to buy Bayer Advantage because Frontline Plus was not killing fleas for a whole month, after 2 weeks I noticed fleas on my animals. So when the month was up, I bought Bayer Advantage it works great, for a whole month, killing all fleas, I did have to reapply 2 weeks later because it said so on the box in case of severe infestations to do so. I did so because my animals are allergic to flea bites. I will buy this again. Its a great value here on amazon. Much better than Frontline.
I previously used Advantage to take care of my cat's flea problem, and it worked immediately - but my cat absolutely hated the smell which lingered on her body.  She would howl and run off when she saw me approaching with the Advantage vial, and I hate being the villain once a month. So now I've switched to Program.  It's kind of a pain mashing the tablet and mixing it up into wet catfood.  Also, it takes a couple of days to take effect.  But - it does work well, and my cat is very happy. I will definitely buy Program tabs again.
There's a good article comparing the flea products: [...]The condition of the surrounding and pets all need to be considered before choosing the right product that suits your needs. I have a cat and dog. My dog is a flea magnet and the only product that works for him is Revolution and I love the fact that it's a heart worm prevention med also. However I put the cat on Program since she is an indoor cat and I feel more comfortable using this on her because my dog licks my cat but not vice versa. I use the Greenie pill pockets to wrap the tablet and has no problem at all enticing her to eat it. So far this combination works perfect for me. Every animal is different. It takes a little trial and error to find the best product for that animal specifically.
I used Advantage for years on our outdoor cats and always dreaded the monthly trial of applying it.  It was messy, smelled, and neither the cats nor I enjoyed it.  I started using Program a couple of months ago and couldn't be happier.  There's a lot of liquid in the monthly dose, but I mix it up with some wet food and the cats don't even know it's there.  They gobble it up and DONE.  One cat is 8 lbs and the other about double that, and neither has experienced any negative side effects.  Since Program targets flea eggs, we combine it with the Capstar tablets to address the adult fleas, as well.  It's made a huge difference, and I'm gratified to see the cats relax in comfort rather than constantly scratching and biting.
I purchased this for my cats to try after a recent flea incident in the house.  I tried to mix the suspension with their food (I tried dry food and wet treats)... they sniffed it and walked away.  I then followed the instructions and had to hold the cat and squirt the suspension into their mouth.  It was messy, they hated it.. and I felt horrible trying to get them to take all of it.  I'm sticking with Frontline Plus...much easier for my cats.
Program is the safest long lasting flea treatment for pets-- I used to work in a veterinary hospital and I have seen many cats have serious reactions to  Advantage and Frontline, which are topical pesticides.Read the inserts for Advantage and Frontline, it says that they are NOT safe for sick animals, young kittens, etc, etc. My cat is allergic to both Frontline and Advantage. Frontline gave him a lump in his neck and Advantage gave him a bald spot where I applied it, and he kept trying to lick the spot.Program is super safe-- you can put it in a dish and mix it with tuna and your cat will eat it right up. You can use it with Capstar (also super safe, but not long lasting) to kill live fleas if your cat picks one up. This is the best monthly flea control to keep your cat safe and healthy! I have used it for almost a decade and I will not use any other product on my cat.
I first discovered these on Facebook.  The lady who manufactures them has a really funny FB page that I recommend you check out.  These bags are great.  I never go on walks with the dogs without a couple in my pocket (and often an extra one or two to share with those dog parents who just maybe didn't think about the fact that they should pick up their dog's business).They come in different sizes and a clean one can even double as a portable water bowl for your furry friend.I like that they are biodegradable so I am not adding to the landfill problem.You can use them to put your cat's litter box deposits in as well.
Mutt Mitts are the best waste bags I've found. They are much sturdier (you won't stick your hand through) and the double layer at the bottom of the mitt means even more strength and protection from unpleasant poop pick up. These are pretty good sized, so it's easy to tie and fabulous for extra large breeds down to small breeds.The packaging is well designed too. The two holes at top allow you to hang the bags near the door or out of site behind a door or panel. Two thumbtacks easily hold up the package and allow you to tear off bags as you need them. A++ product. If you have dogs, you really should try these baggies!
I hated these bags!  Yeah I know, I stand alone in this.  But I do hate them!  Wen I clean up dog poop, I also clean up any remnants of poop on the grass, sometimes pulling bits of grass out on purpose so as to leave nothing behind (as best as I can).  These bags make that impossible.  There is no give in these bags for detailed work such as described.  These bags are like doing surgery with hockey goalie gloves on.  So I am back to standard bags which work great (I prefer Bags on Board - come off roll clean, never fail/tear/etc., can pick up more than one pile (we've smaller dogs), etc....
We have an 85-pound dog and use 1,000 bags per year (3 per day). There is no denying how good these are, as described by other reviewers. It's the most comfortable way to handle an unpleasant task.What bothers me though is the extra plastic and expense involved with these. Taking into account environmental and economic factors, I prefer to use the smaller and thinner120 Earth Rated Dog Waste Bags, Lavender Scented, 8 Rolls, 120-Count.So what we do is keep both items on hand in a fanny pack. For the biggest or messiest "jobs", we use Mutt Mitts. For typical "duty", the above linked product is very good. That way everyone wins!
This quality spray did exactly as advertised. I have a cat, who likes to go outside his litter box, and an active toddler who loves to drop food and color on our light-colored carpet.  I used this Bissell Pet Stain and Odor spray as directed, generously spraying a stained area, blotting and covering with a wet rag, and leaving it alone for several hours.  I am pleased to say that even some long-time stains that I grown to live with are starting to fade considerably or disappear entirely.As another reviewer pointed out, this product does not work on ink. My toddler colored on a portion of our den carpet with an ink pen, and this spray was not very effective on that area. However, as promised, it did eliminate virtually all of my cat stains throughout the house. I have no complaints and would easily recommend this to others.
If you have pets then you should have the BISSELL PET STAIN & ODOR PRE-TREATER SPRAY on hand for those occasional accidents. Even though my Shiba just turned 2-years old and she's potty trained, she'll still has accidents. The other day she ate something and threw up a little and so I used the BISSELL PET PRE-TREATER to spray the area, after wiping up the mess.I let it soak for a few minutes then used theBISSELL Spotbot Pet Handsfree Spot and Stain Cleaner with Deep Reach Technology, 33N8Ato power clean the area and it works well together, though the SPOTBOT machine works fine on its own.I think the spray is the same type of solution that you use in the SPOTBOT, so I think this can be used even if you don't own the machine itself.Definitely keep a bottle on hand just in case.
I use it to pre-treat my carpet in heavy stained spots, but it's also VERY handy for when my puppy has accidents here and there. Instead of cleaning my carpet all over again (no way, it takes too much time), I just spray this and clean it off. I think this works better than the concentrated 2X formula, not to mention its scent is even better. If you own a puppy or a pet that isn't fully housebroken yet, buy it. You'll be glad you have something that cleans your carpet easily and fast without the use of a cleaner.
I've used Nature's Miracle for years on pet stains, and found it to be the best at removing stubborn smells, but I'm always willing to try something new.I tried this Bissell Pre-Treat on some old upholstered chairs my husband purchased at a garage sale for $5. He was going to use them out in his shop so he didn't mind a few stains, but I really minded the old-dog-urine smell!After using the pre-treat as recommended, I proceeded to clean the chairs using my Bissell Spot Bot and was pleasantly surprised with the results. The chairs looked nearly new, only two small stains remained on the light colored material. Unfortunately, the smell was more stubborn, and required a re-wash and application of Nature's Miracle to finally make it disappear for good.
I typically pre-treat most stains prior to carpet cleaning.  This is a ok pre-treat but I likeBISSELL Tough Stain Pre-treat for Carpet & Upholstery, 22 ozbetter.  I have beige carpet and this cleaner seems to occasionally leave a residue that leaves my carpet with a pink tinge.  I've been able to remove the substance by waiting until the spot dries and going over the spot with the carpet cleaner a second time.  For lighter carpets, I would recommend theBISSELL Tough Stain Pre-treat for Carpet & Upholstery, 22 oz.
My German Sheperd LOVES this!!He is crazy about playing ball and the Chuck it! makes me happy to play. No more slobbery balls to throw.Your dog drops the ball at your feet (hopefully) and all you need to do is slap the Chuck It on the ball and toss again!Care must be taken if using in a fenced enclosure--the ball can travel quite a distance when &#34;chucked&#34;. I have gone into neighbors yards several times to retrieve an overthrown ball.This is a great toy for man and beast!!The rubber balls that are used with the Chuck It are sturdy and have stood up to the chomping of my dog's jaws--which have reduced other balls to rubble.The white ball actually does glow in the dark if you have a dog who is in to night time play.
I wish I would have bought this a year ago. I used to walk past this in the store and think, "Wow I should try that!" But the 20.00 price tag always turned me away. I already had toys to play fetch with and my dog loved the frisbee so I wasn't sure if he would take to the ball the same way. I saw this on amazon and had to buy it. 10.00 was a steal. Now that I have tried it I would spend the 20.00 that the big stores ask for this. I am very happy with my purchase and it shipped very fast!
A BALL THROWING ARM EXTENSION! It does best overhand, my uncle mike who was in Vietnam and doesn't have much use of his arms after the agent orange issues he has, can use this thing like no problem, hes the reason i got it. I figured if my uncle could chuck-it 50 yards i could do a little more, honestly i only get it about 50-60 myself,I bought a set a balls definitely buy the ones from chuckit, normal balls work fine but when they get slimey the release early, plus my lab skins and splits tennis balls down the seem in about 3 mins... she has yet to destroy a chuckit ball, but i also dont give her much of a chance to do so.Great for dogs that like to run, as long as they dont run off! lolits been over a year now and the original set of balls are still good, the chuckit rides in the trunk just fine... i love it
My dog's all-time favorite pastime is her small ChuckIt! ball.  She always knows exactly where it is and makes plenty of opportunities for me to toss it for her.  After a while though, it gets slippery, so when I saw this Launcher I wasn't sure it would work for me but decided to give it a try.  Well, it does work!  It takes a small effort to get it to snap onto the ball, and then toss the ball with a flick of your wrist and the ball will fly much further than tossing it with your hand.  Terrific little gadget for making playtime fun for you and your dog.  Be sure to get the appropriate size for your dog's mouth.  This comes in several sizes.  Make sure the ball is not small enough for the dog to accidentally get it lodged in the throat, or so large that the dog strains the jaws trying to hold on to it.
We've got a golden retriever and a pug russel mix and both of them are crazy for playing fetch. Unfortunately I have a pretty pathetic pitch. I have to give it everything I've got to get any distance so after just a few throws my shoulder hurts, my hands are slimy and the dogs are still rearing to go. Which is why I LOVE THIS TOY!! I can send it so much farther without having to put in so much effort. My favorite part is having clean hands and tired dogs! The product comes with one "Chuckit" ball but also works with standard tennis balls (which I recommend). The Chuckit balls aren't very durable and it seemed like the dogs were having a harder time seeing the darker colors in the grass and water.
The Chuckit Launcher is a necessity if you have a dog that enjoys the game of fetch.  I have always known about this product but considered it for the lazy man.  My yellow lab has enough energy to make a game of fetch feel like pitching nine innings in the big leagues.  It would get to the point where I would have to ice my shoulder.  I eventually invested in one of these and now use it regularly.  Once you get the hang of the throwing motion you can launch the ball incredible distances with very little effort.It came with a fuzzy tennis ball which I eventually replaced with a Chuck glow ball.  This rubber ball is much better then any tennis ball and glows in the dark so I can use it at night.I gave this 5 stars because it has now become an essential tool to deal with my dogs energy.  Keeping her exercised makes life a lot easier in the house.
I've owned a Chuckit! for over three years, and I can't imagine owning a dog without owning one.  They are durable, inexpensive, and a great aid to throwing balls, especially for we women who don't have the upper arm strength of you men.  They also allow me to pick up the ball (any standard tennis ball will fit, though it comes with a two toned ball) and throw it again without bending over, and you need not touch a slobbery, muddy, grass covered wet ball. I can throw a ball at least 3-4 times farther with the Chuckit! than without one.  They are very common among local dog owners, and the dogs love them.  Treat yourself and your four legged loyal friend to this great toy.  I only wish I had invented it!
We already had a green chuck it about the same size. We got a second one so we could each have one in our car. Our dog gets so excited when she sees the chuckit that she's a excited mess all the way to the park. So now we keep a chuckit in each of our cars, out of sight, so that we can always be prepared to play ball with our dog. The chuckit pro is nice. The grip is a nice touch and this one flings the ball further than the regular chuckits with not much effort. Maybe it's weighted differently? Anyway- we fight over who gets to keep the chuckit pro in their car.
There's something about the Chuckit that drives my dog nuts.  She'll bark at anyone holding it who doesn't throw the ball immediately.  Plus, if you get the end of an empty Chuckit near her mouth, it's a chew toy.  So, it's a Chuckit and a Chewit.  This thing can keep her entertained for hours.The Jr (now called 18M) is perfect for active small dogs or medium dogs, and when you lose the ball that came with it (and you will when another dog runs off with the ball), the Jr will fit regular tennis balls.
I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one, but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces, but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But, it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use, she loves the game.
I've had one of the original chuckit 26-inch launchers for a long time and love it.  The only real complaint I had with it was that the handle wasn't very ergonomic and sometime slipped out of my hand on a strong throw.  When I saw this 25M, it looked like it could be really nice.  It's OK .. the handle is nice and works about as well as the old one.  The issue is that the ball cup is too loose.  Perhaps it's a decent enough fit for the fuzzy tennis-ball type balls but the rubber chuckit balls like the whistler and the glow-in-the-dark are too loose.  I have to bend the cup closed a bit after every few throws or the ball will slip out at the wrong point in the throw.  Admittedly, I give the thing a good heave .. typically throw the ball a good 160-200 feet depending on the wind .. but I never had that problem with the old chuckit.
My husband and I love seeing who can launch the ball the farthest for our springer spaniel. I can barely get the ball from the pitching mound to home plate, so this thing saves my arm from having to repeatedly throw the ball short distances for the energetic dog.Some people said that they have trouble with how the ball releases from the launcher. I never had this problem--it always released at just the right time for a perfect distance. My husband, however, has trouble with it releasing to LATE (some people had problems with it releasing too early). I guess it varies from person to person!
Are you sick and tired of picking up slobbery, wet, drool dripping tennis balls? Then the answer to your problems is in the Chuck It. I can spend hours at the part with this toy playing with me dog. It's very sturdy and easily grabs the ball from the ground. It did take some time to be able to adjust how I threw the ball with it so that it didn't just fly into the ground (I put too much arm swing into it). This toy helps you throw the ball farther than with just your arm and keeps your hands clean. The Chuck It does come in a few different sizes also, depending on the size of your dog. It also comes in a variety of colors. Something else that I like about this dog toy is that the balls come in BRIGHT colors so I never loose them!If you have a dog that likes to play fetch with tennis balls, or a dog full of energy this is the toy for you!
I bought one of these and ended up using it for the neighbor dogs more than my own because of the fact that he would not bring it back to me to throw again. Recently, at the age of 2 he has now realized the point of fetch and loves how far I can throw the ball with this. He plays until he can barely catch his breath, so I have stop and give him breaks, otherwise he would just keep going. Also keeps the slober off you and on the ball where it belongs.
I bought this for my very enthusiastic lab who was OBSESSED with chasing balls. She LIVED to chase a ball. This one was more economical, I didn't have to pay shipping due to Amazon Prime and it was quick delivery. Unfortunately, Maggie passed away at the age of 3 in her prime. She passed due to complications delivering puppies. The breeder offered me another dog. We will be going to get her on Saturday. She will be enjoying it in Maggie's memory. Our new dog won't replace Maggie but she'll fill a hole. God Bless you Maggie !
Both of my Pit Bulls adore this toy.  It's a little shorter than the regular one, but still goes a good distance.  It holds regular tennis balls and anything that size.  When I first started bringing my new dog to the dog park, the Chuck-It was my way to get his attention, and for him to follow me to the exit to leave so I didn't have to chase him down.  It's like it hypnotizes my dogs.  Gives them fabulous exercise too!
I have an 8-pound toy poodle whose passion is fetching balls.  Her mouth is so small she could not get the regular chuckit ball in her mouth and carry it very far.  I ordered this mini-chuckit and though the ball is a little bigger than her very small balls, it works fine and she catches it in her mouth as it's heading toward earth. I have noticed that this mini-chuckit hurles the ball much farther than the regular, which is great because she loves to go far to fetch it.  We use this launcher several times a day and we never get tired of it.  The ball it came with got trashed within a month so I bought Tuff Balls to replace it.  We absolutely love this launcher.  It's fabulous for the beach.  You can't go wrong with this if your little toy dog loves fetching.
We bought this to use in our backyard as it said it was a smaller version to throw the balls a shorter distance.  They weren't kidding.  We have a full-size chuckit and this junior version and this really doesn't throw nearly as far.  I'd say the average adult could throw just as far as this, so we've kind of rotated this out of usage and just use the full-size if going to a park and simply throw the ball by hand if we're in the backyard.  This was a waste of money as you can just use the full-size for shorter distances too and simply not throw the ball as far.
My 8 month old golden loves to chase balls and I have bad rotator cuffs, so I was hoping this would really help me. My backyard is fairly large (1/3 acre) so I expected I would have no problem keeping the ball in our fenced area - wrong! If I use slightly too much &#34;oomph&#34; it goes over the fence, and if I scale it back a titch too much, it goes into the ground 6 feet in front of me. I've had a lot more success out at the dog park where I can let it fly and not worry that I'll send my 60 pound puppy crashing into a fence.
I originally had a large chuck it but it wore out and would not hold the ball in well.So I went to amazon looking for something that would last longer, and found this...I took a chance on it because I did not see this specific model launcher on the chuckit website and the stock photo is photo shopped (shows 2 different model numbers) at the time of purchase there were no reviews.It works and feels a lot less flimsy/flexible than the orange one I originally bought from pet food express...this does however make it a lot more work to launch the ball further..but hopefully it wont wear out.
We have a standard poodle with a ball fetish. She loves (and this is not a strong enough word) tennis balls or anything that can be thrown and returned. We have a large backyard but when I throw the tennis ball (without the Chuckit), she just looks at me with an exasperated, "Really?" The Chuckit allows me to throw the ball clear across our (did I mention large?) yard. I can throw it for a long time without ever getting a sore shoulder or arm and the BEST PART is that I never have to touch a slobbery, muddy ball. Picking the ball up with the Chuckit is very easy, as long as the dog isn't attacking the ball while I'm trying to get it off the ground.This is a highly recommended product. We've had three (ours stay outside and get chewed on and bent by the kids at some point). And I will continue to buy them as others wear out.
This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far, but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too, which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size, but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet, but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this, stop. Add to your cart, get a couple extra balls, and check out.
I've been told I 'throw a ball like a girl.'  It must be true, because when I throw a ball it doesn't go very far (by the way I'm a woman, not a man).  I can't throw very far with this launcher, either, but I know they work well because I watch my neighbor use his Chuck It Ball Launcher for his retriever-type dog and he can the ball to go REALLY far.  I'm up to about 30' myself with the Chuckit, which I admit isn't very far.  But then again, my dog doesn't really 'retrieve' balls anyway, she just runs around with them in her mouth until I go and take the ball from her, so it's just as well.  But whatever, this launcher makes my ball-throwing time with my dog more fun.
First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game, so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like "Why did you throw the ball way over there?" then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch, this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther, and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are "old" they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch.
My family adopted a Golden Retriever who loves to fetch.  Problem is she's a slobbery mess, and I hated touching the balls.  I also can't throw very far when compared to how fast she runs, so games were short, and she wasn't exercising her full potential.Not any more!  I can probably throw the ball 250 feet now, and my dog is huffing and puffing in a few minutes!  I usually play with two balls, one she is fetching, and the other is ready to go when she comes back.  She wasn't very fond of the tennis ball that comes with the launcher, however I ordered some of the orange chuck-it balls and she's doing well with those.  You'll definitely need a large open area to use this though!Definitely worth the money.
I had this item in my cart when I realized it might not be the length handle I was looking for. I read the current reviews and did an online search and scrolled through several pages looking at various websites and found out the 18" handle on the small ball launcher was a 2007 model that has been discontinued, only the 14" handle is available. I have one small ball launcher w/an 18" handle and I'm going to guard it very carefully! I agree w/the other reviews that the shorter handle in the small ball launcher is harder to throw and harder to control and not in the "fun" category. On the other hand the 18" handle for the small balls is completely indispensible! The manufacturer is Canine Hardware and I suggest we send them lots of emails requesting they return the small ball launcher w/the 18" handle. The reviews are correct, the 18" handle is no longer made and ALL small ball launchers are 14" handles.
We use this launcher at a field next to our apartment complex. Our Pembroke Welsh Corgi has a lot of energy and this really helps us throw the tennis ball multiple times really far without throwing out our arms in the process. With minimal effort, you can throw a ball 15ft or so. With a good amount of effort, it will fly as far as 50ft easily. We also like that we can pick up the tennis ball with this Chuckit without having to bend over, as well as getting our fingers all slobbered up. I highly recommend this toy for anyone who has a dog that loves to play fetch and has the space to really run.
We were having a grand time with this toy, and my dog enjoyed running the extra distance.  That was until I handed it over to my boyfriend who &#34;Chucked it&#34; as hard as he could and our tennis ball was lost forever... Ok, so that's not really a problem since you can put whatever kind of tennis ball you want in there, but buyer beware: You must understand physics to avoid losing your dog's favorite tennis ball or possibly chucking a ball into a passing car.  It really depends on where you live.
My pup is in love with this. I had never seen the small launchers in stores however I had the balls so I looked it up online and found this. It is more difficult then it looks and it takes a bit to get use to throwing the ball with this but my pooch is happy now that I can throw his ball much much farther. I was never a good pitcher. Whenever he sees his chuck it he gets excited and starts whining. In fact... He gets excited if he sees anyone's chuck it at the dog park, and that person, has earned a new 7 lb shadow. Brody was more of a keep away dog he would never drop the ball for me easily. So I'd launch the ball with this and feed him a treat in the chuck it launcher itself. Now he gives the ball up every time I have it up for a seamless game of fetch.
Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one.
We have a 8 month old male Doberman that needs lots of exercise and likes to chase a ball unless he gets distracted by a pretty little Boxer, Dalmatian or whatever other female is within 500 feet of him. We have a huge dog park that opened recently near our home and this has been a activity for us to enjoy there. This size might be overkill because you can really send the ball flying but with a little practice it works great and gives you plenty of options. My wife sends the ball about 50 yards and she is petite. I like the fact that I don't have to pick up a ball with slobber all over it anymore.On a side note I recommend using the Chuckit medium Ultra Balls because they are easy to clean and last longer than the fuzzy balls.
I really like this launcher.  It works really well, but I'm thinking of someday buying the longer one.  I opted on this one as the long one indicated it threw farther.  I didn't want to launch it so far I'd lose the ball or end up chasing my dog to get him to come back, so for the length of the throw is perfect and it's very easy to snatch the ball up for continued throwing.  My significant other is 6'1&#34; so he has to do some bending to pick up the balls which is okay for him, but the intention had been to make it easier for him.  One thing I've noticed is that this does not put the stress on my shoulder that thowing by hand thowing does.  This makes our dog, Diego, very happy because he can play and play and play.
sure, i like to strengthen my arm like a pro pitcher but this just makes things so much easier(and cleaner)!! this contraption throws the ball so much farther than I can! Which means my doggie can run much farther too! Which means she gets tired faster! and goes to sleep sooner!! this is the best thing ever created!!!! and when she sees me pick it up(i mean i could just be moving it out of the way) she goes insane!! it also doubles as a water bowl. one day we were outside playing fetch and it was pretty hot. I had my camelbak on but i didn't bring her water bottle. I put the water from my camelbak into the hollow in the launcher and she just drank the water out of that. pretty nifty, eh?
My dog was totally uninterested in the Chuckit balls, so this did not get used a lot.  He does like to fetch his squeaky balls and his crunchy balls, but something about the Chuckit balls (I had 4 different kinds) left him bored. When I did use it, I could not get the balls to fly far like I've seen others.  I'm guessing it was me, not the Launcher.  My dog did, ultimately, like the Chuckit Launcher.  One day, when I wasn't looking, he chewed it up.  It is now one of his favorite chew toys.  Given how long it is lasting, it wasn't such a bad deal.
Fantastic throwing device!  I received this 26M Chuckit in great condition and on time.  The first time I used it I almost threw the ball over the trees into the horse pasture next door.  It is easy to throw the tennis ball close to 75 yards.  This thing really launches the ball with very little effort.  Great for these light weight tennis balls which always seem to bother my elbow when I throw them.  I may actually order the shorter version to reduce overthrown balls. Works great to pick the ball up also.  The ball snaps right into place just as advertised.
My now 9 month old 35 lbs. part Bulldog/ Belgian Malinois pup chews every toy he (and my other dogs and cat) gets.  This was no exception.  I bought Chuckit Tennis balls in hopes that he wouldn't be able to rip it apart.  He ripped them apart very easily.  My 20 lbs. beagle/dachshund mixed dog absolutely adores fetch and retrieve but he started chewing them, too.  As any pug owners knows, the pug wouldn't touch these and doesn't retrieve or fetch anything that is not foodIf you have a chewer, get the Chuck it Fetch it Balls instead of the tennis balls.  I have each kind available and love them all and they are all still intact.
I love the Chuckit!  Let's me throw a ball MUCH farther, for my fetch-crazy dogs, than I can throw by hand!  Also saves me from having to pick up slimy wet balls, since my dogs will drop them at my feet and I just pop the throwing stick over the ball and heave it again.  These replacement balls work perfectly with the throwing stick - my only complaint is that the balls are not as durable as real tennis balls.  The balls that came with the original throwing stick split in half under the abuse my Cattle Dog gave them.  Now he's a senior citizen and has no interest in fetching - so maybe these balls will last longer with the other two Aussie-mix dogs.
I ordered three of these and this item is great, I own an 11 week old German Shepherd puppy that loves to chase a tennis ball and she grows bigger every single day. I was afraid that if I got a ball that was 'her' size that I would not be able to keep it as she grows, but these seem to be just the right size, she can carry it around in her mouth just fine - she was carrying regular ones at 7 weeks!They float and they also bounce great like a normal tennis ball, just bigger. Only time will tell about the durability, but these seem like the right size for large dog breeds to play fetch with in and out of the water.
We have a lab/great dane mix who is obsessed with chewing and chasing balls.  Big stong jaws and teeth on that girl [Abby]  This is about the 10th different ball I have provided her and this is the best.  Its been a couple of months and she is still in love with this ball.  I think she broke through the ball with her teeth [which she always does] but she is keeping it intact.  We put all her balls that survive in one pile and she will go and pick this one out for special attention.  Bigger than a tennis ball, but not too big.  very durable.  easy to throw.  she can't get it as slimy as a regular tennis ball.  Its a good deal
These are the tennis-type balls that come with the original Chuckit thrower.  They're OK, but they don't go the distance or have the "mouth appeal" of the Ultra Chuckit ball.  My yard is littered with these balls and none of my dogs will play with them, only the Ultra ball or various Planet Dog balls.  Plus, according to The Whole Dog Journal, these colorful tennis balls are laden with chemicals that aren't healthy for your dog.  Spend the money on Ultra ChuckIt balls; They cost more but last longer, fly farther, and are easy to clean.This product has been rated by two young Labs (brothers), a Golden Retriever and a Beagle.
My dog loves fetch and I am a huge fan of the Chuckit! launcher, however the tennis balls only seemed to last about a week tops.  The felt disintegrates and then the rubber ball splits into two pieces.  I thought this was just how life was going to be: forever buying these balls for our launcher.  Then a friend told me that they just use regular tennis balls so I tried it.  I bought a pack of 10 cheap-o tennis balls for the same price as I was paying for 2 Chuck it balls and three weeks later we're still using on our first ball- amazing!  It fits perfectly in the launcher and still has felt and bounce.  Thank you, Chuckit! for making the medium sized launcher a standard tennis ball size.  I will happily buy another launcher if my current one ever wears out, but I won't waste my money on these tennis balls.
I have two bichon dogs ages 7 and 5.  My five year old has clicking joints and I thought I'd try these.  So far they're still clicking but both dogs LOVE these treats. I think I'll have to get joint food as well as the treats.  Treats worked before alone.  For the price and how the dogs like these I plan on reordering them.  I break them in half most of the time since they are nice size even with the "small" size.
First Impression: Nutri-Vet heard about my website! They decided to send me a bag of their Peanut Butter flavored biscuits. Well what dog doesn't love peanut butter??? Right now my hips are fine, but I'm a young pup at a mere 13 months. I'm sure as time progresses I'll run into some sore joints, just like all large breed dogs do. So I'm happy to know that there is something out there that can help, and tastes as good as this!Conclusion: Tastes great, no animal bi-products, resealable bag, and it tastes like PB!
The feeding instructions for these biscuits are two/day for 30# dogs.  While it says for &#34;Small and Medium Dogs&#34;, it's strictly for medium dogs; I have two 10# dogs, which means I had to break these into thirds.  And when I tried to break these, these didn't break clean and tended to crumble.  So while they seem to help my dog with her knee issues, I would NOT recommend for small dogs.  If you have a 15# dog, you can break these in half.  Great product for a 30# dog, but not for 10# dogs.
I have 2 cats and one is getting chubby, plus I'm tired of always feeding them regularly.  I needed this for when I was out of town anyway. This is great for feeding them a certain amount of food without overfeeding them. I don't plan on using it for canned food with the ratings I saw on the site. Besides, it's not vacuum packed to keep the canned food from spoiling and the ice packs are kind of cheap on the bottom---a gel that lasts longer than frozen water in them would work better and the manufacturer should have thought of that.
My only complaint is that you need to pop the whole center out before you refill it, or you mess up the timer programming.  It's not super easy to pop back in, but not too hard either.When you pop the timer mechanism back in, make sure you line up the little prong on the timer with the notch on the plastic dish cover's center hole.  If you don't, it won't fully lock into place and kitty might be able to get into the hidden pockets.My cats have stopped screaming at me when it comes close to dinner time; instead, they just wait patiently for the dish to open.  They took to it instantly!
As far as I can tell, it works as advertised. We only used it once while we were gone from the house and my cat didn't eat (stress I think). We have to use wet food though and the ice pack didn't last as long as I'd hoped. We were gone overnight and the ice wasn't cold when we got home, we threw out the food that the cat didn't eat. So if someone can come in to change the ice, it would work. There must be a way to do it where it would last longer, but we've just had someone come feed the cat instead. If someone knows of a way, please let me know!
This product is a great buy for the money.  I shopped around a lot and couldn't find anything to compare.  This is the second one I bought.  I've had the first one almost a year and it's still working.  It is pretty quiet and the timer works well.  My cats don't try to break into it like others seem to do.  It won't work with wet food for 6 days though because the ice will not keep (since it's just water in plastic) but works well for a weekend away.  It has eliminated me having to get up at 4:30am to feed the cats too!
I purchased the product even with all the negative reviews.  First of all to refill the feeder requires really taking the feeder apart...very cumbersome.  However having said this the green light was on.  I turned it on at the time I wanted it to rotate, 7 am every 24 hours.  I had to wait until the next day, well it never rotated.  Also the lid is very easy to move.  I have a Bengal cat, even if the feeder had worked I know he would have easily been able to move it.  I needed the feeder as we are going away.  However I returned it.  I will look for other options.  Unfortunately there really are no other automatic feeders with any consistent good reviews.  Save your time and effort, this product is not worth the trouble
My cats got infested with fleas and I had a hard time getting them under control, as a result I had many outbreaks of tapeworm in my three cats.  The vet bills got expensive after awhile, and since I had learned to identify tapeworm infection, with some research, I deemed these safe.  I am an infectious disease researcher myself, so I do have some experience.  These do work, BUT please ALWAYS check with the veterinarian FIRST before you try to self treat your pets.  The wrong treatment for the wrong diagnosis can lead to damaging consequences.
My cat has gotten tape worm a few times now from being infested with fleas (when a cat gets a flea in its mouth that is infected with tapeworm they get it) and nothing worked! I tried a few different tablets and the only thing I found worked to get rid of them was taking my cat to the vet for a shot which was pricey. Just from taking 1.5 of these pills, my cat's worms were gone and for a fraction of the price of taking them to the vet! Would definitely buy these again if needed!
It works very effectively. I had one of my cats with the tale, tale signs of tapeworms, the rice pods (eggs) in its fecal matter. The gas it passed was enough to make me gag. It was quite unpleasantly odiferous. After 1 day of administration of the medicine, she passed a tapeworm about 9 inches long. So I treated the rest of my cats. They are all fart free. Indications are, if one has tapeworms, the rest do too. Now, time to get some good flea meds for them.
Wanted to try on my own to get rid a my cat's tapeworm. I had seen the white pieces of the worm on her rectum. It was 3 pills.  The first one was wasted, mainly my fault.  The second one was given in a really good treat.  I think she ate most of it.  Have not seen any tell-tell signs on her rectum since then so I am assuming it worked.  The delivery was very fast.  I will use them again.
First of all, this is heavy and bulky.  Those two items are why this is a 4 star item instead of 5.  Having said that, I had no problem lifting or using it.This ramp is superior in every way to another ramp I have.  (The other ramp I have is the Solvit 62337 - it has a sandpaper type finish that is hard to get up if the incline is too steep... say, in a standard SUV.  My dog also FELL off of it NUMEROUS times, hence why I purchased this one).The PetSTEP ramp has a wonderful rubbery texture that makes it easy to walk up and down for a dog.  It is a bi-fold ramp versus a sliding accordian type, but it needs to be for as sturdy as it is.  It stows nicely in the back seat or propped up against the wall in the garage.  The material on this ramp alone makes it worth the price!
Our 90 pound husky just had ACL surgery and I bought this so he could get in and out of the SUV.  It is a great ramp, easy to use, very sturdy, a cinch to unfold and very lightweight.  The tread is very good and provides for sure footing.  We have used it outside over a few steps for him and it has been left outside in the rain overnight.  It is plastic, so being outside doesn't hurt it and the water runs right off it.  I am really happy with it.
This is a great product but too heavy and cumbersome for most women to use without risk of back injury.  While this product has been a lifesaver, I'm currently looking for a lighter product that will work as well as this one.  If you have a suggestion, please leave me a comment.I use this ramp with a hatchback and for storage am able to stand it on its side against the door using a bungy cord to keep it upright.  This saves a lot of room and allows me to carry 3 large dogs in my hatchback with rear seats folded. I previously tried putting it behind front seat but it was awkward to get in and out with back seats folded down.On the plus side, the ramp is sturdy, easy to clean, and the dogs have had no problem using it.  I used the training instructions for my dog, but his companions were motivated just by dog bones.
Bought used - opted for this version of a ramp for my pack of aging herding dogs - 50 # Aussie/BCs and a 75# Bouvier des Flandres - who were beginning to tear my aging back. Made in USA from  heavy duty plastic by the same folks who made the floor mats I got for the truck (Weather Tek). Folds easily. The weight is necessary for the sturdiness I need (plan to throw in the truck bed when not being used). No metal to rust. Textured ramp built in (no peeling). Altogether the ramp is an ideal product I was very pleased to buy at 60% retail cost.
Bought this for our 50-pound dog, for use following surgery, to reduce the risk of post-op hernia.  Trained him on it prior to surgery, since he's used to jumping in and out of the van.  Dog navigated it just fine, even in post-anesthesia haze :-).  Also used indoors to get him on and off the grooming table.  All surfaces are coated, so there's nothing to scratch the vehicle's paint.  When folded, ramp kept closed with a coil spring, protected with a bit of clear tubing.  Simple solution that works just fine.  Notch in rails well-placed to carrying when folded.  Rubber pads help resist slipping off the bumper when the dog is walking the ramp.  Definitely recommend to dog friends.
Our older dog sometimes has trouble jumping into the SUV, so we bought this for him. It was very easy to train both of our two dogs to use this ramp. We have had the opportunity to use this when we go on our long hikes, we are out for hours and have two very tired dogs when we get back. They walk right up the ramp with no problems.I have had the ramp for about two months and I would recommend this ramp as it is easy to use and to train a dog to use it. We keep it in our back seat to always have it handy. I look forward to using this ramp for years to come.
looked into something that was portable AND would hold up in our winter snows.  Been very pleased with this product.  Following their instructions, I got my dog to use it within a few hours.  It has been out in all sorts of weather and seems to be holding up well.  I like that it will not rust, folds easily and quickly, and has rubber strips to give them traction.  Unlike other similar products, this rubber strip seems to be the superior product.  The box it arrived in was damaged but maybe that was it was so bulky.  It was in pristine condition.  This is helping my dog tremendously with her mobility issues.
Pros:Quickly removes ticks from my dog with their head intactHolds ticks in placeCons:Takes a small amount of practice to properly use.You can do the same thing with tweezers with a little extra effort and attention.Often the ticks get stuck in the crack and you will need a toothpick like object to fish them out.Other Thoughts:Many users say they can't remove ticks until after they have fed, I did not experience this. I can remove new ticks as easily as fed ones.The spoon, as I call it, is made of cheap plastic, but feels pretty sturdy since the plastic is fairly thick. It shouldn't break unless stepped on or abused. It is small enough to be easily stepped on if dropped however.I would recommend this and will probably buy another once I get drunk and step on this one.
Love this tick remover!I lived in an area with tons of ticks and my dogs were always getting them. It was disgusting to try and pick them off by hand, and using tweasers was gross because it squeezes the tick and leaves the head half the time. Then the whole match thing never worked for me either.I found this tick remover at the counter of a pet store- took it home to test it out- and voila! Works great. I've had no problems, and it works effortlessly every time for me. Just have to "scoop" the tick and the tool actually lifts the tick out (the whole tick! no head left behind). Once you get the right scoop technique it will never fail you.Such a stupid idea really, it's basically a teaspoon with a notch cut out, but I couldn't live without it!(& p.s. I have a Siberian Husky with super long hair, and a Great Dane with short hair - so it works great on everyone).
I used to only buy Science Diet. Knowing my elderly special needs cat did not like his dry food; I decided to buy a bag of this. Big mistake.He did not like it and after a few days I noticed the cat food dispenser was very greasy! I decided to give it to another house cat I have, same results, she did not like it.I am the caretaker of a feral cat colony. I have tried it on 7 feral cats and they are not even crazy about it. They eat it but not eagerly. I poured the bag in a food bin and every time I scoop it out, there is oil in the scooper and also on the plate. It is heavy with oils. It even smells disgusting.Sadly after trying this out on nine different cats, I have to say I would not buy this again. Try a sample locally or buy a smaller bag if you can. Not a hit here at all.
This cat food contains a lower level of magnesium than the "supermarket" cat foods. Low magnesium levels help to prevent urethra problems, especially in male cats due to their more narrow urethra. I would rather pay the higher price for this brand of cat food than bring my cats to an emergency vet in the middle of the night because their urinary tract gets blocked, not to mention the aggravation caused to the cat. Other brands of low magnesium cat food include Iam's and Nutro-Max. Hill's Science Diet food is round-shaped, rather than "hooked", which makes it easier for one of my older tooth-challenged cats to swallow.
We have a kitty with some urinary issues. He developed unprinted crystals, a precursor to kidney stones (vet said it probably felt like peeing shards of glass). He was certainly letting us know, so nobody was happy. (Of course, I was glad he let us knows and even happier when we got it worked out).Here's what we learned. Cat food has to have a balance of specific vitamins/minerals and if the amounts are out of whack, cats are very prone to urinary problems. We had switched to Spot's Stew, an &#34;all natural&#34; food, and it gave our little dude some major problems. Apparently Science Diet is one of the best companies for studying and developing formulas for urinary issues, and behold, we have had NO issues since switching. Can I get an amen?!?!?The price point on the big bag is also excellent, if you do much comparison shopping in the stores. So, everybody is happy!!
I found two young female cats wondering around my neighborhood and eventually caught them, their fur was rough and dirty from malnourishment and the harsh weather. After a bath and some good science diet cat food, they're as healthy as can be! Their fur is soft and their teeth are so healthy! I also leave a bowl of science diet cat food for the other two feral cats that don't want to be caught. I will not be taking my two new kitty cats off this food, they love it to much!
each time I give up on the high cost and feed my cats another brand, it takes less than 2 weeks to see the difference in their coats and weight.  They eat way more of the lesser brands and they poop 80% causing litter demand to double.  They eat much less on Science Diet.  I have a personal kitty rescue ranch, no help from anywhere so must watch every penny and cut corners  every way possible.  I find this to be the ultimate food...even if it smells bad.  :)
I have tried several dog foods for my puppy. this is the only brand and type that he seems to love. my puppy had an issue with eating his poo, so i tried all these other brands and he would continue to eat it. i finally put him on this and sucess! he stopped eating his poo and he eats all his food. i have also given him other science diet wet food with the meat and gravy but he doesnt like it. of note,  this food  will make your dogs poo extra stinky. which is good so he wont eat it but bad for when you pick it up.
I don't use small cans like Fancy Feast, so I cannot comment on those. However, I like these because they LAST. I bought them at a pet food store which no longer carries them, probably because they are so expensive.Except for a lid I bought at least 15 years ago labelled Sargeant's, these are the sturdiest. The more flimsy ones always end up getting a crack in them and are not always tight.For me, the 4 stars, not 5, is because they seem expensive. However, on Amazon, it seems that most of the can covers are more expensive than you would want to pay. It's the S & H that is outrageous.
I read the reviews on this and was hesitant to give it a try because of reviewers who said it was so hard to get the off once they got it on.  These lids are very hard to find so I decided to give it a try and, for me, it worked great.  It easily went on and came off of 5.5 and 3 oz cans of cat food and 12.5 oz cans of dog food.  However, as one reviewer pointed out, after they've been in the fridge they clan be a little harder to remove.  Running a little hot water over the lid while it's still on the can restores the flexibility and it will pop right off.  They're great.  I'm ordering more.
My kitten eats plenty of wet food, and was on 3oz cans for quite some time. This cover sealed those cans, and it was not difficult to remove. A lot of people have reviewed this stating it's too hard to remove from a 3oz can - if it were any easier I'd be worried that it wasn't sealed. The coolest thing about this cover is that now that my kitten is on 5.5oz cans, the same exact cover can seal her food.Only negative is that I was fooled by the photo into thinking I was getting two covers - you only get one.
My miniature schnauzer LOVES this toy. This is my second one buying (not because it broke- because it has gotten so nasty) He drags it with him EVERYWHERE. We have to make him drop this toy. The only downside is if you have hardware floors, this toy WILL scratch them so be careful... My boxer likes this toy as well but not as much because her teeth are alot smaller. I would recommend it for a dog with bigger teeth. I have noticed an improvement in his gum strength. I have had to brush his teeth less since getting this toy and he LOVES it!!! I cannot say enough how much my dog loves this toy. Also, while crate training he used to chew his bed, but once we got this toy he has not touched his bed. If we leave his toy out of his crate, his bed is chewed again........ LIFE SAVER!!!!!!!! Love Nylabone, love this dinosaur!
My dog got this last year for christmas and its still around and intact, I was worried when after a few days of having it I noticed it had blood on it but he is an obsessive chewer and that soon stopped. Some people have complained about the heads or tails breaking off but mine is still intact. He loves this thing. The only issue I have with it is that now all the little spots on it are sharp and he likes to leave it right in my walking path. I can't help but think he does it on purpose.
My Malinois / Husky loves Nylabones. He has gone through one of the "souper" bones and is working on another one. I got him this and noticed it was considerably smaller, so he has already chewed off the head and tip of the tail - but it keeps him busy, cleans his teeth and he enjoys it.UPDATE: After a few weeks with this toy I have noticed my dog is able to chew off larger pieces (more specifically the legs) and I have had to take them away for fear of him swallowing them whole. I have also noticed some sharper edges on this bone not only from him chewing, but also the texture of the dinosaur. He has cut himself on it once, but I only realized it when I saw blood on it and inspected his mouth. So, no more of these dinos for me!
This is one of the 2 toys that have survived my puppy's teething phase. The rest are history. I have a female lab retriever, and this is the toy she prefers when her teeth hurt. She doesn't chew on it hard enough to break it, but you can tell it's losing its texture. I think it's a great toy that will last a long time =)UPDATE 3/17/2014: This is one of the few toys that has survived my lab retriever! It's losing its texture (from all the biting) but it hasnt been broken :) Very recommended!
My dog destroys ANY toy he gets, so I have to be very picky when I do buy him something. Most Nylabone products are safe (we have had some bad experiences with some) but this one is great! I have a puggle who is 30 lbs and he just loves this. I was happy to see a new toy added by Amazon in the nylabone division, and it is a great price. At $5, I can replace these often enough when my dog starts to wear them down. He loves the dinosaur however, he carries it around with him everywhere!
I was very disappointed in the "regular" Nylabones - my 20 pound dogs chewed them into sharp, dangerous chunks within a matter of minutes.  I was wary of Nylabone products after that, but the durable ones have turned out to be great, and I'll only buy durable from now on.  My dogs like the bone-shaped durable Nylabones, but they LOVE these dinosaurs.  They never seem to get tired of chomping on them.  They do wear down, but slowly and in tiny pieces that appear to be harmless.  After about a month of three dogs working on two dinosaurs, the toys are missing their heads, but there's plenty more to chew on.  Their irregular shape makes them easy to hold onto and fun to go at from different angles.  My house will never be without these things.
This is a TERRIBLE dog toy. We received the Stegasaurus version of the toy. The &#34;seams&#34; from the plastic mold are incredibly hard and actually sharp. Unfortunately I gave this to the dog without first investigating it and he quickly began bleeding from cut gums. Even if you &#34;shaved&#34; those off, the Stegasaurus's wide, awkward shape is bad for a medium or small dog at least. The hard bumps all over the outside seam weird. If they were softer, I could see how it would be a gum-massage but these are super hard.
I erroneously assumed that I'd get what was shown in all the photos - a T-Rex.  The listing title says &#34;dinosaur varies&#34; and the listing points include &#8226;Available in Brontosaurus, Stegosaurus and T-Rex.  There wasn't an option for me to choose, and I wish it had been clearer to me that the packers would chose what toy I was sent; I would have purchased this from a different shop.Instead of a T-Rex, I got a brontosaurus with a long thin neck that looks like it would be easy to chew off.  My dog doesn't care what dino he got. But the Rex shape looks a lot more durable.
These are a great price, and my dogs can't get enough of them!  I give them as gifts occasionally to friends with dogs, and they find their dogs love them as well.  I highly recommend.  I have two German Shepherd mixes (one with jaws of steel I think) and they stand up to the test.  Eventually they are worn down to nothing, but that usually takes 2 or 3 months, even with my more active chewer.Warning though, you don't want to step on these in the middle of the night!
My two terrier mixes (20 lbs. and 32 lbs.) love to chew, and their paws-down favorites over the past five years have been Nylabone Dental Dinosaurs. We go through 2-3 sets per year and have have no problems, with the exception of an occasion bit of gum bleeding (very slight) when someone gets a bit carried away. Well, that, and having to confiscate the toys when we're trying to sleep, since their chewing enjoyment is a bit too noisy for nighttime!After months of use, I take the worn down toys away and replace them, and I regularly check to make sure there are no sharp edges or larger parts that look as if they could break off and be ingested.If you have a dog that loves chewing, I've say to give them a try, at first with supervision. If your dogs are like mine, these toys will offer many hours of entertainment and cleaner teeth to boot.
She loves this dinosaur...seriously loves it.  She has many shapes of the Nylabone products--this guy however is by far her favorite.  The head, feet, tail--all chewed off, only the center body is left.I like these because they are designed to massage gums, clean plaque from teeth and as a doggie bonus, they are flavored.  I do recommend the dinosaur in particular on her behalf--she can't type but from the rate of chew, this is a good one.
I got this for my beagle pup as she cannot stop chewing.  I've purchased nearly every chew toy Amazon sells and finally got this.  It was too hard for my 11 week old puppy.  She check it out, mouthed it and never touched it again.  Maybe when she gets larger....Meanwhile, my 8 year-old son loves dinosaurs and wanted it.  So, now it's his.  He knows he might be able to give it up one day, but I don't think I will be able to get it back.
The pup liked this toy very much, but I do not recommend if you have any type of carpet in your house.  We don't even have carpet - just a few wool rugs, but the toy was soon the most disgusting thing in our house.  All the rug fibers and dirt and slobber matted around the nubs on this toy, making it very unpleasant to touch.  We tossed it outdoors, and it wasn't much better.  Those nubs grab everything gross and use slobber as glue to make sure that it stays that way.
After reading the negative reviews about broken teeth and other issues, I'm kind of relieved that none of my dogs have shown any interest in this chew.  I even tried coating it with yummy stuff (peanut butter, etc.) to get my dogs to take interest, but they'll only lick the coating off and then leave the chew.  My dogs are all mixes of German Shepherd, Rottweiler, Pit Bull, and Border Collie, so it should say something that they will have nothing to do with this item.  I'm tired of stubbing my toe on it after having it around the house unused for over a year.  It's going in the trash.
My dogs have a variety of Nylabones and one from Hartz as well and they all get chewed on depending on what my boys are in the mood for.  They regularly compete to be the one to get dinosaur, so I would rank that as this one being a favorite.  Both my dogs are heavy chewers, but the nylabones seem to last a good long while and they never get tired of them.  One other thing, the dinosaur (with all the little nubs) is probably the most horrible thing to step on when making a trip to the bathroom in the middle of the night!
I normally buy the Large, super durable Nylabones for my 35lb shepherd mix.  However these were on sale so I decided to give one a try.  Both of my dogs LOVED this bone as soon as it arrived.  However, it is much smaller and softer than the bones I normally buy, and it did not take long at all before it had been chewed into something to small for my dog to safely continue chewing  on.  If you have smaller dogs who don't have a shepherd's powerful jaw, then this bone is for you.
My bullies love Nylabones, they are the one thing that they do not destroy! I got them these & the big smooth bone 2 pack for Christmas. Those were a big hit, these they don't seem to like. I do not know if it's the flavor or texture . . . They have the big smooth heavy bone looking Nylabones which they like okay, they have the BIG nubby ones which they love, so I thought they would like these but they looked at them, chewed on them a little & left them for the big smooth flavored ones in the 2 pack. Those they chew on daily along with the big nubby ones. Maybe it's the flavor. They have Nylabones that are 3 years old!
I loved the idea of the dinosaur chew toy for my dog and couldn't resist buying him one. I do wish they would give you a choice in the dinosaur type, but random selection isn't terrible. The 3 types shown online are all pretty cute. We received the brontosaurus. My dog weighs 30 pounds and a big chewer. He loves his other Nylabone bone chews, but has not really gotten into his dino chew. I think something about the bumps on the exterior put him off it. He likes to move it around the room and carry it places but has not chewed on it much at all. Sometimes I find him just licking it. We've had it almost two weeks. Maybe once the new has worn off he will chew on it more. He does seem to like it and will carry it places which is pretty funny. Overall I am happy with the purchase.
My dog loved the dinasaur chew toy THAT IS SHOWN IN THE ADVERTISEMENT.  Unfortunately that is not the chew toy that was received.  The substitution was white and I believe was a taradactal.  It is all angular and sharp points. My dog wouldn't even touch it.  She even know the difference.This looks like a cheap substitution and I am upset that you just assume that we wouldn't know the difference.  I left all of them at the dog park in case some other dog would want them.  From now on DO NOT SUBSTITUTE without advising in advance.  Very upset with this kind of business practice.  All nylabone products ARE NOT equal.
These chews are great. My dachshund-mix 3-month-old puppies were not too interested in the classic nylabone so I got these, and they just LOOOVE them. It's their #1 chew-toy. They can sit in their beds and chew on it forever. I also recommend the Nylabone fish. For some reason the funky shapes and textures are just much more enticing than the regular bone shape. One more note: to get them really hooked on Nylabones I've found that I have to hold the toy for them to chew on at first (so they build really positive associations with it: bone='mom'), at the beginning of a chewing session, and then they're hooked. Don't necessarily expect your dog to just chew it without any of your involvement. The more you're involved, the more he'll enjoy it!
I placed an order couple days ago and it arrived yesterday. Very impressed that it got here super quick especially on a Saturday. I was really hoping to get the T-Rex chew toy but got the Stegosaurus instead. The choice is random, you can't pick what dinosaur you want which is kind of a bummer. I was reading through many of the reviews and they were mixed between positive/negative, so I decided to purchase it to see what it was like for myself.I thought it was actual bone material but quickly discovered it to be plastic with &#34;little bumps&#34; on it. My dog is a very aggressive chewer and she hasn't chewed through it. She seems to enjoy it very much and so far, there's no cracked or broken teeth! *knock on wood* I'm not too pleased that the chew toy is plastic though. Probably won't purchase again as it could be hazardous to my dog's teeth.
At least 1 out of 2 dogs enjoys it periodically.  It definitely doesn't get chewed down.  The material is very, very hard and I had my doubts about it and the dogs teeth,.  However both walmart and petsmart carry tons of nylabone stuff so I figured iT HAd to be alright or there would have been recalls.  Me I don't like it, but the dog does and since she doesn't chew on it obsessively, unlike other things I'm not too worried about her teeth.
I have a 3 year old english/american bulldog mix that loves chewing on nylabones/dingos. I bought this product selfishly, because I like dinosaurs. Unfortunately, the littel nubs tore into her gums like nobody's business and left sharp shards sticking out. She only had it for a short time under (sort of laxed) supervison, but when i looked down the thing's entire tail was covered in blood. Into the trash it went. Moving forward, I will stick to the non-nubby nylabones.
I have a medium sized dog (king charles / bichon mix) and he is a big time chewer.  He's been working on this for over 6 months now and he's done some damage to the tail but still has not lost interest in it.  The only &#34;con&#34; I can think of for this toy is that it does have a large collection of sharp points which I suppose is great for teeth cleaning but a pain in *ss when you step on it running to the bathroom in the dark at 3am. :)
My dog loves this toy.  It's the one chew toy he actually goes to again and again.  I would give it 5 stars, but I looked down one day and the toy was headless.  Where the head went I have a pretty good guess.  So, I would recommend the toy with the caveat that if your dog is a determined chewer that you probably shouldn't leave him unsupervised with the toy for extended periods of time (such as the amount of time it would take him to behead it).
I bought this for my 10lb mini doxie and she has little to no interest in it. It's super rock hard! I may try to put some peanut butter on it to make it more appealing but probably will give it to my parents' golden retrievers to see if it interests them. Also, I was unable to choose which dinosaur shape I wanted at checkout. Kind of inconsequential but I really wanted the Tyrannosaurus Rex! Instead I got the Stegosaurus. Perhaps that's why she doesn't like it :)
My dog is around 6 pounds, and he does not really pay much attention to this toy. I really only bought it for him because his name is Rex and I thought it would be funny. (They did not send a T-rex, just a warning -- they send you a random one!) I knew they were gonna send a random one but I had hoped for a T-Rex. That is not why I give it an okay rating though. My dog just does not seem to care for it, but maybe a larger dog would!
Careful people! Even though this chew toy says for powerful chewers, it also says for dogs up to 50 lbs in VERY tiny print on the bottom of the package. I gave it to my 79 lb Lab Mix puppy anyway, since I had already bought it... and lo and behold, it began falling apart in only a few moments.After removing the toy and picking up the white bits all over... I thought to come here and warn people. I find it odd how it's for powerful chewers yet only includes medium sized dogs in the toy description! With pit bull terriers and a few other smaller breeds as an exception... usually smaller dog means less destructive chewing ability. Senseless, really.If you have a dog that falls under this weight category... except for a breed with very powerful jaws, this toy probably suits just fine, but if you have a large dog, don't even think about it. I paid almost $9 for a toy that begun to disintegrate within a few seconds.
I was disappointed in this one - Nylabone Durable toys are the only toys I buy for my powerful chewers because they are the most durable I've found to withstand their chewing. This one did not live up to the Nylabone Durable name. I gave it to one of my dogs, who is not the most aggressive chewer in the pack and I had to take it away from him the first day because he was able to destroy part of it and chew off pieces.  I will go back to the Nylabone Durable Souper bones from now on!
It all depends on whether your dog likes it or not. My friend's dog chews up toys within a day or two of getting them. He has this one still after several months. The head is gone, but the rest is intact. My boyfriend's dog, however, only picks it up when she knows I'm waiting for her to play with it. My only complaint is that when your dog is carrying it around, if he scrapes up against you with the little nubs can be pretty sharp.
We have two lab mixes. The youngest is still very much in puppy stage and boy does he love to chew! We had given him rawhides to keep his focus on something appropriate to chew, but he was going through too many rawhides. I saw nylabones in petsmart in the heavy chewers section. The first plain bone went over well. So I ordered more on Amazon. I'm so glad I did! These were the best solution to keep our chewer occupied! He loves all the different shapes and flavor toys that they have! Thank goodness for nylabones!
I bought this quite a while back. At first my dog didn't take to it, but it's now one of her old go-to toys. Why 2 stars? This thing gives  my dog an unfair advantage in the house. If we're playing 'chase', this is the only toy I can never get away from her because it hurts my hands to hold on to. She also leaves it in strategic locations as to cause the bare foot the most damage. Overall, it's a good toy for a dog and not a person.
This is possibly one of the best toys we got for our dog. He's a 55 pound pit bull mutt and he is constantly chewing on the toys we get him. Even the toys that claim they are indestructible inevitably get destroyed by him. Not this one. We have had it the longest out of any toy we have given him, and the best part about it is that it also helps clean his teeth because of the little bumps all over it. If you have a dog who is constantly destroying any toys you give him or her, get this and you won't be disappointed. While it's worth noting that no toy is ever completely indestructible, this one has withstood the test of time and is still going on, even though he has chewed a bit off of it.
A friend of mine has a Border Collie who is a ruthless and devout chewer, who absolutely adores this toy. But, my Aussie is more of a fetcher than a chewer so although he'll have his moments with it, it's not his go to chew toy. Which is the only reason it lacks full stars for myself. But, despite my dogs personal preferences, as a product this is a great chew toy. If your dog has a tendency to chew through anything and everything for hours on end, I would absolutely recommend this to you.
Our Aussie, Iggy, is an extreme chewer, and this $5 bone is worth it.  It's smaller than I had expected but, even after a month Iggy has only destroyed the head.  She will happily chew on this (when we redirect her).  The first couple times she used it her spit was pink so I think her gums might have bled a little, but that stopped.  We will be purchasing more Nylabones as they are so affordable, long lasting, CLEAN, (unlike rope toys that can be distributed throughout your house fiber by color fiber) and enjoyable chew toys found.Caution: stepping on this toy in the dark can bring a full grown person to their knees.  Use care when left out (or always wear slippers)
My dalmatian just loves her dino. it was her fav nylabone that she got for christmas. the only thing i don't like is that the ends are easy for her to chew up and become sharp but other than that it is holding up well. she is a power chewer and we haven't had any problems with it breaking apart (note-she is only allowed to use most of her toys under supervision. just incase). she also has a large slection of treats and a couple of kongs so she doesn't chew on just one toy all day.
My 6 month old, 45 lb puppy is a super aggressive chewer and likes Nylabone products. She was really interested in this one, HOWEVER, the plastic is not durable and basically becomes a sharp, flaking mess! This chew piece (&#34;for powerful chewers up to 50 lbs&#34;) is NOT good. It made my dogs gums & lips irritated and now she has a big, pink, patchy sore on her lip - which looks like a rug burn - from her lip rubbing up on the distorted, sharp plastic of this T-REX. We were so excited to get a new chew, but it's awful! I took it away and her lip & gums are healing. I suggest Nylabone take this  product OFF the Market. We're sticking to Elk & Deer Antlers, hooves & other natural chews from now on! THUMBS DOWN, NYLABONE. =(
I have three dogs.  Two cocker spaniels and a jack russell terrier.  None of them like this toy.  They have had several Nylabone toys, but this one is the least favorite.  Each of them tried it out, but they all got bored with it fast.  It is very heavy and the points are somewhat sharp.  That may not be what turns my dogs off though because they have had other textured toys.  After handling it myself, I would be worried about it being to coarse and causing bleeding gums or injuring their teeth.
Even for dogs that are 'hard chewers', this toy is wonderful!  Yes, they can,, and will, eventually wear down parts of the toy {esp the head and tail} from gnawing on it, but it doesn't break off into small pieces as some toys can.  I've used this for big and small dogs, and they all love it equally!  I think the 'bumps' on the surface of the toy help stimulate the teeth/gums, and it must feel good when they chew on it.  Great toy!
Our dog was moving from moderate to heavy chewing around the time we got this, darn thing lasted all of 2 hours as our lab pup ripped into the head and tail of the stegosaurus that showed up in the package. It says this can stand up to hardy chewers so not sure if we received the incorrect dinosaur or whether there is no truth in this advertising. I don't recommend this product if you pup is anything close to a remote chewer and/or over 45 lbs. I didn't bother returning it or making a big deal since other Nylabone products have worked out well for us so this one probably just needs to be calibrated lower in terms of durability and rated for less than moderate chewers. The entire dinosaur is too small as well and I was worried he would actually swallow the darn thing
I have a large dog who's normally very soft-mouthed and doesn't destroy his toys -- he has cloth chew ropes and fuzzy animals that are several years old at this point.He went through this dinosaur like an eight-year-old through Christmas morning, though. Chewed it absolutely to bits in just a few weeks, and it came apart into twisted, jagged chewed bits that I feared might present a choking hazard.Might just've been him -- he has strong jaws, he just normally doesn't use them: something about this toy triggered his destructive lust, though. Not sure if that's good or bad from his point of view, but from mine this didn't hold up as well as I was hoping.
I thought this would be a little bigger, but that's okay since my American Pitbull Terrier is only 5 months right now, and my Ridgeback mix is medium sized. This is a great size for small-medium Dogs. It's an interesting shape and my Moms cairn terrier mix female claimed it right away! Haha. It's textured for teeth cleaning and strong for super chewers! As with any hard chew toy, do keep an eye on your pet while they chew so they don't hurt a tooth. Ive heard that this can be a problem.
For some odd reason I thought these were chewable, which clearly they're not. I'm not exactly how sure the dental part works in, I haven't noticed better breath or less tarter. It's a hard plastic toy, luckily for me my dog knows better than to eat the pieces she chews off, she just spits them out. If your dog isnt that way I wouldnt recommend as it could do inner damage or atleast monitor your dog. Im giving the product 4 stars because it did arrive earlier than expected, it does keep my dog entertained, shes more interested in chewing this toy than furniture. She seems happy with it so im happy.
My cat Foutchie is heading toward 5 now and no one told her the trouble with a kitten is it eventually becomes a cat (so take that Ogden Nash!).  She still voom-voom-vooms around at a pace that makes me exhausted.  She loves toys, especially stuff she chases.  So the bubbles are great full.  Especially since they are catnip bubbles.  You don't have the worry about them getting soap on them and making them sick.  She love jumping high to pop them.So if you are looking for something to awaken the kitten in your kitty, you might try these.
I'm disappointed to say that there are very few bubbles, mostly very tiny and they pop as soon as they touch something.  I gave it a thorough test, blowing air at different speeds and angles, shaking the bottle before using and then using it when it hasn't been shaken in a couple of days, etc.  Total letdown.Important to note: both I and another person who gave this a shot felt stinging in our eyes when the bubbles popped close to our faces.  Not good!!!
My male cat loves these bubbles, but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell, but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip...
Please note that though my dogs are capable of ripping this or any fabric toy to shreds, for reasons only known to them, they don't do this. (a Big Retriever Mix & a giant Great Pyrenees mix). This squeaky duck is their favorite for fetch and the toy each consistently chooses to initiate a few rounds of big dog wrestle-rumble. The squeaker holds up to a lot of use and this toy does just fine when run through the washer & dryer, if you find your pup or pups tend to &#34;suck&#34; their stuffed animals and thus render them totally funky.
I've never seen this at the pet stores and our border collie adores them.  He is 7 and has all of his since puppyhood - in varying stages of ick since he plays with them outdoors.  Unfortunately, he likes the old "duckie" better than a nice new one.  They've held up amazingly well, especially compared to another, pricier, toy from a pet store that started coming apart at the seams immediately.  No duckie ever did that.  He's had some other stuffed toys but these are such a favorite that I've kept a spare. He enjoys the squeaks too although a couple did stop working.
This is my second review for Duckworth and I still feel that this duck is worth every penny. It was the favorite toy of our dog that died at age 13 and it is the favorite toy of our 5 yr old dog that we adopted after the first one died. The dogs couldn't be more different in personality, but they both have loved this toy to pieces, literally. It doesn't get chewed apart but is so well loved that it looks terrible and is starting to fall apart, so we buy two each Christmas and save the second one for mid summer when it is time for a new Duckworth to appear.
Purchased this for our 8 year old stuffed animal collector Hailey the Farm Dog. Hailey is not a toy destroyer (quite the opposite) and while she has given Duckworth many a massive shake, she mainly appreciates the texture of the fur (good for licking and nurturing) and the ability to provide the perfect chin rest for naps! Duckworth seems to be of excellent quality although we have not washed him so I cannot give an opinion of how well he would hold up under those conditions. My suspicion is that Duckworth is NOT for a power chewer and we have taught our terrier to leave it alone :-)
I bought this toy for my puppy but didn't give it to him until months later because although he likes big toys (it's big for him, he's a 20 pound dog), he also loves squeakers or toys that make fun sounds but this one only has 1 squeaker. When I gave it to him, I thought it would just be a 1 day toy and he would be done with it but 2 months later, this is still his absolute favorite toy. He loves the 1 squeaker and carries his ducky around all the time. This is also one of the few toys he knows by name and will pause and look around every time he gets asked where his ducky is. And he also loves cuddling with his ducky and uses it as a pillow when he sleeps.
I have 7 dogs...all different sizes and breeds.  I make agravy paste and add it over their dry food.  Every single one of them gulps this stuff down -- I've never had ALL of them love anything as much as this before!  It looks nasty when mixed (think dirty diaper), smells like beef gravy, but it certainly does the trick. Two of my dogs have arthritis and they seem to be improving (I also give them fish oil and glucosamine).  My beagle has gone from being barely able to stand up to running around and playing.  I'm waiting to see if it helps with the tear stains on my Bulldog's face.  Too soon to tell.  But they all love it and for that reason alone, so do I.
My dogs absolutely love the taste of this stuff.  It makes a wonderful smelling gravy.  I love the fact that I don't have to give them anything else besides this in addition to their dry food.  I don't know if my dogs would eat their plain food again without this mixed in.  I haven't noticed that much difference in their overall health, but they were already in great condition before giving this to them.  I just hated having to mix lots of different supplements and yogurt and so on every time I fed them.  This makes it wonderfully easy to keep them healthy.  And Amazon has the best prices to buy this.
I had my dog on this for a couple months and noticed a wonderful bloom in his coat but also noticed his ears began to be unusually smelly. I feed my dog raw so he doesn't get grains anywhere. I checked the product closely and noticed the ingredients label listed flax seed. Took him off Nupro and his ears cleared up. We now stay away from anything with flax. After adding raw green tripe to his diet, I am noticing similar positives. It is a shame, Nupro is otherwise a great product. I would recommend it to others whose dogs are more tolerant of flax.
I have 2 labs, one of whom had bowel surgery at 5 months and lost part of his intestines. This affects his ability to absorb the nutrients in his food. I started adding this and the Nupro Joint supplement to both of my dogs food. The LOVE this stuff. It makes a nice gravy that my dogs just adore. I can't get them to stop licking the bowl when their food is gone.I have no idea if it's helping or not but the pup is healthy and growing and gaining weight. I can't ask for more than that. The fact that this does not have a noxious odor is a HUGE plus for me. It seems to be made with healthy ingredients and is chock full of nutrients. At the very least, it can't hurt so I give it to both dogs.
I first won a 5-pound can of Nupro at a collie specialty show. The person who donated the gift commented, "This stuff will grow hair on eggs!" Funny. But I've used it for several years ever since that first can, and my collie's coat is gorgeous. This is a great product. My dog is 9-1/2 yrs old, looks about 4, and acts like a puppy. (You can see him at [...].) I won't stop adding this to his food.
No matter how good the nutritional value is, or how good it smells, it's no good if the dog won't eat it, and mine won't.  I am SO disappointed.  I tried mixing it in warm water to make a gravy.  Smelled great.  He hated it.  I then tried heating the &#34;gravy&#34; to really mix the powder into the HOT water.  I let it cool.  Put it on his food.  Hated it.  Next I tried it dry, just sprinkled on top.  He hated that, too.  The good news is that my brother's Rottweiler loves it.  But he loves anything!  I wanted this supplement because I am concerned about my fussy eater.  Unfortunately, it didn't help ME, at all.
I have been using the Missing link skin & coat for my bulldog. She was diagnosed with a nutrition deficiency even after eating $50 a bag dog food for years. The missing link helped but it was expensive. So when I saw this 5lb tub I jumped on it. Here is the issue, the dose of the Nutri-pet is 2 scoops a day. The missing link is 1/4 of a scoop a day. This 5lb tub did not last very long.I don't know if it really helped my dog. Her skin conditions still seems to come back every few months. This was only a 1 month supply for my 50lb dog. So once the tub was empty I went back to Missing Link, the 5lb bag is a little more expensive but lasts 6 months or more.
I have two dogs, a Boston terrier and a maltese mix and I have been making home made dog food for them for almost three years now. Their meals include protein (meat or chicken), oats, a variety of vegetables and sweet potatoes. My vet recommended that I include a supplement such as this and fish oil in their meals. Since I have been feeding my dogs home cooked meals, my Boston who is now seven has a lot less grey hair on his face, both dogs (my maltese is six) still act like they are young dogs, and they are both in very good health. While I can't attribute this to the powder completely, I do think it works and I don't see any reason to change their diet now. Also, both dogs seem to like the taste, so that's a plus.
I bought this product to supplement my Siberian husky&#8217;s home cooked diet that is supplemented with high quality kibble.  We have been adding Nupro to her 3 daily meals for nearly 2 months now and her coat is noticeably smoother & shinier.  Previously she had hotspots around her mouth from licking; Nupro has almost totally alleviated this.  Shockingly, she turned the powder down at first (we have read reviews that said dogs couldn&#8217;t refuse the smell/flavors) but now we mix the powder with water and top it onto her food and she can&#8217;t get enough.  This is a great product for anyone looking for a top quality dog food supplement.
I first heard about this product when my beagle was dying from mast cell cancer. A blog I came across recommended I give this to her. While she didn't make it, I couldn't help but notice the shiny coat this product gave her. I now feed this to my golden retriever, and I have from 8 weeks of age. He LOVES the stuff, and he definitely sheds less when on Nupro. One thing I've noticed, however, is when starting him on a batch of this stuff (after a few months of hiatus), his breath will REEK. I'm not sure what to do about it ... as the Orapup doesn't seem to take the smell away. After a few weeks, however, his breath is back to normal. Very good product! Highly recommended.
I have been using Nupro Dog Supplement for about a year now.  Originally, I was making my own dog food and needed a supplement.  Now I have found a dry dog food that my fussy-stomached German Shepherd can eat.  I still add Nupro to his and my other dogs food daily.  I can say for sure that it helps for a shiney coat, but mostly I feel confident that my dogs are getting all the nutritional benefits that they need. I have found no adverse effects and my dogs absolutely LOVE love it! Sometimes I just make a gravy out of the Nupro as a special treat for my dogs.
Our dogs love it.  We rescued two woofs and one of them was severely abused.  Mange, fungal infection, abuse, no fur...horrible skin.  Dr. told us that he probably wouldn't get his fur back.  The rescue folks suggested Nupro Gold as they've seen wonders with this product.  It's hard to say if his fur would have grown back on it's own (and some of it on his face did not return) without the supplement, but we did use it and his coat is now beautiful.  We are continuing to use it.
I have 2 Basenjis.  Our 1st one started losing his hair in circles with little scabs underneath.  We took him to the vet 5 times, scrapings were done, negative, blood & stool, negative.  He was looking very puny, my gorgeous red/white Basenji.  On top of this we were waiting for the day we would become parents to a Basenji pup.  However, we had an amazing breeder, and he told us about Nupro gold, and we promised to continue with it in his diet.  Naturally we  followed directions for Charley.  Miraculously within a month his coat was back more beautiful than before.  I recommend this to all dog owners.  My dogs love the taste.  It is keeping my boys in great shape.
I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving, likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out.
I haven't used the product long enough to evaluate whether or not it will help my dog's hip dysplasia, however I can tell you that it has caused HORRIFIC gas. Bad enough that I had to put my dog out of my room in the night (wher he usually sleeps) because it was almost gagging me and was hard to breathe. He has not had a diet change, the only thing changed is I added this supplement to his regular food, so it's obviously the supplement causing the gas. Not sure how long I can handle the gas, but I will give it some more time to see if it helps his hips, as he really needs that.
I have been giving this to my 2 dogs for about a month and their hair is so much softer than before. My pug hair was kind of rough on the back and now it has become super soft. My boxer hair has become shinier as well but i have to put him on less amount because it was too much for his digest system. He was having diarrhea until i cut back on this to half and now he is all good and healthy. Both dogs appear to have more energy and i would definitely recommend this to anyone.
As per my review for the Nupro nutritional supplement, this stuff is great. I have no idea if it will help the dogs' joints or not but since I take glucosamine and chondroitin for my joints, I figure it is a good idea. My labs are pretty hard on their joints. They love to run and jump. I am hopeful that early supplementation will prolong their joints. This stuff makes my labs very happy! They love the taste and I do not find the smell to be objectionable. It smells like real food to me. I buy it monthly now and intend to continue.
We have been using this for less then a week and our 14 year old Pit Bull X is running around like a 9 year old!!! She had been starting to make ALLOT of cracking noises while stretching, especially in her neck and we noticed her slowing down.  Within 2 days the cracking sound is gone and she is able to go for family walks again and keep up with her 4 year old Catahoula brother.  Added bonus is that she LOVES the taste of the gravy that you get when you add water to the powder... I can't recommend this product enough and will be ordering the 20 lb once the 5 lb container is finished.
Our Koi do well on this food, so I ordered several 5 pound bags to get us through the summer. However, the actual bags have changed from last year. Whereas before they were easy to zip open and closed, and had a handle built in, now they do not have either of those features. In fact, the bag is practically impossible to seal between feedings. And it is very bulky and awkward to carry out to the pond now that there is no handle built in to the bag. I don't understand why the company would change these two features, it doesn't make any sense. I am going to have to find a suitable container now, to pour 5 pounds of fish food in to, that will have a handle and that I can close properly in between Koi feedings. Very disappointed.
Very solid food. Will probably last an entire summer in the size, and the bucket is rainproof. My fish seem to like it a lot and it doesn't cloud the water. I can't say it's "improved the color of the fish" as they claim, but I kind of find those claims dubious no matter who makes it so they can have a pass on that. Besides, I didn't exactly have a batch of control fish to measure against, so maybe it has.I'd recommend this food.
Once you get over the errr... provocative shape you'll find a heavy duty bone.  This is the ONLY bone I will leave in her crate. She is a super chewer and has whittled down the tip of this to a point but it has not broken off as any large pieces. This bone is the safest bone we own. We have had it for 6 weeks now and it's still going strong.  I actually just bought a second one to keep in the kitchen.  She has other nylabones (I only buy her the hard plastic ones and I always buy the biggest size available) but this is the only one I leave in her crate.
I have two medium-sized dogs who each have one of these.  The Souper size lasts them for many months as they are power chewers.  The smaller sizes only last a few weeks.  This is hard but not as hard as a real beef bone and is kinder to teeth and gums.  They also enjoy just carrying these around in their mouths, but I have to be careful I don't get one dropped on my bare foot!  These don't break off in litle pieces or slivers and are easy to clean if my dogs play with them in the dirt.  I will definitely buy these again.
I so want to buy nice squeaky toys for my two Bernese Mountain Dogs. But alas it is not to be. The male has been known to tear apart expensive, indestructible, for powerful chewers,you all the fun toys in minutes. Which leaves me nylabones or kongs. Both of them seem to prefer the Galileo to the other nylabone products. They chew after every meal and these tend to last about a year. There will be little white stuff on your carpets and also in their poop. The bones get sharp and are trip hazards but save the furniture and seem to be good for their teeth. My Berners give these two paws up !!
When our dog plays with this thing she throws it in the air and when it lands it sounds like she just threw a brick.  Minus the loud nature of this toy it is great, our dog is a powerful chewer and she can put bite marks into it but that's about all.  We have had this toy for about 5 months and it is still intact but with hundreds of bite marks in it.  I would strongly recommend NOT stepping on this.  Overall this is a durable toy that our dog loves.
Keep your toes out of the way - it's heavy and it's very hard.  We had a GSD years ago who loved his, now our current puppy has turned out to be a power chewer and I decided to try it.  She is medium sized at 35 lbs, so I dared to get the big one and she loves it! I know it will last a long time, but I did move it to the yard due to the noise factor of her dropping it on the had floor - fine with her, we keep quieter toys inside and this is a definite favorite of hers.***** I had to cave in and order her a smaller one, the souper size is a lot of fun for our dog, but the way she tosses it around it's downright dangerous sometimes. Stand back and let her at it.  So the smaller one turned out to be good, she loves it and I get to keep my toes.
Nylabone is just the best.  Our yellow lab has been working on this Galileo for well over two months.  Anything smaller for her chewing habits is gone in less than a week.  I highly recommend this for anyone who has a dog who gets bored just laying around and "wants to be doing something."  Best thing about these Nylabones are you can boil them in water to take away any smell that might come about with a little "age" if your dog likes to take their time with something this size.  The worse thing about this is that after constant chewing, you get the little "plastic spikes" that are created on the bone... and let me tell you what... this thing is NO FUN to step on in the dark when it has been chewed on-a-plenty!  Highly recommend!!!
I have tried numerous bones and chew toys without success. My 90 lb Lab/Pit mix is a heavy chewer who has destroyed just about everything I gave him. Even the heavy rubber Black Kong Extreme he was able to conquer. I ordered the Galileo Bone based on many positive reviews. Initially I thought the price was high, $14.00 bucks for a dog bone? This thing is huge and will outlast 10 cheaper ones. My dog loved it! It has a chicken flavor that made it irresistible. He chewed it for over an hour straight barely making a mark in it. This bone will last a long time and is worth the price.
Although I think the Nylabones are good if not the best bones to get for overactive chewers, I have not purchased this particular and peculiar, uh, 'bone' as I can't fathom a dog chewing on a 'toy' that resembles a penis. Besides, what will visitors think when there's a chewed up looking plastic, penis-resembling 'toy' laying on the floor?So. I ask the company, why??I think I will stick to the 'bone' shaped chews, my favorite being the giant dura-chews, which stand up to their name and last a really long time!  And my dog(Terrier-Sheepdog mix) is a power-chewer and may have a compulsive chewing disorder being a year and a half old! :)
I bought this excitedly thinking that we would have another option for our heavy chewer (lab/shepherd mix) to go along with the Nylabone Big Chews we buy. Our dog had inch-long gouges in this bone within 10 minutes, and was pulling off pieces larger than grains of rice in 15. This was not a good fit for our dog, and I'd highly recommend keeping a close eye to make sure they're not getting big pieces off when you first give it to your dog. You just never know. We still buy the Big Chews religiously.
I have a bloodhound/coonhound/black lab mix. He is a very aggressive chewer (he gnaws on stuff until it's gone) and I've always had problems finding toys he doesn't destroy.I ordered the Souper size, which was a good size for him. It held up longer than other bones I have ordered, but I had to throw it away after about an hour. The bone is very solid, but what he ended up doing was dragging his teeth on it, which created large chunks of sharp, hard plastic. He got a few pieces off of it before he cut his gums on it and yelped. After an unfruitful search for the missing pieces and some time cleaning the blood off the carpet, into the trash it went!Overall I'd say it's a nice product, just not the right one for very aggressive chewers.
I don't know what it is about the Galileo, but my American Bulldogs looooove it. They will actually fight over it. I don't know whether its the shape or flavor or what. I usually get them Nylabones dura chews (as they are strong chewers) and this holds up about as well (though it is hard to gauge as they really chew this one so much more). The biggest size is much larger than the second largest size, so despite the big price jump I still think its worth it.
I have two dogs who LOVE Nylabones. They have at least 30 Nylabones and they still get excited when they get a new one. This Galileo is my Chocolate Labrador's favorite toy. He is a dog who needs to be occupied otherwise he will eat anything in sight and this toy keeps him occupied for a long time. He has a very strong jaw and this Toy seems to be invincible. I would say that this is the perfect toy for a large dog who has a strong jaw. I would not recommend it for a dog who has small or fragile teeth because this is a very heavy and hard toy and I think potentially it could hurt the teeth of a smaller dog. Also, Keep in mind that since this toy is heavy it could potentially scratch your floor when your dog drops it out of its mouth. We have both Hardwood and Tile floors and I haven't had any issues yet but it does make quite a large bang when it hits the floor.
I have three large mixed breed dogs who are extremely powerful chewers and after much trial and error, I would never buy any other brand except Nylabone.  Nothing else lasts as long and occupies them as Nylabone does.  They always fight over this one in particular - perhaps they like it because it is much larger than all their other Nylabones.  This is definitely the largest one I have seen, so I would only recommend this for someone with a large dog.  I would recommend anything Nylabone if you want your dogs to chew a toy instead of your furniture!
I guess I'm in the minority.  I had heard that these were a problem and shrugged off the warning as one from the few malcontents having a bad day and bought this.  Good chewing BUT.....they made my dog sick and he barfed five times.  And guess what came up?  And, yes, the sharp little edges were still there.  No more nylabone products for me. I feel so strongly about the danger of these products that I am making the effort to go to every nylabone product on Amazon to post this warning.  mb
First Impression: Man it was time for a new Nylabone. Mom and Dad bought me my first two almost 5 months ago! They were looking a little nasty, but I still loved them. The kind folks over at Nylabone sent me a gift box and I got to try out this new monster of a chew bone. Now it is shaped a little weird, but I like it none the less. Every time Mom and Dad eat lunch or dinner I lay down and chew on a Nylabone. It keeps me entertained while they eat that amazing smelling human food... I just close my eyes and pretend.Conclusion: Great chew bone! Lasts a very long time. Not sure what could be improved.
My dog likes this okay but it's not his first choice. The Nylabone DuraChew Hollow Stick Bacon is his first choice followed by the Nylabone Big Chews for Big Dogs Turkey Leg. Because he prefers the others this hasn't shown much wear yet. It was also really stuck to the packaging when I got it which was a bit strange and made me wonder if it was old. Plus it's a bit odd looking laying on the floor--almost like something that could be in an IKEA &#34;Tidy Up&#34; commercial. Lol.
Our Bulldogs LOVE this toy and so do we. First the shape is a great design it's full of all sorts of curves and areas where your pooch can get a good hold and settle down to a long chew-fest. Easy to carry around even the goliath sized Souper presents no mobility problem for our 10 month old puppy.Our oldest a 95 pound 6 year old Old English Bull dog was practically weaned on this toy and he adores them. I can't even begin ti count how many we've been through which should give you a good idea of how much our dogs love these. The material isn't the newer extra tough Nylabone - but it's tough enough to hold up to Harley's massive jaw strength and relentless, no merct chewing fests.Like all Nylabones we discard them when the ends fray. This is one of their best toys and an all time favorite.
Bought this for my 2-year-old lab as she is a chewer.  She sniffed it and walked away.  I left it in her toy box and she picked it up once but only to move it out of the way to get at something else.  I don't think it has a smell that entices dogs to chew it as my 9-month-old, also a big chewer, hasn't touched it either.  I'm sure there are other dogs who love this but it was a waste of money for me.
Our lab carries around sticks, rocks, you name it wherever she goes. This particular style of Nylabone is exceptional because of the design.  There are two ridges that fit their incisors perfectly so they can carry it around without worrying it will slip out and break my foot if she drops it!~ Also, even though not flavored, she likes to work on it slowly, which means for the money it will last a long time.  We've spent a lot on the other types of designs and she liked them but they were either to destructible or too heavy for her to walk around with for any amount of time.  For whatever reason, it seems to calm her to carry a bone around and this is the best designed, tough and perfect size for a large dog. She says THANK YOU:)
I have two Rhodesian Ridgeback puppies (5mo & 10mo) and they LOVE the Galileo Bone in the "Souper" size. They grab it with their two front paws and will knaw on it for a half hour straight. It seems like it will last for a long time and the more they chew it, the more they enjoy it. It doesn't make a mess when they're chewing, the ends fray into something like tooth brush scrubbers, but don't break off.  I don't think the 5mo old would enjoy it as much if the 10mo old hadn't already started chewing it to create these scrubbers. It's probably best for dogs that have their adult teeth grown in. It would be too tough for the little one to knaw into a brand new one. I'm ordering a second one so they don't have to share it anymore! :)
My little boxer-pit bull mix has chewed through every "durable" toy there is.  I got her the "wolf" size Galileo and had to help her start it (it's slippery before they scratch it up) but now she loves it.  If you have a dog that can chew the other durable Nylabone products down to a nub then this is for you!  It doesn't even seem to matter that it's not flavored (at least not to my knowledge).  I would also recommend the Nylabone Double Action Chew - this one has also lasted far longer then the Nylabone durable regular bones.
This chew toy has lasted thru several strong German Shepherds.  The original lasted nearly 5 years.  No noticeable pieces of the toy seem to be laying around the house or in the dogs stools.  It really is a tough toy and although it's probably made in China (products that I detest), I've seen no adverse reactions to the dogs using it.  It is a bit heavy for the small German shepherd female that we have, our 125# boy plays with it like tossing popcorn.  I'll definitely purchase another when this one wears out!
We have an avid chewer (lab/boxer) and bought this thinking it might be a toy that actually lasts. Well it has but only because our dog won't chew it.  I was very surprised at how hard it was and was worried about our dog's teeth.  He was interested when we first gave it to him but now never touches it.  I think it's partially because of the heavy weight of it also.  We've had better luck so far with the KONG Extreme Goodie Bone. Our dog will chew this (we don't put treats in it, although you can).  I think he likes it because it's a softer material that he can sink his teeth into a bit. So far it has lasted.
Well, my dog cannot chew this to smithereens. So that's good. But it's HUGE and heavy. I have a 75lb pit-bloodhound mix that can't make a dent in it because it's like concrete. I think chew toys have to have just a little &#34;give&#34; to them to make the chewing satisfactory. This dog can shred KONG extremes and can't get his teeth into this. It's so heavy that he dropped it from his mouth once and it actually made a dent in our wood floor. Seriously. So he's kind of lost interest in it since he can't really do anything with it. I wish I had ordered a size smaller than the weight chart indicates.
In 1994 One of my heavy-chewing Samoyed dogs had a deadly episode with a Nylabone toy.  When I made the President of the Nylabone company aware of the problem with his product, he was extremely cooperative.  He not only undertook settling all the medical expenses but a couple of months later sent my dog a Galileo Souper with an attached note that read:  "Our team of engineers have come up with Galileo, the toughest dogbone around, created just for hard chewers like Rajah.  This is the first bone off the production belt for him.  I hope he is well now and will enjoy Galileo.""Silver Frost Rajah" has since passed away of old age, but his offsprings and currently his grand-puppies are enjoying it.  And, except for some teeth-scrapes, the Galileo is STILL intact !
I recently ordered three different Wellness Canned Cat Food varieties. I ordered the chicken, beef and chicken, and turkey. My cats LOVED all three and couldn't get enough of the food. I found the consistency to be perfect as well with the perfect amount of moisture or broth that my cats love. I did not have any problems with damaged cans that some users noted. I am ordering another case of all three flavors and I will keep this review updated if I come across this problem in future orders. Overall, highly recommended!
Still a work in progress, I've been trying to experiment with different brands and flavors of grain free cat food.  The Vet believes that there may be some obscure ingredient contained in some foods that makes my cat sometimes regurgitate the food quickly after she consumes it.  I've found that she can usually tolerate this one better than most.  However, the quest is still in progress, since she occasionally has issues with this one as well.Although she seems to like this flavor all right, I'm docking a star off the rating because it is sort of a pasty pate.  In addition, I've found it to have an obvious amount of whitish grease in it (especially when it is cold), requiring that I heat it briefly in the microwave--otherwise she will regurgitate it for sure.
We just adopted our two year old cat and have been testing out different wet and dry foods. I got Wellness Salmon and Wellness Beef and Chicken and the Beef and Chicken was the winner. We judged this based on the following: Cole ate the Beef and Chicken in about 20 seconds and licked the bowl clean. Hasn't happened with any other food! We also recommend the Wellness dry food. This cat food is expensive though compared to others but if I don't eat crappy processed food why expect my cat to?
What, you say? A finicky cat? How unusual! Right. But as they are finicky, it also means that what one cat likes or dislikes may be entirely subjective and not true for another cat. Damn animals! Gotta love 'em. Anyway, as I said, it is a high quality food, and not as expensive as the ones my cats will eat, of course. (Especially in the big cans.) It is not grain-free, though. And remember that fish types are cheaper to make, but aren't so healthy for your cat. This is also the pate form, which, of course, my cats don't seem to care for. They like the gravy stuff, thank you very much. So you might want to try this. But I suggest going to a store and just buying a few cans, and some different flavors, for the picky little things to try first. Definitely not a whole case, like you-know-who did.
We purchased this dental Kong version as an alternative to our dog's regular Kong toy.  We stuff either this or one of the other Kong's for him each day and give it to him when we leave for work.  The large size is perfect for our 60 lb. American bulldog/lab mix.  He will get it to play with and chew at other times of the day.  So far, after two months, it hasn't worn out or fallen apart.  He seems to enjoy it just as much as his regular Kongs.  It favorably compares to other Kong products and it's a good value for the price.
We have had a regular, large size red Kong for months. It's still going strong. We put a medium size Milk Bone in it and he loves it.He's now fully grown at 70 lbs and I figured I'd upgrade to a bigger size and get some teeth cleaning done at the same time.NOT an upgrade!Short version. I put a large Milk Bone in it. I'm in the room with him and I look over and see him with his head up proudly looking at me chewing, but the Kong is on the floor. I figure he got the bone out of it already, but there is no crunching. Turns out he's eating a piece of the Kong and there are other pieces missing that he must have already swallowed. I don't know how dangerous that could be but it seems pretty bad. What if I had left him alone with it.The story ends...... Ten minutes from Amazon package to garbage can.
We have a one year old shepherd, boxer, pitt mix and he liked this toy a lot.  But then we left him alone with it one day (as we often do with his Kong toys) and he ripped it to shreds.  I didn't know that was possible with Kong Toys.  We'll stick to black Kong toys from now on. The good news, my husband put the bulbous end of using a saw and now we use it as a somewhat durable ball for play in the backyard.  So we still got some use out of it, just not its intended use.
Costco's Kirkland Dog Biscuits fit perfectly (tight enough to stay in) in this toy, and isn't easy for my pup to get it out.  She's a labrador.  She works it for a while before she starts slamming it to the ground, thus breaking the biscuit up and allowing small pieces to come out at a time.  I can see it working even better with a smaller dog maybe, although it is quite a large Kong toy.  My dog doesn't have separation anxiety when I leave for work anymore, because she knows she's going to get her Kong with a treat inside every time I leave.
Our 11 month old male English bull terrier loves this toy, and our female of the same breed loves to play with the toy and chase with the toy.  The toy is very rugged, yet soft enough to interest them.  So far neither of them have chewed any pieces off of this toy.  We have used the tougher black rubber Kong bell shaped toys also.  These red rubber ones are a bit softer and easier for them to play with if you can keep them from destroying the red rubber toys.  So far so good with ours.
I tried this product after using Arm & Hammer, Tidy Cats, and at least one other brand. My cat is not picky about his food or litter and has never missed his litter box. I slowly integrated this litter with Arm & Hammer Litter and it wasn't until it was nearly completely World's Best Cat Litter that he decided to take a dump less than two inches away from his designated area.This has never happened before but luckily that was the only incident. Looking over it, I still can't find many reasons to continue purchasing this brand. It tracks EVERYWHERE. I have a black table nearby my cat's litter box and it looks like someone dropped corn flour every time my cat exits his designated area. The odor control is mediocre at best.I do not recommend this litter nor will I be repurchasing this brand.
I've given this product a good run of 4-5 months of use. My cats thought it was strange at first, but they used it. My biggest complaint is that it only stays fresh smelling for 3-4 days. A few days after changing out all of the litter it begins to take on a damp, sickly sweet corn smell--not a cat pee smell, but yucky nevertheless. I clean the 2 litter boxes twice a day (two cats in the house), and the pee clumps are fairly hard but tend to crumble more easily each day as the litter loses freshness. In other words, you really need to change out the litter every two weeks, which gets expensive. If you go longer than two weeks, the litter just smells offensive. I'm returning to cat crystals.
WARNING !!!!!  they don't even make there own food it is licensed out to another company if you look on the back of the bag it doesn't even list who it is made by it only says guaranteed by canidae and when i asked who it was made by i was1 either completely ignored2 given a huge run around only thing i ever got was a state it was made in they wouldn't even tell me the companythis is dangerous because this is how all the pet food recalls happened a few years ago by out sourcing manufacturing
the price and size were right to donate to humane society. My cats have refused to switch to purina or whiskas from Blue buffalo. I was seeking to reduce costs but just knew when I saw the big bag that there was no way my cats would eat it.  I had thought it was fancy feast...white cat...gourmet...so when I realized its just a cheaper brand than even the purina ....well. As a donation though it helps Im sure.. The dogs will eat it if the cats wont..at my place the racoons get whatever the cats reject.
I have a crazy-mad chewer at home, and an occasional chewer too. Upon arrival, I quickly unwrapped the toy and looked at it. It is covered in little bumps that look very easy to chew off, so I was a little skeptical on how this would hold up, but I like it because it cleans their teeth. I gave it to the occasional chewer, and she sniffed it before slowly grabbing it, chewed a little while, and left it alone. She hasn't chewed on it much since. The crazy-mad chewer likes it, but not as much as the other bone. He was chewing it one night and from the sound I thought it would be gone in the morning, but no, it is still holding up pretty well. A few of the bumps have come off, and some are stretched, but overall it is doing well for my dogs...and protecting things I don't want them to chew on.
My dog was so very sick and as I was about to take him to the ER, he vomited several pieces of this chew bone. I will add a photo. This could have been a disaster requiring surgery, or causing death.  PLEASE, don't buy this. My dog loved it but I should have listened to the other negative reviews. Please don't learn the hard way like I did.  He's only 13 lbs.PS I have since learned that rawhide treats are no good either, the rawhide sits in their stomach taking weeks to digest. The butcher dept in my grocery store sells bone marrow bones. I think it's the cow's femur. I boil it for 15 mins and dogs love it  It will keep him busy for hours.Update:  I've since learned from comments below that dogs have broken their teeth on these bone marrow bones. Luckily my dog seems to be over the chewing phase .
My dog really likes the Nylabone (Blue) Dental Chew. I've never experienced a problem with her use of it in all the years I've been getting it for her. The nubs on the surface of this chew toy massage the gums and the salivation promoted by it helps clean the teeth.As with all dog chew toys, you should periodically check to see how your dog is doing with it. Any chew toy fragment swallowed (no matter what type of chew it may be) can suddenly become stuck in the throat or intestinal tract.(I did not give it 5 stars because it's not made from a natural material.)However, I am very disappointed in the price tag from Amazon:  as of this review, the regular size (4-1/2") is sold for $5.49, but you can get it through Drs. Foster & Smith Pet Supplies for $2.99 -- I discovered this AFTER I'd placed my Amazon order. Amazon and its merchants know they can sell it for less and should be competitive with their prices.
I bought one of these at PetsMart, and my puppy loved it, so bought another one on Amazon.  They're good, but don't last too long; maybe a week, more or less.  Puppy has lots of toys, but when he FOCUSES on this one, it gets worn down rather quickly.  It's not too expensive, though, but I've also taken to freezing a wet washcloth for him to gnaw on.  Great soaked in broth or stuffed with kibble then frozen for 20 minutes.
This is the only "hard" synthetic chewy my dog is really interested in. It is slightly pliable rubbery material - but he's had others with a similar feel that he wouldn't chew as long as this. Not sure if it's the nubby texture? I bought this size hoping he could hold in his paws, but it's still a little short (he's a 20 pound dog). We end up holding one end while he chews - with his eyes closed and an expression of pure joy. He works pretty hard at it for 10 minutes or so.
I spent several decades slinging around large bags of as many as three age-specific formulations at a time, depending on the makeup of my family. I can't do that anymore and I was happy to find the &#34;all life stages&#34; formulation, guess we've come full circle from when I was young and all dogs of whatever age ate the same thing. Anyway, the bottom line was would they eat it. Resounding yes! Rip, the old boy, bolted his down (one of the reasons I like small nuggets) and then was snacking out of the bag until I closed it, at which point he lay down right by the bag. That was a couple of bags ago and they continue to eat it happily. No digestive difficulties that I'm aware of and I do keep up with stuff like that.
My dogs skin has improved a lot since I switched her to this food. I'm dissappointed in the amount of grains used in it and tomato pomace. Protien amounts are great. For only a few dollars more I can get a grain free salmon dog food made in the usa not by one of these huge dog food companies that tend to have recalls all the time. If your on a strict budget this is a great food for dogs, but I want better for mine so I'm switching to Taste of the Wild dog food.
On June 15 I adopted a 2yr old jack-a-poo which was rescue from a puppy mill. Every time he ate he would make strange sounds. He would also throw up a lot. The foster mom had him eating wellness brand. I had him for 2 months and really had no idea what to do.I switch him over to Purina Pro Plan Sensitive skin and Stomach just to see if that would help. I am surprise at  the result. It is like having a new dog. He no long makes sounds or throw up. If he drinks water to fast he coughs but, other then that this food has fixed his issues.I highly recommend this if your dog has issues eating they may just need a different diet.
This product has better ingredients at a better price than some lesser quality foods. I'm still debating making my own dog food. They suggest not giving dogs table food, but cheaper dog food typically costs $1/pound. I have a difficult time purchasing food for my family that's $1/pound (we eat A LOT of chicken for that reason). Chicken is currently $0.49/pound. Homemade dog food is looking very cost effective these days. Either way, apples to apples, this is a reasonable purchase. It doesn't cause my dog flatulence like some other brands.
Been using this for awhile now. I have three dogs. A husky, a husky mix and a Rottweiler. They love this food for one. Amazon ships it in a big box to keep it safe. It is very healthy compared to most dog foods. It is pretty cheap and it fills them up! I only have to buy one bag a month because it is so filling. They are healthier and stronger looking. Their fur is shinier than ever. They have muscles I never seen before. They are lean and more energetic. Their teeth have become more white and less stinky breath even! I will never stop buying this for them! Good dogs deserve the best food! This is it. Their is nothing I dislike about this food! NOTHING.
I found this to be the best bargain for a higher quality dog food, comparable to Wellness and Blue Buffalo. My dogs both love it and one of my dogs that often gets topical yeast infections does not have problems on this food so its not full of bread filler. The only other food comparable for my dog's yeast problem is Wellness and it got too pricy for me.  I did notice a salmonella recall on the Diamond lamb flavor, spring of 2012, so I keep an alert on my google news,  but its the only recall I've seen and it went public fast, right on the Diamond site and there were no fatalities because it was dealt with well.  Still, good to know.
Hey if my dog loves this thing that means is good! I know, you'd be like all dogs love food, but mine is different. He eats mostly meat, and this is just like something to be over there. I usually give him a coup and a half, and will last him 1 1/2 day. He is very picky when it come to dog food, and this was the first time when he actually eat that just like that. I have an old school pitbull, 67-68 pounds average.
You would not believe all the trouble I went through with my dog and so called dog foods.  I even tried some of the really expensive stuff and I would still have to spend a fortune (again) on wet food for her to even eat it.  So I came across this and after reading many many reviews I took the plunge.  OMG!!!!  for the first time ever my dog eats this food (on a regular basis) by it's self.  I am now almost done with my first bag and will be buying another two.  This dog food even smells good,  and for any dog that is a huge deal.  I will not hesitate to tell my friends about this brand.
My dogs love this food, it is great as it has ingredients that I can understand and know what they are: and no biproducts! It has one of the higher ratings among the dog food lists. I have been letting my two dobies use this for this reason. It lists no biproducts and Beef meal and barley and rice are the first three ingredients. I have to say it is great dog food for the price, as we are on extreme budgeting in this household; and with Amazon, it qualifies for free shipping, which makes it even more appealing! Thanks, Patti Roth
Purchased Diamond Beef Meal and Rice - dogs loved it at first....  I mixed it in with their old food and all was well for awhile, then I noticed that after about a week they stopped eating it all together.  Even when I left it in to bowl and didn't give them their old food for a short period, they wouldn't eat it.  I noticed vomit on the floor and saw my dogs both start to drink LOTS of water.  Bad sign - giving up on this stuff.  Read about their problems with recalls - bad choice to buy this product!!!
We were using Diamond Lamb and Rice for Puppies, but all of a sudden our dog had diarrhea that just wasn't clearing up. The vet did every test in the book, and they were all fine. So we changed his food, thinking maybe the lamb just wasn't doing it for him, and chose this Beef Meal and Rice Formula. His stomach issues cleared right up, but now he only eats his food once a day, when he used to inhale it twice. I think he doesn't like the new flavor. He'll inhaled it when his Natural Balance wet food is mixed in, though!
I didn't get what picture and ingredients showed.  So I went to Pet store to rebuy My dog's treats.  They didn't have duck potato lg size without hickory smoke either.the pet store was told the packaging would change. Picture very deceiving and Hickory Smoke flavor was NOT included in description nor size change.  So Yes I was and am kind of disapointed.  I may buy them again. I don't knowthank you Peggy W.Actually they turned out to be good. My new little chihuahua mix pup loves them and my sweet Jeffery who has passed away loved them.  review from 2 stars to 5 stars.
My dog loves them. I've stopped ordering them from Amazon though because my local pet store sells them for four-ninety nine and has an ongoing deal where if you buy three bags, you get the 4th free.. Check out your local pet store for better prices.These are great quality, safe treats. My dog eats the dry, limited ingredient diet food for small breeds. He's a pug with allergies and has never had a problem with these treats or the kibble.I recommend trying these with your pet. Get them from your local pet store for a much better price.
My male cat has a lot of allergies.  I've tried using many products to boost his immune system and add luster to his coat.  I also happen to show dogs and use the Nupro Gold on my show line of animals with great results so I decided to try cat nuggets.  WONDERFUL.  At first my male cat wasn't to keen on eating it, the female gobbled it down.  After a few days he ate it fine.  I just sprinkle a 1/2 teaspoon on their individual breakfast.  You can also mash it up into can food.  Male cat no longer has the runs, coat looks amazing, and no allergy issues taking this supplement.  (He's allergic to grain and certain cat litters).  Female cat also looks amazing but she never had much of an issue looking fab!
This product is great for about 1-2 years. Over time, the motor will get bits and pieces of your pets' fur and food, which causes the motor to break down, even with regular cleaning. I found no way to purchase a replacement motor, so I was really bummed (as were my cats!).I ended up purchasing a new fountain, but upgraded to theDrinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain. I highly recommend that fountain because it has a small guard that blocks food, fur, and other particles from getting into the motor and its' reservoir.
I've wanted to buy one of these fountains for my kitties for years.Last week it was one of the Deals on Amazon, so I splurged and bought a $25 gift for my kitties!They love it. I like having it there, it makes barely any noise, just a light trickle. The kitties love it, drink from it and play with the water stream.It's got a nice long cord, though I need an extension to put it where I want it. I like the on/off switch on the cord, and the water filter. It came with extra filters, at least a year's supply. Great value.
I gave this to my mother for Christmas. She has an old cat who loves to play in water and she had always talked about some day getting him a pet water fountain. I had read a few other reviews and was a little leery as to how well this would work, but gave it a try.Her cat loves it! From day 1 there have been no problems with it. And best of all, it VERY quiet. You can't hear it at all! She has it set up in her living room. I didn't even know it was there.I would just make sure you always have it filled with water so the pump doesn't burn out on you. Because cats drink so much water with this, when you first get it, you should watch the water levels so that you get an idea on how often you should replenish the water supply.Absolutely great product!
I have four dogs. This fountain, even the jumbo size, couldn't keep up with them. The pump died in less than a year, despite regular cleansing of the unit about every two week.Cleansing this unit is NOT a snap, and the pump intake clogs with dog drool/hair/debris.You have to dissamble the whole contraption to really cleanse it well. the ENTIRE inside/interior gets coated with slime if you don't.So, tonight I'm purchasing another fountain. My dog has been diagnosed with chronic kidney failure, and the vet has said make sure he drinks a LOT of water.So, I'm back to the drawing board.One thing though, our dogs did LOVE to drink from this. I just wish it could have stood the pressure of all four of them using it. For the record, I have a labrador and three beagles. It wasn't as if I expected it to stand up to four Newfoundlands!
I recieved this fountain in the mail approximately 2 weeks, ago, so I will enter a new review later if my opinion changes...That said, this is a great fountain so far.  Fairly easy to assemble, extremely quiet (almost silent), and very easy to refill...you can leave it running, remove the water container, refill and replace without having to turn the unit off.That said, it is not the petmate "deluxe" model..no in-line power switch, no flow adjustment valve... so, don't buy this if you are looking for those features.Only time will tell if the pump continues to work as silently and as quietly as it has so far, but as of now, this is a good purchase for the money...given the mistake in labeling it as "deluxe".  It is still at least $10.00 cheaper than the same model at my local pet chain store.
It does what it's supposed to, but it's LOUD! The motor itself isn't bad, but it vibrates. So by itself, the motor is quiet, but once you mount it in the tank the vibration makes the whole thing loud as heck. I haven't figured out any way to stop it from being so noisy. Wrap the motor in bubble wrap, maybe.I had the original Petmate Deluxe, until the motor finally just quit after a few years, and it was great. This one, not so much. Quality has sunk. There is no more on/off switch on the power line. The disconnect is at the plug adapter instead of near the tank itself, making it difficult to unplug and lift out when it's time for deep cleaning. There's no flow adjustment, and the flow is rather slow.I'm pretty disappointed with it and am considering returning it.
My cat loves her fountain !!  She really likes to drink right from the little hole at the top where the water comes out.  The only complaint I have about this item is the frequent cleaning.  I guess cats just naturally get saliva in their water, and this fountain will need to be cleaned about weekly, otherwise, your cat isn't getting that nice, fresh water you were thinking about when you bought it.  I take the fountain outside and give it a good wash with a little soap and bleach, (and of course a good rinse) and it's good to go.  Sometimes I put ice cubes in the bowl, which the cat really likes. Be sure to check the little grille over the pump intake for cat hair.I've had this for over a year and it's still working fine.
I've had my Fresh Flow for a few years now and the unit works well. In fact, I purchased one for my mother's pets. I'm giving this fountain two stars because within the last year, the company has changed their filter replacements to this cheap piece of garbage that has barely any charcoal in it and slimes up quick. The new filters cost the same but now you have to replace them more often. I would think a cheaper product deserved a cheaper price, especially if you have to replace them more often. Check out the filters here on Amazon, you'll see I'm not the only one dissatisfied. Because of this, I am switching over to the Drinkwell system. I've checked out their filter system and it looks a bit more substantial.
I've had this unit for over a year and while I like it better than a plain bowl of water, there are some flaws.The blue reservoir is growing algae in the corners and because of its shape, it's impossible to clean those spots. I also have hard water in my apartment, so the slide gets a lot of hardwater build up which doesn't come off with scrubbing. Finally, the thing is always getting clogged up with cat hair and weekly cleanings are necessary if you don't want your cat drinking gross hairy water.I will likely purchase the type of fountain that comes down like a faucet whenever this one breaks but I won't buy this one again.
This Petmate medium size water fountain has turned out to be a very good item compared to the last Petmate medium one that I had bought several years ago.  This has a slightly more powerful water pump compared to my last one.  The water filters with the fountain is the only thing that slows the water flow down too much after a few days of running.  Their filters are quite thick in substance for the water to flow through.  I have found that the small Whisper brand of water filters for the fish tanks work real well with this water fountain versus using Petmates filters.
Purchased this Petmate Deluxe Fresh Flow a couple of weeks ago. It makes a soft running water noise, pleasant to hear. My cat immediately started drinking from it, as she loves running water. Keeps water fresh and clean for her. easy to reload - just unhook the cord from the plug and take to sink. Makes a loud noise when there is debris in it (bugs, food, whatever) to let you know it must be cleaned out! so much easier than refilling the water dish all the time...
My cats love this.  The moving water actually helps cool it off which my cats prefer.  Since buying it 8 months ago, both of my cats have ceased drinking from the toilet bowl after I flush it (they love that cool, moving water).  Yes, it accumlates fur, but as long as you clean it thoroughly once a week (takes 5-10 minutes), everything is fine.  The motor is incredibly quiet if you have the item assembled properly .  After taking it apart and putting it back together, sometimes you have to do it again if it is noisy.  Not a big deal since THE CATS LOVE IT!The only complaint I have is that the charcoal filter is AFTER the motor... so it doesn't filter out any fur or other gunk from the motor.... which is why you have to disassemble the motor (VERY easy) in your cleaning process once a week.
We bought this for our cat a couple weeks ago and it has been great. I really wasn't too sure of what to expect, but figured we'd give it a shot. It's less than $30 so why not right? It was slightly confusing putting everything where it belonged because the directions in the box are for the one you're getting as well as their deluxe kit, which you are to skip over. After it was all done and running, our cat couldn't wait to check it out! Right away he was drinking the water and sometimes at night I catch him trying to play/fish in it! It really doesn't make much noise at all. The sound of the water stream is actually pretty soothing. If it makes any noise then you need to fill up the water reservoir. I have no problems with this and I love the fact that it's filtering his water. We all love it!
I purchased this Jumbo drinking fountain to make sure my cats would drink more water.  More water they drink the less I have to worry about with urinary infections.  All my cats love this fountain.  Some drink at the bottom tray and others will drink from the top where the water is just coming out.It keeps the water cool all the time.  My only problem is when my 2 Labs come into the house and when they drink they will devour the whole thing and I have to watch to make sure that the water does not get below motor.So far I have had this fountain for about 6 months and it is very quiet, easy to install and easy to clean.Julie
I have 2 Dachshunds and a cat and this fountain is perfect. Purchased a different fountain and it stopped working after a few days. This fountain got great reviews, that's the reason why I got it and I'm very pleased with it. My pets have no trouble drinking out of it and they have fresh water all of the time. I do empty the water out and wash the bowl twice a week to get out the junk that the dogs' leave from drinking, which I would do with any bowl. Other than that, I'm sold!
It's great to have flowing water for cats.  My cats love running water from the faucet.  The water in this fountain is not running, though, but flows down a slope, so it's difficult for the cats to even see the water running.  My cats didn't drink from the part where the water was running.  I later bought a different flowing water pet fountain that runs more like a faucet, but we no longer use that one either because it is plastic and our vet recommended that cats should only eat and drink out of glass bowls, not plastic.  Apparently the plastic containers can cause irritations.  One of my cats had a swollen lip and the vet suspected the plastic water dish as the culprit.  Too bad no one has made a glass flowing water fountain!
I've found that almost all cats strongly prefer to drink running water as opposed to still water. Cat eyes are attracted to motion. My cats drink much more often from a fountain than a water dish which makes me feel better about their health. Cats love this thing, the only cons are from the human maintenance side of things.Cons: A water fountain is more work than filling up a dish. You must plug it in, turn it on, clean the pump, replace the filter, and refill the resevoir often. This does get annoying but is not a problem unqiue to this fountain, and to me it's definitely worth it for my cats.The fountain is pleasant looking, a perfect size, and very quiet.
I had purchased the Petmate Deluxe model of the 50-ounce Pet Fountain for my cats. That works exactly as described and my cats drink more than they did from bowls of water around the house. I like blue, and the basic model seemed as if it would perform the same as the deluxe model. My cats still drink from this model, but it doesn't fit together as well as the deluxe model and, as a result, it often leaks, leaving puddles around it. If I purchase another, I will only get the Deluxe model.
I've had two of these fountains, and several family members also have them.  Yes, weird things happen, and at least one was returned to company with pump problems.  For whatever reason, they do not include the following information routinely in their packaging.  For a pdf that illustrates routine cleaning, and some FAQ's, go to: [...]  You need to take the pump apart and despite the instructions in pdf, use the pointed type q-tips, a wire cake tester, in-between-teeth cleaner brush(really), you get the idea, to clean it inside and out! My cats love this fountain, but we joke that one of them has a "drinking problem," because she likes to belly-up at front of fountain and drink from waterfall, resulting in a drenched bib.  The pdf should address many of the common complaints about this product.  Good luck!
I bought a bubbler water thing for my cats for the bedroom, but the bubbler was way too noisy so I long ago ditched the bubbling parts.  I've been wanting to get a fountain in there, but wanted something quiet.  I thought this Petmate fountain would be quiet since the water doesn't drop far from the spout and I was right.  The only sound I hear on the level it's on now is a low hum from the motor that is no bother at all.  The cats are used to the Drinkwell fountain in the livingroom.  It took them just a few minutes to check out the Petmate and now they seem to drink out of it more than the silent bubbler thing.  My only wish is that I'd have bought the large or jumbo size for a bigger dish and reservoir.  With 5 cats I have to fill the little reservoir bottle up every night.
I thought this would be the perfect solution for my sink drinkers.  They do like to drink out of this fountain.  The best feature of this is the quiet motor, you can hardly hear it when more than a few feet away.  the problem is that the motor starts to grind as soon as the water level goes down, which in our house is every day.  So i find myself filling it all the time.  You also have to have filters on hand.  And it gets grimy quickly.  I have several animals, so maybe if you have only one or two, it would not be as much of an issue.  all in all, not a bad product, but could use a little improvement.
I bought this for my older cats last year and they had no interest in it so I stopped using it.  They are gone now and I have a new set of cats.  They are fine with it and like how the water flows around.  The item has worked fine for me but I do have to put water in it every morning.  Easy to do, I just pour a paper cup full into the bowl.  If I don't it makes a lot of noise, quiet when full.  Still I like it and don't worry about it very much.  Clean it about every month and that is fine.
I've been using Petmate water fountains for a few years now, tending to get a couple of years of use out of them.  For the price, the amount of use (two cats) and hair I'm usually cleaning out of the pump, it seems reasonable to me.  I bought the latest one recently and was pleased to see they've included a screen in front of the pump that is catching a lot of the hair before it gets to the pump.This has a nice water flow, is usually quiet (unless there's a clog or water is pouring out of the resevoir) and the cats have no problem drinking from it.  Those are its pros, along with its price (much better than the version that the vet pushes).  However, I've noticed that this unit is more difficult to put back together after taking it apart for cleaning, which cost it a star (not sure if it'll get easier over time but am certainly hoping so).
My cat thinks this fountain is fantastic, which is what really matters.  I'm sure she'd give it five stars, but she's not the one who has to clean it.  There are a few areas that are hard to reach with a sponge, so I bought a baby bottle cleaner which does help in reaching some of the places I just can't fit my hand.  The mineral deposits get pretty gross on the ramp the water flows down, so you do need to scrub the fountain fairly frequently.  Overall, it's a good product that's designed so the cat can't tip it over.  I do wish I'd bought a larger size (I have the medium) because I have to refill it often.  As it starts to need water, it makes a loud swishing noise that turns into a horrific sucking sound when it gets really low.
I was concerned from other reviews that it might be too noisy-after the pump fills and starts the waterfall, it is very quiet, almost inaudible. All of my cats love drinking out of it. I clean it weekly, which admittedly isn't as easy as cleaning a plain water bowl, but I think it's worth the extra 10 minutes. It's funny as now they wait for me to put the fountain back vs. drinking out of a plain bowl. I use the filtered water from my refrigerator and the charcoal filters that came w/ it. The customer service from Entirely [...] was wonderful and this item arrived in a few days. I now shop directly at their web store since they carry CNET dental cat chews that really clean their teeth-Greenies get gobbled too quickly w/o any dental effect.
We have one of these and one Drinkwell, and the kitties seem equally happy with either one. The Petmate is a bit quieter, but is even more difficult to clean, which needs to be done more often than I'd like. Neither one is a day at the beach to clean, but the Petmate has even more little nooks and crannies and narrow little spots that are almost impossible to get the gunk out of. And as soon as you're done and fill it with fresh water, it starts getting icky again before you know it. Since there's no obvious useful purpose for all the little hard to reach spots, I can only conclude that whoever designed these things likes cats OK, but hates their owners.
- "Problems, Problems, Problems All Day Long" Like the old Everly Brothers song, this product has been nothing but ongoing problems. The little tank in the back never drains properly, the fountain doesn't run well for more than a day without some kind of an assist, the little screen that's supposed to catch debris before it's pulled into the filtration system is a nightmare to remove and reinstall......and so it goes on and on.  TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY! I should have sent it back, but I'm usually very handy with gadgets of all kinds, and just kept believing I could make this 'lemon' work well. I was wrong this time. DON'T BUY THIS ONE... GET SOMETHING IN CERAMIC OR STAINLESS STEEL INSTEAD, FROM ANOTHER COMPANY !!! PETMATE SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THIS INFERIOR PRODUCT!
I have always used the Pet Mate water fountains for my pets.  When one of their last ones wore out, I bought one of these AspenPet Cool Flow Pet Fountains.  It wasn't near as quiet as the Pet Mate ones I was was used to.  I put a thick plush throw rug under it and that helped a lot.  It does have a powerful filter system on it.  To reduce the sound, I changed the filter to a filter that is a slight bit thinner and that did help too.
The first two days this fountain worked great. Both my cat and I were very happy with it. On day 3 the pump started making strange noises. I checked the troubleshooting and pulled it apart to make sure the pump was not what was rattling. (It wasn't) Also the unit seemed to be leaking water out of the middle where it is attached. Right now... the pump is out and my cat is once again having to deal with standing water only. So much for this solving that problem.I bought another one of these and the problems with the first one were gone. I must have gotten a lemon the first time. The pump on the new one is quiet. Now if my cat wasn't so suspicious of the flowing water, my life would be easier. I updated my rating from 2 stars to 5 stars.
I had this for less than three days. The first day it was great.  I wish it gurgled more for the cat but it was fine.  The last day I noticed that it seemed to be going through water quickly for one cat.  Then I noticed the throw rug was saturated.  Then i noticed the discoloration of the hardwood floors.  Then i noticed the wet spot in the basement.  I checked to see if the water container was screwed on correctly.  Then i placed it on a dry towel on the kitchen counter.  Within an hour the towel was saturated.  Luckily I bought it at Walmart.  Back it went but instead of putting it aside so that some other poor peeson would not be sold this piece of crap.  They put it aside to be reshelved.  I wish I could give this 0 stars.If this fails on you it could do major damage before you discover it.
I have two cats, one was a little scared at first, but the other one took right to it and will even lay beside it on occassion when it is hot.  Now they both love it, when I first set it up, it did make a sound, but after a week when I went to clean it, I realized that is makes that sound if it is not completely full.  Now the loud sound that others complain about is gone, you have to make sure that not just the reserve part of the fountain is full but also the main container level matches water level as well. Cleaning it once a week is best, since fur can get caught as well as food bits in the main fountain.  But it is a really good fountain, it was so good that I got one for my moms new kitten!
Clearly when you get these if you have ever purchased a small, medium, large or xl cat box you will soon find this would be small for a tiny kitten. It is more a tub to keep pens and art supplies in than a simple and functional litter box. I checked the measurements prior to purchase with another of my boxes but when it arrived, it was no where near a cat box size. Having said that, if it had been a usable simple litter box and not a storage tub without a lid, then I suppose it would have been okay. Nothing special. No frills. Just a box. Maybe for emergency travel or one-off situations where nothing else is available, but you would be better off in that situation to use a box flat and a kitty liner. Sadly I missed the return date by one day (I will call Amazon tomorrow to discuss) due to illness so now I may be stuck with two unusable boxes.
This is in no way a Giant cat litter pan, lol. I ordered it based on the description that it was larger than large-that it was giant. I have a cat on the larger side and thought this would be bigger than the large pans found in pet stores.It's not.I ordered a large cat litter pan from amazon for $5.99 that is larger than this one.The pan is of nice quality though. I think it would be perfect for a medium sized kitty.I'll be returning this. False advertising is a pet peeve.
My female kitty had an UTI and the vet ordered her the VET-only supplied UTI food at a very high price. She didn't eat it at all, neither the dry nor the wet kind.So I bought some of this Pro Plan UT Focus formula. She eats it - not exactly with great pleasure - but she eats it and since weeks we had no more problems. As mentioned by many other customers, the &#34;cheaper&#34; food is as good as the one that the vet tries to sell with a big profit. I recommend it anytime.
I purchased the Purina Pro Plan Sensitive Skin and Stomach Formula as two of my five cats have very dry skin above the tail.  I knew they needed extra omega vitamins as I've been feeding them the Hiarball Conrol Formula.  This is made with lamb as the first ingredient.  I don't think I've ever seen the five of them eat dry food up so quickly!  It seems that I'm always refilling their bowls.  The dry skin seems to be better after 2-3 weeks of eating this formula.  One of the cats still is some flaking, but it is much better.  Perhaps it takes awhile to completely go away.I received this very quickly as always.
Same product as Purina One, different bag. I even had the kibbles to compare side by side and they look identical (shape, size, color, smell). Our cat would not eat the Purina One so we got him this one. He won't touch it either.Ingredients list is almost identical, I think they swapped a 2 ingredients' places in the line, to make it look different when really they are about the same amount and the same formula.Rip off! If your cat loves this, get Purina One, you'll save about half the cost!
PLEASE read the first few main ingredients before buying the product. Do not look at how fancy the wordings look but look at the actual ingredients that your cats will eat. Most of these food contain-1 - Chicken By-Product Meal -- "dry, ground, rendered clean parts of the chicken carcass."2 - Whole Grain Corn -- grains = high carbs = fat.3 - Animal Fat (preserved with Mixed Tocopherols and Citric Acid) -- a tocopherol is pretty much a form of vitamin E.4 - Corn Gluten Meal -- that's a protein corn by-product; it's a little deficient in lysine, so it shouldn't be the only protein source, which it isn't. (Yes, your pet can digest it just fine).5 - Brewers Rice -- another by-product, leftovers from the milling process.Please consider Grain-fee food for your cat if you want it to live a longer life because grain-free obviously doesn't contain grains, leftover meats, and the price is almost the same as these cheap 'craps'.
Due to work, I had cats in South Africa for two months before they were transported to Venezuela.  I was afraid they wouldn't like the new food or get sick, since I didn't have the food they were used to previously.Both cats took to the food quickly and really enjoy it.  No tummy issues, but I do always recommend that if you are switching food, do so by adding a little more of the ProPlan and less of their previous food during a week's time.I am happy becuase I know they are eating healthy.  As a treat, I also give them wet food once a day.  Dry food is there all day.
I dont care what the vet said he/she also say nothing of the side affect when giving your pet shots and whenever you ask a question it should take 3 minutes to answer but they are busy and only say a few seconds worth UTI's arent cause by a food but ingredient cats NEED water but not water from a bowl cats in the wild get water from meats they eat so they dont drink much causing stress on organs especially on the bladder a kidneys so I feed cut up raw chicken breast very small every 2 days and also feed wet every other day and you MUST have a grain free food to fully stop organ and body problems such as infections pains joints anything even shedding yes shedding is controlled by food so get a good food you can afford yet your cat can live and not survive on vet only get a few hours of nutrition classes provided by Science Diet so dont ask them about brands go research and look even Newman owns is good so id evolve to name a few local store brands
One of my cats was having issues with UTIs. After numerous vet visits due to recurring UTIs I decided to give Purina Pro Plan Urinary Tract Health a try since my cat refused to eat the prescription food the vet recommended. To my surprise, she didn't have any issues eating this brand (she's quite a picky eater) and it cured her UTI. This was about a year ago and she hasn't had another UTI since! Although it's dry food, it's not dry like typically brands. It's more moist which is what you want to help with UTIs. It doesn't seem to have any effect on my other cat who doesn't have any issues with UTIs which means that I don't have to try to feed them different food.
My 13-year-old Persian thinks this stuff is pretty good.  He has that disease, Lymphocytic-Plasmacytic Gingivitis Stomatitis, which means he had to have all of his teeth removed since they attack his body, but doesn't have any trouble getting these down.  He usually eats mostly wet food but he enjoys this dry food quite a bit.  Plus, he doesn't toss up his lunch anymore since buying these which, in my opinion, is the best part.  The price is fair here on amazon too - it's higher in the local stores here in Ohio.  Recommend!
I have a 2 year old male tabby and a 6 year old female tuxedo cat. Both of them are slightly overweight so I started feeding them this dry cat food a year ago. 4 month ago my male cat developed urinary track blockage (crystal) so we have to keep him on canned food diet. We couldn't be sure the exact cause of the blockage (food, stress, genetic...) My female cat would not eat canned food so we let her keep eating Pro Plan's Weight Management dry food.Now my female cat got urinary track  blockage as well!  I am kicking myself have been keeping her on this dry food.Do not feed your cat this food. Urinary track blockage is very costly to treat. Once they get it, it could be a life long battle. Be carful!
I  fed this food during the hottest days of summer, as it has a lot of moisture to it. I prefer to feed dry food, but every other or every third day I have been feeding Felidae. During the hottest weeks one can was all I needed for four cats. A fourth of a can filled them up at once, though sometimes they came back a couple hours later and finished the portion. I feed under, and to the side of the air conditioner to keep the food fresher during the hottest days.Then they also have a pan of dry food in the bedroom, and another in the kitchen.I feel very confident with Felidae because of it being made in the United States.I have rinsed out the can and poured some of the water in with the food. Big mistake, they won't eat it. They won't eat it with anything mixed in it, i.e. pieces of cooked chicken.Straight from the can they seem to really like both flavors I have been buying.
This food has the weirdest texture I have ever come across. Out of 3 cats only 2 will eat it. Hemmey the fat boy wouldn't even try it. He walked away instantly. I have to use a different spoon as he won't touch anything  that has come in contact w/ it. It reminds me of potted meat & the texture is disgusting. For $1.87 a can I will look elsewhere , but I have to buy the 13oz cans when feeding 3 cats. Not to many choices w/ free shipping. Guess I will have to feed them canned food that isn't grain free.
I rated this product as I did because it may have a little dust but not near as much as others I have used... The price is right on this product being it is delivered in 2 days to my door... I choose the 14 lb box as my litter box is upstairs and it's a pain to haul the bigger boxes up the steps... One other thing I find the smaller box good for is storing the used litter until I fill the box.... I can then carry the used litter downstairs to dispose.... I wash the litter box a couple times a month and 14 lbs fill it nicely... My cats are not picky about scented or unscented and I have used both with good results...
After receiving the product in the mail, I read the package that this bone is made of nylon and contrary to description, it is NOT edible.I left my 20 pound dog chew on it and after a few hours it was already scrapped and used-up. I usually leave her playing with the bone for an hour or so, and she began to feel really sick in the morning.Last night I let her play with the bone for a couple of hours during dinner, and this morning she threw up and was very sick. This bone made my dog sick, so it's going in the garbage and getting a bad review.
I got this in the mail today, sent using Amazon prime. It got here in less than 48 hours so that aspect was great.I purchased this for my dog after my friend's dog stayed for the weekend and my dog ended up loving his smaller version of this chew toy (she shredded the ends of it). So far my dog really likes this. She is a 35lb terrier/beagle/pit bull mutt who can destroy one of the medium sized nyla bones in a month, so I thought I'd give it a try. I will amend the review if I have any problems later, but so far it's great :)After about an hour of chewing today, she already did shred one end of it a bit (more than she is able to do in an hour on a new nyla bone) but I'm sure it will provide her plenty of use before it's destroyed. 5/5 so far
My pets love their snuggle mate.  I bought mine about 7 years ago and it is still going strong.  My cats love to snuggle with it.  I am now looking to purchase one for our dog's crate (for in the car).  For the people who have had problems with theirs...you really must be more careful with the wattage your microwave puts out. If not, it appears that people have warped theirs, started fires and other problems.  One must really use products safely in order for them to be safe for their home and pets.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who needs a safe pet warmer without wires and that is virtually chew proof.  We will find out if it is actually chew proof once our 6 month old puppy gets one for Christmas :-)
I got this for a baby prairie dog to keep him warm while he was in his cage. I ended up just getting a pouch and holding him most of the day since he refused to sleep on this. That isnt due to this being a bad product though. It holds heat nicely without being too hot and the fleece is very soft and really keeps it so its warm instead of being HOT. I would highly recommend it for any animal in need of some warmth! Also it does stay heated for 12 hours like it claims.
We have a family of feral strays that we care for. We bought Snuggle Safe to tuck into their outside bedding to keep them warm during freezes this past winter.I was skeptical.Following directions, then placing the heated disk underneath their blankets in their &#34;cat house&#34;, I was AMAZED to find that, 15 hours later, heat was still generating from it.We used this disk all winter and it still works great. The heat will last much longer if you make sure to wrap it in a towel or keep it insulated in some way, so that it emits a low heat all night through.
I've had this for years, and it still works as well as it did the first time I used it. There's not many products one can say that about! Simple to use (just microwave it for a few minutes) and the heat output lasts for several hours outdoors; about 12 or more hours indoors.One of my cats is arthritic, and this really helps her joints, especially in the colder months. While it does take more effort to prep than a plug-in cat bed, I feel that is more than offset by the fact that you're not tied to an outlet (can locate it anywhere) plus I don't have to worry about shorts or other electrical problems.I've even used it myself a few times when I've had sore muscles and needed some heat therapy.Highly recommend!
I have used one of these for years and bought this one recently.  The quality is the same.  I am the caretaker for a spayed/neutered & vaccinated small feral cat colony.  I heat these in the microwave one at a time before I take the cats' water and warmed food out to them.  The water goes on top of one disc and the food atop the other.  In this cold weather, minus 10 to 20 degrees, these discs keep the food and water from freezing for about an hour, long enough for the cats to get there and eat and drink.
First of all, make sure you know the wattage of your microwave oven. Ours is old and so we are guessing on how long to heat this. We bought the SnuggleSafe Microwave Heatpad to use with the Kitty Tube. However, this product does NOT fit through the Kitty Tube door, therefore the top of the Kitty Tube must be removed to put the SnuggleSafe inside. This not only allows cold air to rush into the Kitty Tube but also totally freaks feral cats out and often they will not return to use the Kitty Tube for days, if ever. Unfortunately, we do not have an outside outlet to use the electric heating pad that can be used instead of the SnuggleSafe so we must rely solely on straw for kitty warmth.
I bought this heating pad for my miniature dachshund who is always cold and loves to burrow under blankets.  After heating the pad up for 6 minutes (it comes with a sheet that tells you how long to heat depending on your microwave) the pad stayed quite warm for at least 8 hours.  My dog will snuggle up to it if I cover it up with blankets but by itself (even with the fleece cover it comes with) it is still pretty hard and apparently unappealing to her.  I do wish the pad was a little softer so she would like it more but at least it is sturdy enough that she can't chew it up.  The pad does come with its own fleece cover so don't bother buying another one unless you want extra or if they make something thicker and softer to put it inside.  If your dog or cat is not picky about what they snuggle up to this is a great item to keep their bed or kennel warm.
My aunt suggested this product when I mentioned that I was thinking of getting a heated pet bed.  Fortunately my cat Guy took to this right away. He's an older boy, recently adopted from the Humane Society.  He gets the shivers when he lays on our cold floors.  It takes him forever to stop shivering, even when I hold him under a blanket.  He can be nervous though--I just bought him a cushy pet bed that he refuses to lay on.  So I was worried he wouldn't like the disk, but honestly, it's bringing him more bliss than catnip!  Another thing to note is that it does come with a cover--I wasn't sure that it did since the photo didn't show one.
I love this and my Sphynx cats do too, but the big drawback is that it feels like a rock and doesn't soften up. The cats would like it better if it were soft.  Follow the instructions carefully-I was concerned that my Sphynx might get burned so I put an extra cover on it.  Saying that, I want to emphasize that the warmer does not come out of the microwave hot-it comes out nice and warm and is able somehow to maintain that warmth for maybe 10 hours.
I have been very happy with my Snuggle Safe heat pad. The claims of 10-12 hours of heat are true IF you insulate it a bit. OK, it cools off in 4 hours or so if you leave it sitting out, but under a blanket, it stays toasty for a good 10 hours (I don't think I have every checked it after 12 hours, but I expect it would still be a bit warm).Granted, my cats are not much interested (maybe they will be when the weather gets cold again), but I love it. I stick it at the foot of the bed (under the covers, so it stays warm), or even just hold it while I am reading in the evening.  I also got one for my Mom, who has Reynaud's Syndrome, and she says it is great. She just keeps it nearby and warms her hands as needed.
My dog LOVES heat so I thought this would be perfect to put in her cage while we are at work. I buried it underneath the blankets, and had the blue cover over it. She ripped off the blue cover and chewed all the way around the warmer, and punctured it so I can't use it at all.Now I'm stuck with the blue cover, paw print cover, and dog stuffed animal.The warmer is a lot harder than I thought it was, so I can see how some dogs wouldn't find it very comfortable to lay on, but if you use the stuffed animal the heat doesn't go through it very well.The one good thing is I was surprised at how long it stayed warm.
I bought the first one and the cat liked it. Do not over microwave, it will melt. The trick to having it last 8 hours is the pets bed.I am using this for a mini doxie, 5.5 lbs, I bought her a tunnel bed, and she wears a light sweater, with the snuggle in her bed she is not waking me up to put it inthe microwave at 3 am.Mini dogs have to be kept warm, they die fast. I micro this and put in her car crate when we travel around town.
I bought this for a feral cat I am taming.  She is in a room that gets a bit chilly at night.  It stays warm most of the night.  There have been times when I come back in the morning that it is cold, but also times that it is still warm.  The only thing that would make it completely perfect is if it were more flat and maybe softer.  I put blankets around and over it to make it a little more comfortable.  This is a great product!
I have owned three of these for about 5 years. They warm nicely in the microwave but do not stay warm all night long! No way do they stay warm 12 hours. More like 6 hours. The price has skyrocketed since I purchased my first one a few years ago. I am pretty sure the first one was only $9.99. I think the second one was $19.99. They are way over priced. I find they do not heat up well after only 6 minutes of heating Nd as I mentioned, I have three of them an d not one of them stays warm for 12 hours. Maybe a larger one needs to be created for a multiple cat use but still heating issues would be a problem.
THIS PRODUCT REALLY DOES WHAT IT SAYS!  I bought this for my Airedale's crate at night.  I thought it would be nice to radiate a little heat  (during these chilly winter months)  under her top towel, and on top of her cushion and blanket.  SHE LOVES IT, and has a hard time getting out of bed in the morning!!!  This disc is very hard, but she doesn't seem to mind (and I put it under a thick towel).  It actually stays warm for about 8-10 hours,  and I microwave only 5 mins and 15 secs, which is slightly under the recommended time for my microwave.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
I am really liking this product after all.  I was not sure it would stay warm for long, but it really does.  I have not determined how long yet, but hours more than anything I have ever used.  I put it outside under a blanket in a small house to keep a cat warm, and I think tonight was the first she was on it!  Even if the cat does not like it in the end (I had an electric warmer before and she was afraid and would not go in the house) I am keeping it to warm my bed before I get under the covers!
My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do.
Multiple times I have heated the SnuggleSafe according to the directions, and the pad never gets hot enough to generate enough heat to penetrate the fleece cover.  It doesn't radiate heat the way I had hoped it would.  I'm afraid to overheat the pad in the microwave (as the instructions caution against), and I worry the pad will be too hot for my pet if I remove the pad from the cover.  I should have thought better about buying the SnuggleSafe anyway - from the pictures it's obviously very hard and probably not comfortable to lie on.  (If you pad it more, then the heat will never get through to your pet.)  My cat has no interest in it.
I bought 2 of these for my cats for Christmas. They are great and the cats just love them.  It did not take them long to figure out that the disks are warm and they snuggled right up to them.  My cats are indoor cats but I figure on the coldest days it is always nice to get some extra warmth.  I also had to get one out before Christmas because I had a sick cat that needed to go to the vet.  I fits perfect in the carrier and I did not need to worry that my sick cat was going to get chilled.  I love the fact that there are no cords and the cover that comes with it is great also to keep a barrier between the cat and the disk. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to give their pet some extra warmth without cords.  The disk stays warm for a good 12 hours so you only need to microwave it twice a day.  Great idea and gread product!
I thought it'd be a nice heating pad for my dog when it got cold because there were no wires. He sleeps on the landing of the stairs outside of my bedroom.  This is a  hard plastic disc and I heated it up for my dog, hid it under his blankets. He has a nice area where he sleeps at night. I was super excited for him. Went to shower and came out to check on him and my little 17 pound beagle carried the heating pad up the stairs and dropped it off in front of my door and was back in his bed curled up. I got the hint, he didn't want it.
This product does what it says it will do but you have to be careful about overheating. I put it in a microwave for about nine minutes and it warped the bottom which weakened it, and in another two heatings it leaked. Rather expensive Frisbee at this point.It does hold heat very well and the large flattish shape is comfortable for pets but I am not replacing it. I got some quart plastic kefir bottles that are heavier than most milk bottles and fill them with hot water and heat. They do almost as good a job and are free when I'm done with the beverage. Not suggesting you don't buy this product but the instructions made it sound like you had to heat it three times longer than recommended before there was a problem. I was nowhere near that long and it failed.
All of my cats love this food, and the 12 and a half ounce can is perfect for my 4 kitties. Something about this flavor attracts my dogs, and I need to keep them away from it. Which a can of Wellness dog food usually does the trick. Wellness brand is by far the best in regard to both dry and wet food, and I've tried them all. Though more expensive than some other brands, the litter boxes are cleaner and less smelly. This product goes a long way, so in the end the cost justifies itself immediately. We are all Very Happy with this product.
My kittens love this food and they certainly seem to be growing at healthy rate. My adult male cat doesn't really eat it but he's always preferred dry food so I buy this for the younger ones and their mother.  Mom and the litter were abandoned so I'm not sure what she was fed before but she seems to really like the food and its put some much needed weight on her. They seem to really like this flavor and the beef and chicken. Both are a bit smellier and oiler then the others but that's probably what they like.
What a great cat food. The ingredients list speaks for itself. My cat developed IBD, and couldn't eat dry food anymore without vomiting. Some brands of wet food were fine, some were not, and the ones that were (like Fancy Feast) didn't seem very nutritious. I switched her to Wellness, and she hasn't vomited in over three months. Although it's more expensive than dry food, it's not that much more expensive than most wet foods, when you buy it here from Amazon in bulk. My cat loves it (but she loves everything), she's been very healthy, and it's saved me tons of money in medical expenses.
My cat is very peculiar about food. He does not like a lot of flavors, but this one is a winner! When I look for cat food, my main concern is the quality. Looking at the first ingredient is great, but reading through the rest of them might seem to be overwhelming, but I do that as well. Wellness presents as an outstanding product. I recently found out that cheap cat food brands like IAMS etc. use food flavoring and additives to make the food smell better than natural products, so it took my cat a few tries before he was convinced of the quality of this product :)
We feed one can of this per day to our three cats. They really enjoy the food and always come running when we are getting the can out of the cabinet.We chose this particular food because it's one of the cheapest grain-free wet foods that we can get that still maintains a quality product. We have one diabetic cat and do not want the other two progressing that direction, so we switched over to grain-free to help control blood sugar.We've been using this brand for several years now and have never gotten a bad bag of dry food or an expired lot of wet food. Would highly recommend to those watching what their cats are eating!
I switched from Advantix II to this b/c the ticks around here are bad in the summer but in the end, none of them worked. What I have been using and it has worked since is Pet Naturals spray which is a mix of natural products and you simply spray the dog before a walk and it prevents the ticks from attaching to the dog in the first place and that has worked and I have been using it for years. The plus side is it is all Natural and not a chemical like Frontline or K9 Advantix which is a big plus. Also a little drop of apple cider or vinegar on their treat is another natural repellant and great for their immune system. During peak seasons of ticks when it is warm ill drop some on their treats once every week and even that little amount helps.
I used to use this to protect my large German shepherd mix up until the day he passed away at 15.5 years old.  He never had any issues with fleas while on this product.I recently adopted two small dogs, about 20 pounds each.  I use one packet to treat both of them.  I bought some 1 cc syringes and some dispensing needles and just split the content of one pack evenly between my two dogs.  Saves me a lot of money AND they get a proper dosage of the medicine.
I love Frontline Plus for my cats, but it gets expensive. And then when I moved to a new neighborhood I found a few stray cats too. Before finding them new homes, I had to use flea control meds and it definitely got expensive.  I'm so glad this was created.  I just hope that something like this can be created for the oral medication for Program too.  I have some feral cats I can't touch and mixing Program in with their food is the only thing I can do, and that gets pricey too.  I'm very blessed I make good money, but still...
This is a great product--it does work very well. My vets assistant told me if I buy Frontline from Amazon I am NOT getting a legit product as it is only sold to vets. While it is true it is only sold to vets..it is NOT true that the vets office is the ONLY place you can get a legit product.I emailed Merial and they confirmed I did indeed buy a legit product from Amazon. Go to the Merial web site--email them, as I did and they will give you a phone number to call so you can verify whether or not you have a legit product.I am not saying don't be careful...please do..but I buy Frontline Plus from Amazon..it works and it is legit.
Ok, so I have a Scottish Terrier that has severe flea allergy and we have used frontlineplus for almost 4 years with no problems, and not one flea.The past few months that I have used this recent order from amazon.com she got fleas at the end of themonth.  I am assuming either I got a bad batch, or it didn't work the full month.Either way, I am scared to use frontline plus for her anymore.  She got huge sores, whelps, hairloss and it cost me 150.00 in vet bills as well as more money buying other prevention and differentshampoos for her.
I typically purchase flea products from my vet and normally get Frontline for the dogs.  For whatever reason this didn't seem to work as well.  It appears to be the same product but for the first time in years we ended up with fleas.  I went to the vet about 30 days after I noticed the first flea (and after realizing we were starting to have a real problem) and purchased Frontline from them and applied it to the dogs.  After just 2 weeks I've noticed - no more fleas.  I do not know if the infestation was a direct result of buying this product online but I wont take the chance again.
Shipping was fast, got it within a week with Free Super Saving Shipping.  Says that it stops all stages of fleas, and kills and protects against chewing lice and ticks as well - I'm not sure about the chewing lice and ticks, but I did find fleas on my Lab puppy when I got him.  I use this on him, and within two weeks I didn't find any on him at all, not even after I bathe him and used a flea comb on him.  Says it works up to a month, and is water-proof.I'd highly recommend.
I have been using Frontline plus on my dog for all of his 6 years of life and he has NEVER had a single flea or tick on him. He attends doggy daycare where they have had flea outbreaks in the past but he has never been effected. Based on this history of the product working well and preventing any flea issues I feel it is definitely worth it to continue to use this product every month. I have also compared the benefits of this product with other flea and tick products and this seems to be the best you can get. The health of and well being of my dog is just as important as my own so I will continue to use this product as it has been successful for my dogs whole life and I have confidence that the product truly works.
'Frontline' is considered the best and most effective flea & tick control product on the marketplace.  Sure, you will see other brands that cost much less than 'Frontline', but you get what you pay for.  I've been told by my vet and pet store managers, on several occasions, that most of the other products out there have been known to cause more siezures and deaths in dogs, as compared to the safer and more effective and proven 'Frontline' product.  My dog had flea issues, and was scratching endlessly for days.  Just a few hours after I applied this product (simple 1 spot application between dog's shoulder blades on back), my dog stopped scratching, and is resting happily.  'Frontline' worked in no time!
I was not sure if I should order online or just go to the vet. The reviews on amazon were the reason I was more willing to go and just buy it. However, I decided to order them because I knew for what to watch out, and I was aware on how to check if the product is fake by reading the reviews. The Frontline came last Tuesday, and it just happens that it has come a day before I have to apply the formula to the dog. I am happy with the product; I don&#8217;t see any fleas on my dog. I have been buying this product for a year and a half now, so far I have to say that I am really happy with this product.  I will update this post if I see any changes. I am a bit concerned that they might have had change the formula, since a lot of people mention it.
We have used Frontline on our dog her entire life (she just turned 5) and it works great.  We spend a lot of time outdoors with her so our primary concern is ticks.  This past weekend we were up in North Dakota with her and my Dad and his dog - my dad's dog had on another tick control product and we found over a dozen ticks on him each night but our dog never had more than 2.  I think the ticks would have died and fallen off if we hadn't found them first.
At first it seemed to be working.  It seemed to get rid of the fleas.  None to be found after a few days. Whoo Hoo!  But then after the first 10 days, they were back.  I thought the eggs must have hatched that were in the house and they too will be gone after they bite the dog... nope.  The fleas seem to be worse now than before.  (not that frontline made them WORSE) But the effectiveness seemed to wear off after about 10 days!  That is a huge cost for just a few days coverage.  :(  I groom, raise dogs and do rescue work.... It cost a small fortune to get frontline for everyone and now seems like it was a waste.  I have doses for one more round... hope it does better this time.
This summer and into the fall, my dogs went through a tick infestation.  I tried several different products, and this one worked the best.  I have 3 small dogs and I actually purchase the largest size tube and use a syringe to measure their dosage, which I found on another web site.  If you use these flea and tick products, you know how expensive it is.So, it works very well killing fleas and ticks and if you find out what your dog's dosage is, you can purchase larger tubes and save a bunch of money.
I would give it 5 stars if it wasn't an oily topical that you have to avoid touching for 2 days until fully absorbed.  I know the flea protection works and can only hope that the tick protection works, too.  I like that it's supposed to repel ticks and lice.There is a new one out called NEXGARD that is oral, but I'm reluctant to try it since it currently only lists one tick type and isn't a repellant, so the tick has to bite the dog before it kills it.
This liquid prevents the full development of fleas and repels ticks. It works well to keep my large dog flea free; unless of course we go some where with adult fleas that jump onto my dog.I have not found ticks on my dog; but I have got them on myself numerous times walking on the trails with my dog on leash.I have not found fleas on my dog after using this product consistently. It is great to see my dog not scratching from fleas.I tried many other liquids and powders; but this one and "Advantage" are the two that have worked well for my dog with thick fur.
I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping, packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO, no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose.
Historically, my family has had great success with frontline. I don't want to discourage anyone from trying it because I know it can work (based on the flea population characteristics your dog comes in contact with).We had been using this for 2 months when my dog went to a friends house while we were on vacation. When we got back, he had fleas galore. We put on the next frontline a week early and it did not even phase the fleas on him.We switched to K9 advantix II and the fleas were gone within a couple of days. I know that some fleas are now resistant to Frontline, and that certainly seemed to be the case for the fleas on my dog. I would recommend not buying any more than a 3 month supply at a time in case your dog gets fleas like mine that aren't phased by frontline. If you try Frontline and it doesn't work, k9 advantix II might, as it did for me.
Our dog is an American Eskimo and we live in Miami, Florida. We have exterminated the yard, his bedding and had been using the Preventic Collar.  We also used Rose Geranium oil, all with no success of the tick infestation on our dog.We finally tried Frontline Plus and it has been a couple of weeks now and we are still having the same tick problem.  Adult ticks and baby ticks.  It's not doing a thing to help get rid of the tick problem so far.There are no fleas at all and plenty of ticks on the dog every day.
This fipronil medicine is a breakthrough in pet care.  I researched the medical articles thoroughly to make sure it's safe for my dogs.  The research shows that this is one of the safest medicines on the market.  The fleas are COMPLETELY GONE!  I have never seen a single flea or tick on my dogs after using this product.  The review from the other person about sluggishness in their dog is jumping to conclusions based on a coincidence.  There is nothing in the medical research to indicate that would be a side effect.  There are no side effects other than temporary reddish skin at the site of application and even that was in a rare number of cases (skin can get irritated from just about anything).  The bottom line is that the fleas hate this product, and I love this product!
Not knowing any better, I treated my 20 lb. rescue, mixed breed with Frontline Plus for several years. I would stop treatment in the cold, winter months thinking I'd give his system a break. Upon resumption of treatment, my little guy had a seizure -- eyes rolled back, involuntary shaking and tremors -- lasting about 30 seconds to a minute. The second time it happened it dawned on me that it must be a reaction to either Frontline or heartworm treatment. I stopped applying Frontline and there have been no seizures that I'm aware of -- and I'm with the dog 24-7. The Frontline was purchased from the vet and I reported the problem to him. He said he'd had other reports of the product causing problems or simply not working. I would advise anyone to Google flea prevention and read about what we're administering to our pets. There are safe alternatives. We don't need to poison our pets for our convenience.
Frontline Plus is the only product I've used until present when we started using a multi-purpose Heart worm topical that includes some tic and flea protection.  Seems one still needs Frontline type protection anyway..Consider getting a syringe and small container (available on web) and splitting larger does Frontline over two or more applications.  I'd not be comfortable using one so large that it took more than two or three months to use it all - and keep the unused portion in a cool/dark place I have been told.
I rescued a cute little dog. Well, after a few days, I found that she had ticks.  I have never had a dog with ticks before so I did not know what to do. I probably did not have problems before as my dogs always had Frontline to keep them flea free. I bought this and immediately started the applications. It took a few weeks but now I rarely find any on her and when I do, most of the time they are dead or almost dead. I feel the product does what it is suppose to do.
Check out the FAQ's on the Frontline website.  Here are a couple of quick tips I've learned that have helped.-Your pet should not be bathed or swim for 24 hours after Frontline is applied.  If it is applied after a bath, be sure your pet is thorougly dry.-The longer you use it the more effective it is, single applications are not nearly as effective.-You can still have a flea problem even after treatment due to the life cycle of a flea and timing of the treatment.  Best thing to do is to continue treatment in the meantime.-Also, you may see increased flea activity after applying Frontline.-Frontline is definitely beneficial for tickborne illnesses.  The tick needs to be attached for 36 hours before the pet can be infected, 36 hours is typically how long it takes for a tick to die after attaching to a pet treated by Frontline.
Frontline worked fine for a while.  But fleas are like viruses.  If everyone in an area uses the same flea treatment then the fleas learn to tolerate it.  This summer a lot of folks around here started complaining the Frontline no longer worked for them.  Unfortunately, it was true of my dog as well.  She is riddled with fleas within the first week after treatment.  If this happens to you I recommend using a cheap Nitenpyram pill.  You can get them on Amazon.  One pill will kill pretty much every flea on your dog, but it only lasts a day. But it will give you time to find another treatment that will work before you house gets overrun.  Lets hope you never get the Super Fleas!
I have used this for years without a problem, but I believe that they have changed the formula, because it quit working a few months ago when I bought my new batch.  My vet said that they have gotten a lot of similar complaints, and that long time users have switched to other products.  I am now using Advantix which works great, and also is supposed to repel mosquitoes, but there have been some cases where Advantix causes a skin reaction in some dogs, so you might want to try a single dose before buying an entire package.I wonder if these mail order purchases are old stock from before a possible formula change.
Normally, I love Frontline Plus for my dog. However, I chose to order this from Amazon because the price was cheaper. This frontline did not work at all. Something was wrong with it. I order alot of "thinks" from Amazon and never had trouble before. I have had dogs all of my life, used frontline plus ever since it came out, and it always worked. I ended up buying Frontline Plus from another reliable place and it works "great" just like it always did. This was a bad batch.
I sent this product back because it was a KNOCKOFF!  Very subtle, but my vet confirmed it, and we've been going to her for over 5 years so I know she's telling the truth!  I ended up going to 1800PetMeds because they guarantee their products are authentic.  I buy products on Amazon all the time, but for something as important as my dog, there will be no more bargain hunting on Amazon for something like this.  Spend the extra $ to get the authentic product.  Amazon is great for a lot of things, but should put a LOT more focus on protecting its customers!!  Counterfeit products from China, and other Asian countries can be VERY dangerous and if you love your pet like I do--paying more is far cheaper than a vet bill!  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!
We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well, and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine, not a single flea.  However, come late spring, the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas, but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas, we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty, but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season, which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though, maybe that's just what happened.
I have purchased this for 4 years for my Scottie Ebony.  I had always obtained them from the Vet.  They work so well and he has never had a single flea or tick that I ever found.  He is more of a house dog but goes outside to his spot to do his business.  But he loved to roll in the grass in our large backyard.  He has never had a case of heartworms and I also give him HeartGard medicine to prevent worms in his heart.  I always have to buy the larger size for him because the smaller size does not have enough to cover him and protect him.
We adopted a stray dog that prefers to be an outside dog.  Living in a rural area, she has free roam of several acres of land and was constantly scratching at fleas.  I had tried products from our Local Feed and Seed but they didn't keep her flee free.  Frontline Plus has been a miracle.  Not only does it keep her from scratching from fleas, it kills the flea cycle.  Fleas still get on her but they don't live long enough to cause a problem.  Amazon's price was considerable LESS than what I would have paid at the Vet's office....PLUS I used my Amazon Chase card and took advantage of my collected 'points' which brought the price down to almost NOTHING.
My dogs have been having seizures on an almost regular monthly basis since they were 4 months old (they are littermates). I only started recently searching about the relationship between Frontline and seizures, and there are SO MANY people whose pets have had seizures from Frontline. Your vet will deny it but there are too many people who have reported it. Sure enough, I realized my dogs were having seizures 1-2 days after each application of the preventative.This product may work well on some dogs, but for mine, the evidence is clear and the Frontline has been causing seizures in my dogs.I'm switching to a gentler, natural brand.
OK, I hate to leave negative feedback, but Frontline just doesn't work. It only works for 7-10 days, and the fleas start coming.I've had my dog for only 6 months, and I started using Frontline Plus right away. As soon as the weather started getting warmer, I started dealing with flea problems. I thought maybe the Frontline I got off of eBay had gone bad or was fraud. I bought some on Amazon, and it was the same. It only works for 10 days max, then the fleas start coming back. Now I got fleas in my apartment and have to deal with chemicals to get rid of them.I took my dog to the vet yesterday and she said a lot of customers are saying the same thing to her, and recommended I change the treatment to another brand.Stay away until they get their act together.
I'm suspicious of the packaging because I've never seen it, and it does not match the picture shown.  The package I received has a different dog on it, and the UPC has been replaced with a sticker with a different UPC on it.  I am returning this because it does not match the packaging at my vet, nor at other pet websites that sell Frontline Plus, approved in the U.S.Update: Surprisingly, Amazon will not allow a return on this item because it's considered hazardous. So with that thought in mind, buyer beware.
We've been giving our dog this medicine for years and its always done a good job of keeping the ticks and other things off of him.  We have found a few dead ticks in his fur, but never a live one and certainly not one head deep into his blood supply.  Applying it isn't so difficult but since our dog is white, it does leave a discoloration in his fur until his next bath.  This is what our vet recommended so we're going with it and it works fine.
I am very pleased with the this product. 3 MONTH Frontline PLUS Orange for Dogs 0-22 lbs I have used it on two dogs and neither ever had one problem with this.  No reactions and best of all, never a flea.  It was recommended to me by my vet and I am pleased with it.  Also note, that if you have cats, there are certain products that you should not use on your dogs since they can be fatal to a cat living in the same household.  This is something not everyone knows, so please check with your vet if you have a mixed household of pets.
I have always used frontline plus on my many dogs but this year, my pom got sick when I used it on her, she couldnt get enough to drink and was panting alot I mean alot she layed around and didnt want to go out with me to walk or even in the yard, and the front of her chest area was ringing wet  from her panting not from the water not satisfied with this product anymore and I've heard of more people complaining that frontline is not the same as it used to be,, I am not using it on my pom because I don't want her sickagain..
This has 6 applications, where you use this on your dog once every month for 6 months during the summer months.  It helps to kills fleas and ticks that might get on your dog.  No dog should be left outside all day in the summer, because there is a bigger chance of your dog to get fleas and ticks.  Take them for walks, and let them out with you, but don't keep them out in the yard all day.  They need water, and air conditioning is nice!!!!
I've used Frontline on my dogs (and cats) for years now.  I had once gotten a country dog and no matter what I did, couldn't get rid of the fleas.  Then Frontline came out and I was finally able to get rid of them.I've used this product for at least 10yrs and have never had a problem.  This year was the exception in that we had a warmer than normal winter and a very hot dry summer, so I did have to use some flea spray as well.  but it is under control.ONe other thing.... I was told by the vet that it works best if used all year long.  Might be a tad pricey for that if you have several dogs (and cats) like I do, but if it'll stop the problem before it begins, it'll be worth it.Thank you.MEF
...this year, after using this product since 1986, I have actually seen fleas on my dogs.  I had heard through the grapevines from other vets and people that the item just is not doing its job.  I don't know if its because our NY winter "never freezing," like it usually does, however, I would have to say I have to start looking for a new product.  I am not sure if this is either a quality control issue with the company, all I know is that I've used this product for way over 16 years, without incident.  I don't like K9 Advantiix not for the lack of product control, I just found that my dogs actually get ill when its applied, and lasts at least for 2-3 days.  Not sure what is going on with Frontline, but I'm not happy with Merial ... they need to look into this a little bit more.
I used it for a few years but alas, probably because the fleas acquire resistance, it no longer works. I've switched to Advantix and it does. Of course, I'm concerned, societally, that as with antibiotics, it's an endless battle. I hope we keep developing effective (and safe!) flea controls and antibiotics, but it's hard to remain optimistic that we always will. Of course, the world may well have ended before then--for example, some terrorist scientist creating a highly communicable mutated smallpox virus that he released in a public place.
I have tried both products and for me this one seems to work the best. It keeps fleas away and ticks. I also use this with the Vibrac Preventic Tick collars. Before I started using this and the Preventic Collar, I was always finding ticks on my dogs. 5 and 6 at a time and they would be totally engorged by then. Now, I may find one or 2 baby ones on them, but get them before they can really bite the dogs, because something in this product repels them, so I really am a believer in this. I totally have seen the difference and can't live without it. I stock up on it because it runs out of stock often.
ok first of all seller changes his seller name all the time, so beware of that. do not rely on looking for the name of a BAD seller to do more shopping!  2nd. they advertise this product as FRONTLINE PLUS!  BUT WHEN YOU CLICK THEIR AD, the product is FRONTLINE TOP SPOT!....not the same , and it is the reason it is cheap. look it up...frontline top spot does NOT kill flea larvae or eggs, so you only kill the adults. not good and a waste of money!**** HONESTLY IT IS A big GAMBLE TO BYE FRONTLINE ANYMORE HERE. hard to catch the scammer!
I have used Frontline for years, and in the last 4 or 5,it is different.  It doens't work as well as it once did, and I lost a cat because of it.  She had symptoms of poison.  The vet suggested it might be antifreeze.  I live in the country with no home nearby, and how many actually put antifreeze in their own vehicles nowadays?  My dog had a seizure and it took reading this discussion to figure out it was Frontline all along, poisoning my pets!!  I thought my dog just old, but in retrospect, each time I put it on him he reacted quickly with the seizures and throwing up.  Thanks to everyone posting on Amazon discussions about the dangers of Frontline! I don't want to put even one star on this rating but it makes me before it will post..
I had stopped using Frontline a few years ago when it 'appeared' to stop being effective on my dogs. It was on sale a couple months ago so I tried it again. I don't what they did but I'd say it improved as I found no sign of ticks (or fleas) on the pets. We are heavy with them here in Maine in the fall and so far the Frontline is doing what it suppose to. As long as it does that and doesn't have an adverse effect (which can happen) on our pets we'll continue to use it..
I have a stray cat who comes in to the bathroom off my garage every night.  I got him used to doing this because I was afraid of all the predators in my area.  He is perfectly happy there, and I sleep better knowing that he is safe.  I have been giving him frontline every month, and every night when he comes in I pick ticks off of him.  I am returning the frontline I purchased at the vet because I don't have money to waste.  I have heard that the ticks are become immune to this stuff.  I will never use it again!!!
My mom's beloved Bichon Frise is the family pet.  The grandchildren all love her and we'd be lost without her.  Unfortunately, she is highly allergic to flea bites.  She also cannot tolerate a flea collar.  We have tried everything for this poor, sensitive dog and finally found Frontline Plus!  We apply it every 45 days because she's mainly an indoor dog and only goes out for using the bathroom.  The vet suggested every 45 days because of her sensitivities.  It works wonders!  We just started using it May of this year (2008) and she has not had a single reaction to fleas for the first time in the 10 years she's been alive.Every dog should have Frontline Plus applied to keep them flea free!  We no longer have to put her on allergy medication.  It's been such a wonderful product for her.
In all honesty, I'd rather not use this type of chemical product on my dogs.  I resisted for as long as I could but the so-called natural products were, sadly, ineffective.  I was pulling off a tick a day from them and I found a few of the little suckers crawling on me.  That was the last straw, so enter Frontline.  Bottom line, it works better than anything else I've tried. There's nothing more to say about it, except if someone knows about an effective natural/less chemically product, please let me know.
I have used Frontline Plus on all my dogs for years. It works great on my toy poodle and bichon; who are indoor 22/7.Now for my other dog a pitbull mix.. he gets ticks 3 weeks after I put in the application. I thought the ticks were suppose to die when they bit the dogs skin, but these ticks don't die! they feed on his blood :,( it gets bad. He stays outside 16 hours a day. I dont know why front line doesn't work with him. It works great with my other dogs.
My box was definitely genuine because I bought it at Costco. Did NOT get rid of adult fleas and the infestation is as bad or worse as ever. I have to find something that works because my pets are miserable and the house has fleas now too. Too bad these medications are all becoming useless. They used to work so well. Does anyone know which one actually works nowadays. All these meds are way too expensive to fool around with duds. I need something that works and is safe for my dog.
I've been using Frontline for years with my dogs. It has always been very effective, which is important living in a place with lots of ticks. After going on nature walks, it's nice to check the dogs and not find a single tick on them.  If only the same could be said for us humans :-).When I moved to VA, our new vet had us try another flea and tick product. One of my dogs had such a horrible reaction to it. Racing heart, panting, hyperactivity, that the vet had to give him a sedative. Needless to say, I'm sticking with Frontline. It does the job and my dogs tolerate it well.I always purchase this product through Amazon because you can't beat the price! I also make a point of choosing the 3 month supply boxes because the order is filled by Amazon. This is important to me because I know that I can count on a speedy delivery and that I receive the product I ordered.
It's so much cheaper on Amazon than in the stores and it really works. It takes a while for it to absorb- so you have to be careful not to touch your pet where you applied it- but once it is absorbed there is no odor or anything.  I took my dog to a nearby park. When we got back to the car I noticed he was literally crawling with ticks- but when I went to pull them off I saw that they were all as dead as a  door nail- it didn't take even half an hour for the Frontline to kill them all. I'm wondering if something that toxic can be good for your pet, but if you have to use something it may as well be a product that works.
I love frontline plus. My dog isn't exposed to fleas and ticks that often anyways. He is just a 14lb cock-a-poo. But he does play with the cat a lot and k9 advantix II explicitly states that their product is toxic to cats (the dog formula is). I had to return it immediately and have been using this ever since. My dog isn't a run through the fields and woods kind of dog, however I am sure that there are fleas out in the yard or on other dogs when he goes to dog daycare. He has never had flea problems and I have been using this for about 8 months now.
We use Frontline Plus for flea control because it works. We started with Advantage when our Golden was younger, and that worked well, too... but our dog likes to swim and Frontline is waterproof so we switched. She is 8 yrs old now and has never had a flea - which is amazing since we live in S.CA. near the beach where fleas abound and visit parks all the time. You are supposed to put on monthly... I end up putting on every other month and in winter every 2-3 months... seems to work fine with those intervals. Frontline isn't cheap - but Amazon has best price... Our Costco started carrying it for the same price, but no tax and free shipping gave Amazon the edge.
I live in Maine so needless to say it can be a bit buggy in the non-winter months, even in open spaces. I have been using Frontline Plus for my Great Pyrenees mix for years and have never seen a flea or tick on him- even after a day of romping through the woods and mud. He's also never had any adverse reactions to the product. I also like that I don't have to worry too much about my cats being around him when it's been freshly applied. Some other brands advise against cats being around dogs recently treated with their product. Not that my dog and cats cuddle but it's one less thing to worry about.
I have used Frontline on my dog for years, but this is the first time that I purchase Frontline Plus.  I cannot be certain that our problem is a direct result of the Frontline Plus, but my dog developed a growth and open wound at the place where this is applied.  I have contacted the company and they were very kind and made a report for their research.  However, the dog required medical attention and antibiotics.  Just wanted people to be aware to keep an eye on the application site just in case it was a direct result of this product.
We have used Frontline Plus for several years on our dogs and never had an issue.  Never seen a single flea or tick on them.  I have a lab who loves to dig and roll around in the grass and sand, and I haven't had any problems.  Last year we decided to try the new generic equivalent to save a few bucks since we are buying for 2 dogs.  BIG mistake.  We pulled off several ticks.  As soon as we could, we went right back to FP and haven't looked back.  It is worth the little extra money (there is not THAT huge of a difference in price) to be sure our dogs are safe from fleas, ticks and all the other nasties out there.
This product seemed to work for a couple of weeks at controlling fleas on our indoor dog who only goes out for exercise and to potty.  However one morning while combing her I noticed something stuck to her skin and much to my surprise it was a tick!  I thought it was very strange that the tick would be on her and still be alive considering that Frontline specifically states that it is for controlling both fleas and ticks.  Moving forward another month and it happened again - another tick.  This time I decided that this product just does not stand up to it's guarantee, nor does it work as advertised.  I will not buy again.Have since switched products, and have not experienced the same issue again.
I bought a Great Dane puppy who ended up having mange all over his head. I applied frontline and within a day the mange started clearing up. Within one week from the original application the mange was gone. I applied the frontline in between his should blades (not on his head).Another one of my Great Danes I had purchased was covered in ticks (literally hundreds) when I brought him home from the breeder. I used frontline on him as well and within one day the ticks were falling off. He had ticks all over his head, paws, belly, back, everywhere...and after applying frontline that evening, I could see the ticks falling off of him by the next morning.Frontline has worked well on all of my dogs and I have used it for many years.
I have been using Frontline Plus on my 19 pound Scottish Terrier for 24 months.  On three occassions she has developed a flea problem in between application times.  The most recent being last week.  Her flea application was Nov 7, 2010 and not due again until Dec 7, 2010.  However, after developing a flea problem last week, I had to bathe her and put on a new application Nov 22.  I am becoming more skeptical that this product works as it is advertised.  I do live in Southern California where fleas are almost a year round problem due to persons not cleaning up after their dogs.
Ok So I have used this product for the past two months and it is not working. I don't know why, it appears to be in the exact same box as the one you would get from your local vet. I know it says it takes at most 18 hours to take affect. Well It has been 10 days since my last application and I just had 3 F****** fleas jump off my little chihuahua and onto me. I am not happy about this at all. I only paid about $20 less than what I would have paid at the vets office. WHAT'S THE DEAL????Is this S*** fake ?????????????????I don't usually do reviews if the product is good. but when it is bad I do because I don't want anyone else wasting their money!!!JUST GO TO YOUR VET TO GET THIS. For some unknown reason this just isn't working and I am frustrated.
I've tried some of the major competing brands in an effort to save a few bucks, but Frontline continues to provide the best results for fighting fleas (on my three beagles and two cats).Last year, Frontline helped eliminate a flea infestation on my cats, when used in conjunction with other flea control solutions throughout my house. This year, we adopted three beagle puppies that were covered with fleas when we got them. Used Frontline again, at the recommendation of our vet, and the fleas were wiped out before they had a chance to re-infest our home.Continuing to use Frontline now to maintain our &#34;flealessness&#34;. I don't think Frontline Plus is perfect (It's expensive and doesn't seem to always last a full month), but for my pets, it's the best available and none of them display any adverse reactions to it.
I have been using this on my dog since he was a puppy at the instruction of my vet.  It seems to work reasonably well as he has never had any problem with fleas or ticks that I could see.  The product is easy to apply although the packages are sometimes a little bit difficult to open.  It also seems to cause my dog's skin to itch slightly as he will always start rubbing his back against the carpet when I put it on each month.  Generally, it seems to be doing its job, however.  If you buy it in a pet store like PetSmart it is sometimes $20 more than it is here on Amazon.
When frontline first came out it was strong enough that 1 dose would last on one of my dogs for over two months, it's not that strong anymore it seems.  It does however, work really well.  I want to use it specifically because it kills fleas as eggs and adults.  It will help with ticks but they are very hard to get rid of.  I get this size pkg and divide it up between my 8 dogs who range in size from 22lbs to 90 lbs. My vet gave me a syringe to get the liquid out of each of the vials and advised me on the correct dose for each dog.  It really saves money!
I use Frontline Plus every month on my 25 pound mutt and so far it has worked perfectly. She has had no flea, tick, or lice infestations whatsoever. In fact, I've witnessed ticks jumping on to her and then jumping or falling off soon after without attempting to burrow beneath her fur. The chemicals in Frontline Plus are absorbed into the dog's skin and are very effective. I don't like to think about how they might be harming the dog....she seems not to notice the monthly application or the slight chemical smell.
Many of my friends say Frontline does not work against fleas or ticks in their area any more, so have switched to other flea/tick control brands.  Well, it still works for my dogs, though we really don't have many fleas where we live in the desert.  I mostly used it when we lived in an area where ticks were prevalent.  I use it on the dogs only about every 3-4 months, just in case, as I do attend dog shows, and don't want to bring any visitors home with me...  Be aware that studies show that Frontline can be detected on humans' hands weeks after applying to the dogs...so wash after petting. ( Advantage showed transfer to humans for even longer periods of time, and that is imidacloprid, so would never use that product.  )
I'm training a puppy and he LOVES this.  I got the liver flavor.  My only complaint is that it doesn't last long, so it's a pricey &#34;treat&#34;.  It fills the kong toys well - put through the smaller bottom hole and use the toy to bend the nozzle and it fills up the toy nicely w/o mess.  It's cheapest on Amazon (from what I've seen so far).  But my pup has this polished off in no time at all, so it's only a short break while he's busy with the kong... I'll only use this for special rewards in the future
All 3 of our dogs love the various vitamin-enriched "tasty pastes" available through Kong.  Although they loved to chew on their Kongs before, we found that they really got into it once we started inserting some of the paste into the Kong cavity.  All of them go nuts when we put down the "pasty Kongs" for them to enjoy - and enjoy them they do!I would highly recommend all of Kongs' "tasty pastes" - it's easy to use, doesn't seem to make a mess, and is a great extra treat for dogs.  Our 3 give it "2 paws up"!
My dog loves this! I squirt in in or on her toys when she's done something to deserve at treat. She wiggles her whole body when she sees the can. It's easy to use, and the &#34;wand&#34; at the top is long enough that you can put it slightly inside a Kong so that the dog can spend some time licking it out. I like to put this inside a Kong and then chill it in the freezer for several house. I live in Texas, so my dog loves this when it's really hot (all summer).
I bought this because it's a tad more affordable than Natural Balance's food roll.  I cut this roll up into bite size pieces and use it as a positive food reward when training my dogs.  Much to my suprise, both my cats LOVE this stuff as well so I crumble a bit of it into their food and they gobble it right down.  My eldercat is thin and I have a hard time keeping weight on her, and she will just about do back flips for this stuff.  Came as a huge shock to me because she only likes sweet, creamy treats like cream and yogurt.  Anyway, 4 lbs cut into cubes will last you a pretty long time, and when fed as treats won't cause your animal to have gastric upset.. atleast not mine.  2 thumbs up!
Previously I had fed our Lhasa other brands of food rolls in different flavors but after trying Redbarn Food Rolls, our four-legged companion voted her favorite flavor as Redbarn Beef.  I alternate morning and evening food between the food roll and kibbles. The 4-pound food rolls are so easy to store in the fridge and for long-term in the freezer.  I slice a whole roll into 1-inch slices and then halve them before dividing into two containers - one container for every day and one container in the freezer for future use.  I stick with the Zukes Mini Treats (all flavors) for bribes and training treats.  The food roll is boxed with bubble packing and arrived within a day or two after I placed my order.
I first bought the Redbarn Food Rolls to supplement the &#34;weight maintenance&#34; dry food I was feeding my 2 miniature poodles.  The dry food had been recommended by the breeder.  The dogs LOVE both the Redbarn Beef and Chicken & Liver rolls!  I found too, that the ingredients actually surpassed the nutrition supplied by the dry food and contained less calories than the dry food.  I still use the Redbarn as a supplement, giving each dog one half of a 1/4&#34; slice morning and again at night.  They each first devour their share of this product and will later go back to finish the dry food.
this food is great if your cat doesn't have any issues like itchy skin or tummy issues.  If you have a cat with skin or tummy issues, it's time to get rid of the chicken and try a new protein, like rabbit.  All of my cats have really enjoyed this food, despite having some unbeknownst to me, chicken issues.  I have switched one cat to nature's logic rabbit with tremendous success and plan to put the other two on it as well to give them a break from this food (anything chicken), but if it weren't for that, this and the turkey version have been big hits in my house, including the cat that has tired of other brands of food quickly in the past.  Per Dr. Becker's protocol, I'm going to give their systems a break from chicken for a few months and then slowly transition them back, hopefully keeping them all itchy and dirty litter box feet free.
My 3 Maine Coon cat (huge cats!) would die without this particular blend of Wellness if it disappeared.  It is their less healthy treat, but still much more healthy than any of those old school branded canned foods at Walmart/Target/the Grocery Store (including Hills and Science Diet).Look up how to feed an obligate carnivore and how to calculate the actual dry matter protein matter of a food and its importance compared to these indigestible unnecessary fattening carbs.  Cats are not dogs.  The have never evolved to eat our scraps, and therefore they can't use things like corn, wheat, or even the fruits/sweet potatoes/potatoes.  This has the more healthy fillers (no corn or wheat) and a much more competitive dry-matter protein content compared to most brands.  Also, there is cranberry which will definitely help your older cat's bladder/UT system.
My cats enjoy eating Wellness Chicken and Herring (they didn't like the turkey). I like giving them a high quality food. But when I ordered a case several of the cans were badly dented so I did not use them. Not from shipping, because the dented cans were not on the outside of the pack but on the inside which means someone deliberately packed dented cans. This defeated my goal of saving money by ordering online. It is better for me to buy them from the store so I can be sure the cans aren't damaged.
Love this product!!! My old dog has been taking this human grade form of Cosamin DS for years and it's kept his joints limber.  It's cheaper to buy the human grade than it is the pet grade for him.  I like this seller and as long as the prices stay reasonable I'll stick with ordering from them.  I also give him Earth Animals holistic : &#34;Aches/Pains drops directly into his mouth 2 x a day to ward off any pain from old age. (don't give your pets drugs that will destroy their organ's)  He's doing great!  Hope this helps someone else.
Our German Shepherd, Gabby, is so energetic when we give her these, which is every morning. She does prefer the roasted beef Zuke's better, but loves these, also. The vim and vigor that she gets from these are unbelievable and she is very peppy after consuming the recommended amount. I think highly of this product and believe that the ingredients make a huge difference in the well being of our pup! She is happier, springier, and does not act like an old lady, like she used to! Awesome stuff!!
My dog absolutely loves these treats and I really feel they have helped her! She has a congenital hip problem and now arthritis has set in. She has a very pronounced limp after laying down for awhile, but since she's been eating these treats, we've noticed a difference in her not limping nearly as bad. I was going to purchase another bag this past week, but the price jumped up over $3.00 per bag in the short time since I purchased them the first time. I ended up looking at more treats with glucosamine in them and bought something else that seemed to be a better price & she at least likes them. I really wish the price hadn't jumped up so much because I would have bought more, but the difference was too much for me!!
My dog loves these treats, I typically try to give one a day but with all the other treats she get's often a day or two is missed.  No worry as long as you supplement the desired ingredients for hip/joint in other products or food.  The treats are soft and good for dog's of all ages, no choking worries.  The nice thing about Zukes is the ingredients list is not a mile long and they don't use meat by-products and you also don't see a lot of strange ingredients that are common in the mass marketed products.
My 15 year-old 80# mixed-breed dog had slowed down noticeably. I followed the directions on the package but didn't see much difference after 2 weeks. At the end of the third week of feeding these treats once a day Herbie started running again. At the end of the month, he is romping and playing with my other dog like he is a puppy. I just watched him take the stairs 2 steps at a time. It seems like these treats took longer to work but once they kicked in my arthritic old dog now thinks he is a strapping young man.
Very healthy treats for a 7 yr. old 93 lbs Doberman. He loves working for these treats, butbecause they smell so good, he pays more attention to the treats than to the commands I givehim. So he'll do two or three commands at the same time, hoping that's the one I want himto do so he gets his treat faster :-)My dog has no problems with his joints, but as he gets older, I hope to prevent that by givinghim the right food and treats. He has some catching up to do for the first two years of his life,when he was abused. At age two, he only weighed 39 lbs when he was rescued. I have hadhim for five years now and have spoiled him rotten. But it's nice to know I can do that in a healthy way!
We have tried different supplements for our 11 year old Golden Retriever but he kept having a hard time getting up. After about a week on these he is getting up a lot easier, we see a huge difference. Granted, he's not getting up as quick as our 2 year old but we absolutely see a difference. I highly recommend this to anyone!Update 12/3/2013:We upped him to 5 treats a day and WOW, he is getting up a lot faster and is even walking faster. He weighs about 100 lbs and 5 seems to be the correct amount for him. If you feel like there is no benefit for your dog try upping it for a few days and see if there is a difference.
I have a senior maltese who is prone to knee problems.  He began experiencing pain in his legs when jumping on and off the couch so I decided to get these for him to help with his joints.  I give him one each day and I have not seen him limp or yelp in pain ever since I started giving these to him, which has been over a year.  The best part is, he loves the taste of them, and when I open up the baggie, he gets super excited and starts wagging his tail and licking his lips!  I knocked off one star b/c I have noticed that some bags are not as fresh as others (no I haven't tasted the product myself but the fresher products are softer and the older ones are harder).
I use Zuke's Hip Action treats on my 15 year old miniature schnauzer. I noticed last year she was having trouble getting up the stairs. These were recommended by a coworker (I work in a popular pet store chain) over expensive pills. Now she jumps and walks normally again, her joints aren't as sore. She loves these treats and gobbles them up, even though she's very picky. The price here is also a great value, I bought them at $10.99 a pound, the store I work at is $9.99 for half a pound, so this is a great deal!The only con to it is that there are no preservatives so they go dry/stale very quickly, so make sure to dose daily. They're a better deal than most supplement pills out on the market and a lot easier to feed to dogs. Highly recommended.
My two mini-dachshunds love these treats. They're made of quality ingredients, with meat listed first, and are produced in the USA. I like that they contain supplements for joint health since dachshunds are prone to spine and joint problems. The pieces are too big for my little dogs, but they're soft and chewy so I can easily tear them apart. I've had the same bag for about a month now since my dogs don't get treats every day, and the treats are still nice and soft, not stale at all. These treats would probably be great for older dogs with dental problems, too, since they're so chewy.
Our 14-year-old was starting to get stiff in his hips.  We tried a supplement on prescription, from the vet first.  That really helped, but the "treats" were like little hockey pucks, with the consistency of jujubes.  The dog didn't like them.  These treats have the same active ingredients, so we gave them a try. They are great!  Our dog loves the taste and he really looks at them like treats and not like something he'd rather hide under the rug.  We matched the dose up to what was prescribed and he's doing just fine.  These are also less expensive.  The only problem is keeping them away from the puppy, who also thinks they are delish.  It's awesome that these are available on Subscribe and Save!  Of course, like all Zuke's treats, they are made in the US and the ingredients are actually food products and not by-products.  We have never used a Zuke's treat that was bad.
Car insurance rates are astronomical in my city, so I gave up my car and rent one when I need to do shopping, errands, appts, etc.Run out of healthy dog treats?  NEVER!!!  I order them from Amazon  -- one of their trusted merchants makes sure my Lulu has what she needs, on time.  OR, I could spend $30 in gas for my rental car going to the burbs to pick up what I gotta have!  Lulu thanks you and I thank you, Amazon.
We've always liked Zuke's products so when looking for a glucosamine supplement, Zukes's was near the top of my short list of candidates. I chose the Zuke's treats because each contains 300 mg of glucosamine and because the formula contains no wheat, corn, soy, by-products, or artificials.Not everyone agrees on the efficacy of glucosamine, but I've taken it for years with wonderful results, and our bichon with problem hips showed marked improvement while taking glucosamine.These square treats are soft and easily broken into pieces if desired. Our Piper gets a Zuke's treat every night and eats it with gusto. When this bag has run its course, I'll be ordering another.
I have been using Zukes for my Shihkingnese Dary for about a year.  She was having difficult with her rear hind quarter.She would often skip on her rear right leg.  I saw this product at a local pet boutique, and I decided to give it a try.After about a month of use, I noticed that Darby was no longer skipping.  However, when I was not consistant with its use she began to skip again.She likes the flavor and considers it a treat.  When I forget, she immediately reminds me that her treat is in the bed side table.  When I used the product regularly, Darby did not skip.This package is much larger than the one I purchased in the boutique.  It is also much more cost effective.I ordered this particular order for my Dad's 12 year old pit, Angel, because he was worried about her mobility issues.I thought if it worked for Darby, surely it would also work for Angel.
That was before they sold out to Nestle Purina.  We all know what happens to companies who sell out to mega corps - the quality suffers, they start out saying everything will remain in house under watchful eyes - that never happens. Already Nestle Purina has brought in their own management team. The ingredients will probably start becoming imported from china! The very reason Zukes came in to existence was has a quality option for pet parents who don't want to buy into the mega corp crap. Zukes will NEVER be welcome into my house again. Ever. Nestle Purina - makers of Waggin Train and Canyon Creek Ranch - that crap killed hundreds of dogs starting in 2010 when Nestle Purina bought that company. NEVER. Again.
I have 3 spoiled dogs.  Puperoni was the only pricey soft treat they'd eat.  Then I tried beef Zukes as something cheaper and different.  They smell awful to me, but the dogs all grabbed these little squares and gobbled them up....to my surprise.  I then bought the Chicken Zuke's, which they rejected.  So It's back to the beef recipe.  Since all my dogs are older, I figured that the extra benifit of 'hip action' would be a good thing
Supplements are difficult to evaluate since they don't work instantly like drugs and their effects are often subtle but I have been taking two of these a day for at least 6 months and it has not helped my knee pain.  I'm sure the ingredients may be good for me in other ways - I have read that this is true - but since the problem for which it was recommended by the health food store owner in my area was knee pain and it has not made a dent in that, I will give it the benefit of the doubt and award it three stars - the three stars are for the good effects it may be having that I haven't noticed.
I initially bought this item to help with the minor pain I get daily from inflammation.  However, I find it works ok for the inflammation, not as good as I had hoped, but by surprise it certainly helps with my night sweats and hot flashes.  They have decreased immensely and I don't feel so uncomfortable when I'm shopping and break out into a great sweat.  Not sure which item in this does the trick, but I'm one happy camper.  I sleep better too!  Give it a try, it's not a bad price either.
The ingredients are pure, and a great synergy of the top herbal treatments. They're a bit smaller than most liquid pills. You can smell and taste them, but I enjoy that since they're partly robust culinary herbs (however, I also enjoy traditional chinese medicinal herbs most of the time). I can't directly attribute positive results to them with total certainty. But I do feel better. I haven't caught the widespread colds, even at home. And my back pain has relaxed significantly (although I've also been doing physical therapy, so I can't say which is having more of the positive effects). Given how clear it is now that systemic inflammation is largely responsible for so many common ailments, I believe what the company says that this should be deemed as requisite as daily multi's.
Since I have only used one bottle and it takes 2-3 bottles to achieve full effectiveness, I can only rate it 4 stars. Overall, I feel that it works as it says it does. I have noticed I take a lot less ibuprofen for joint pain. In fact, in the last two week, I haven't taken any. I have a chronic shoulder injury that I just re-injured at work this past Friday. I didn't need to take anything for the pain. I just took the Zyflamend as directed and a hot bath. The shoulder feels okay, I can tell it is healing. I will definitely be purchasing another bottle. I have shopped around for pricing and it is sold elsewhere online for almost half price. Be sure to do your homework before purchasing for the best deal.
i was having a lot of trouble with my hip this summer and my chiro suggested i try this in addition to taking it a little more easy in the gym.  i was happy to try it since i was popping ibuprofen like pez.  it wasn't immediate, but, the pain has pretty much subsided. i'm finally running again and the only pain i feel are in the muscles that are still tight around the side of my hip. i am making sure to gently stretch and foam roll to reduce tension and soreness.
I am a runner and every day exerciser. I liked the idea of the Zyflamend and when it was offered to me through the Vine program I jumped to get it. Well, I have been taking it for just about a week now, and I can tell you that I have not derived any benefit from this with the exception of some really bad stomach and intestinal troubles. I am not sure what is causing it. From looking at the ingredients, it looks like a lot of the stuff I already have in my spice cabinet (oregano?), but there is something in here which does not agree with my digestive system. So, after a week of taking it, I am done. Thought I would develop a tolerance, but it never happened no matter what I did (eating or not eating before or after taking it didn't make a difference either). Maybe it's just me, so I am rating it a two star instead of a one star.
I've been using more and more of the New Chapter products because I've found them to be high-quality and effective.  This one is no exception.  The only downside is that you really, really have to make sure you eat first before taking this.  A lot of supplements say to take them with a meal, but mostly you can get by without taking them with a meal (at least I can).  However, if you take Zyflamend without eating -- and I recommend eating first, not just popping your pill at the same time you eat -- you will likely end up with a burning upset stomach.  It's an effective product, though.  So as long as you remember to eat first, I'd say try it and see how it works for you.
My mom suffers some age-related joint pain, and I had her try this herbal remedy.  It seemed to help, and just as significantly didn't seem to cause any side-effects or gastro issues for her (she's normally very sensitive to many medications).With this sort of remedy, it's hard to separate actual effects from the placebo effect, or from combinations of other hard-to-quantify variable such as the weather, activity levels, diet, etc, but it seems like it may help, and it doesn't hurt.
I've had great results from taking New Chapter Zyflamend.  My blood pressure is back to normal and it's really helped with pain from inflammation in my spine and neck due to years of arthritis.  My husband uses the Zyflamend Night Time...2 gel caps about an hour before he goes to bed.  After having trouble sleeping for several years he's sleeping very well without waking up several times a night to go to the bathroom.  I had a wee bit of heartburn the first few days I took it but my stomach got used to the herbs very quickly.  I have a sensitive stomach and I'm having no problems taking this at all now.  I do take it with food.  I highly recommend this product.
I have a 7 year old Maltese, and a nine month old miniature schnauzer. The size of these treats was fine for them, and after some initial reluctance at the unusual flavors (pizza and cheese, with chicken and beef being the normal flavors) the dogs seemed to like them. However, the day after I began feeding them Scooby Snacks the Maltese began throwing up, and the Schnauzer had alarming, unnaturally colored diarrhea. It did not immediately occur to me that it might be the treats, but the next day when the symptoms continued I stopped feeding them treats altogether and all upset ceased. Nobody else seems to have had this problem, perhaps I simply got a bad batch, but I am not willing to try these again.
These are perfect for stuffing toys, like kongs and other types with smaller holes.I put round and square ones into my Aussie's large regularly shaped kong, and the biscuit-looking ones into my rat terrier's stuffable chew toys. She doesn't get the regularly shaped kong, because her jaw is smaller than the kong's opening, so she fishes the cookies out very easily. She gets other toys (from Petsmart) which are very tough as well, but have smaller openings, like KONG Stuff-A-Ball. It takes her over 20 minutes to get them out.  These cookies are much harder than regular biscuits. It takes her 5 minutes to get the regular biscuits and snaps out of any toy.my rat terrier is a very powerful chewer...
I have a miniature dachshund that is addicted to table food. Normaly I leave dry food available at all times and 1 bowl of wet food a day. He has always been a picky eater, basically just wanted human food. Recently he would take a bite or 2 of his dry food and barely touch his wet. So we decided to switch dog food, and ended up choosing this. He LOVES this stuff, I can't leave dry down anymore because he gobbles it up before it hits bowl! Also we buy the containers on Beneful wet food, he loves that as well!Another thing that I love about this food is it makes his coat shiny and soft. Not sure how but ever since he started eating this he has had softer and shinier coat.
This was a better price than at the big box store, and it came straight to my door. That's a double bonus! I really appreciate the easy-to-open tops on these; start in the middle, and peel the tape off - easy as can be. My pooch loves, loves, loves beneful dog food. I think it's because there are moist bits as well as crunch bits, but whatever the reason, she literally foams at the mouth when she eats it. The flavor I purchased was Playful Life, but there are quite a few different kinds and sizes. My dog also likes the Fiesta and the Original.
I've used Pet Tab vitamins in the past, but have recently been disappointed to find that many of them are produced in India or outside the U.S.  Vetri-Science products seem to be of good quality and reasonably priced, so I thought I'd try these when I ran out of my Pet Tabs.  Unfortunately, the dogs don't seem to care for them.  My older dog spits them out even with peanut butter on them.  Once my puppy finishes these, I'll not re-purchase since they don't readily eat them.
I haven't noticed a difference in my dogs' appearance or health since taking these for several months. My vet thinks dog vitamins are only good for &#34;making expensive dog urine.&#34; I still give these to my dogs but I don't think I will reorder. I improved the quality of my dogs' food and started giving them coconut oil supplements and will probably just stick with that.NOTE: When these arrived, my dogs did break into the container and eat about 80 vitamins between the two of them. They vomited and had diarrhea for 24 hours and ultimately cost me $800 in vet bills... they are fine now and actually had no side effects after the stuff left their systems, but just a warning to keep these out of reach and watch out for potentially toxic iron levels if they're binged on.
I adopted Sam from a local shelter.  He had a dull, brittle coat, constant rash and other health issues.  I had him allergy tested and found he was allergic to some 40 foods and environmental allergens.  The allergy testing places compiled a list of dog foods he could eat.  All were expensive ($60+ for a 30lb bag) and hard to find where I live in rural Alaska.  But we love our dogs up here and I found that I could get Avoderm on Amazon for a hair over $40 for a 30lb bag with free shipping.  I haven't made my postman happy, but my dog loves it and I love the price and ease.  Sam can't have potatoes, peas, and a lot of grains, so Avoderm has really changed his life and mine.  Thanks Amazon!
I feel fortunate to have looked on Amazon for our regular dog food, and have been getting it here ever since.  You can't beat the home delivery AND saving at least $10 with every bag (I have Prime so I don't have the added shipping cost).  My dogs are a rat terrier and a JR terrier.  Ages 8 and 12 respectively.  They have been eating this food for years and are in perfect health.  I do give them human food too.....turkey, pasta, meat loaf, carrots, apples....mac n cheese...they get a small portion of whatever we are eating about once a day, but their main diet is this AvoDerm.
My dog was eating a high end food with a high price tag and it just wasn't working out!  My wallet was thinning but my dog became extremely miserable.My dog just moped around and had no energy and was becoming a real grump and very moody. I foolishly thought he was just getting older but that obviously wasn't it.I picked up a bag of this food at my local supermarket and my dog Beau's life came rushing back! He has his energy back, he enjoys eating his food, plays and initiates play just like he used to, and his hair is super soft.My dog is a Maltese which is a toy breed, so I have to break the pieces in half with my fingers. Sort of a pain, might try little bits with beef by Smartblend next time.I would have liked to have purchased it here at Amazon but they only sold it in a small bag. But I researched the product here before I bought it elsewhere.
If my dogs like like the taste of Purina One and they eat it, then there is not more that I can say except I trust Purina products. I am always looking out for the best products at a reasonable price and through the years Purina products have provided food that is healthy and balanced, at a reasonable price, and most importantly, my animals like the taste. Most of our dogs and cats live to their teen years, with two of our cats living to 19 and 20 years old, this I think I it in part due to Purina products.
My dog loved the original Purina One Adult Chicken with Rice Dog Food.  However, since Purina developed the smart-blend, she won't eat it unless I add some turkey.  The tan color pieces are awful - kind of rubbery.  I went back to buying the regular Purina Chicken and Rice Mix where all the morsels are pretty much the same in size and color.  My dog really likes the older version much better.  I won't be buying the blend mixture again. Sometimes, change isn't better.
My cat just gobbles this food up! We were feeding my cat Scamp Fancy Feast dry cat food that he loved until the last bag. That food changed in shape, color and odor. It became offensive to me and the cat went on a hunger strike. So I had to do something and fast.My dog loves his Purina Smartblend dog food so I decided to switch my cat to their cat food. And I am so glad that I made the switch. The smell is not offensive, I like the tan and brown pieces in two different shapes.It has only been a little over a week since Scamp has been eating this new food and when he was at the Vet today, I was told what a luxurious coat my tabby cat has.
My cats love this and even my older 17 yr old cat which passed in 2012 was spunkier after eating this for a few weeks.  When I could see the difference, I knew there was something to this.  They eat the tuna and salmon flavor.  One bowl of this along with one of the flat cans of moist Friskies food split between each cat is what was the guaged right amount for my two cats per day.  They nibble on the dry cat food throughout the day, and look forward to the fresh moist food each morning and by the evening, it's gone.  Any more is too much; less will render lots of complaints with loud meows before the evening's done.
My cats love this food...and the price is right.( usually a bit cheaper than any store) If you'll read the ingredients, the FIRST ingredient is not chicken meal or some by product, it's real chicken!! The cats love it, and it's very nutritious. We took this bag to our Veterinarian and showed him what our cats were eating...he was pleased and said go ahead and feed them this..and he had tons of food in his office he could've tried to sell us for our one cat's sensitive tummy.  He said this food is great!!  We won't feed them anything else!
My cats, all under 10 months old, all love this food.I mix it up, dry, with a Science Diet kibble, one to one, and they eat every last crumb in the bowl. They commonly don't pick up pieces from the floor, but I won't hold that against them. I do not mix this with water, so it never gets soggy. The bowls are often completely empty in the morning. This is in addition to the canned cat food I give to all 6 cats. They eat their fill of the called, and even leave some behind, if it is not up to their standards, but they never leave any of this dried food behind.My cat's love it.
My cats loved this. They had energy, their coats looked shiny and had less dander. Compared to Blue Buffalo, this is better and less expensive. But it is still quite pricey so I switched to Purina Friskies which is garbage, because I had to save some money this month. I did some research and the Purina One formula looks pretty good. I would say it is between the Friskies and the Beyond. The first ingredient is real meat. I looked up what "corn gluten meal" is in the regular Purina One (not Beyond) it is a decent/inexpensive source of protein. It isn't actual gluten at all, it is the second ingredient on the list. I am going to try the Purina One next. And if there are coupons for this one I will get this one. It is really good. I would recommend, especially over Blue Buffalo and Wellness, in my humble opinion.
I would usually be taken aback at buying a Purina cat food, as I've become something of a nutrition nazi when it comes to feeding my cats.  Typically, I'm a big believer in Natural Balance, Blue, and Wellness.  Having said that, one of my cats is allergic to fish, and finding dry food that doesn't have fish is quite a task (canned food without fish is conversely, very easy to find).  Trim that list even further by finding a sans-fish dry food that my cats will actually EAT.  Found this food by Purina (I suppose One BEYOND is one step above just &#34;One&#34;), which doesn't contain any fish, and (amazingly for Purina) doesn't have any significant grains/carbs.  The final hurdle?  My cats just damn love it.  I won't say it's the most nutritious option out there, but sometimes the nutrition vs. cat taste appeal has to be balanced out.
The food itself contains good ingredients.I was checking out different dry cat foods because my cat may be allergic or have some sensitivity to certain foods, mostly wheat.The only problem is that my cat is very selective of what she eats and when I mixed this with her food, she sniffed out what she wanted to eat. I tried giving this to her by itself and she sniffed and strayed off.My guess is that the smell or flavor is not the kind she likes. In addition to that my other 5 cats won't eat it either. I gave it 3 stars because the ingredients seem good enough, though my cats don't like it and won't eat it.
My cats think this is delicious, and it doesn't have any of the problematic ingredients associated with the food recall of a few years back.As some people who have read my other reviews know, I have a feral cat who has CRF, and she is a very very finicky eater.  She also cannot keep down food that has too much junk or bad quality protein in it.  The protein levels on this are lower than you will find in a lot of commercially available foods, but it's high quality protein (more salmon than animal meal and by=products).  The phosporus levels are also acceptable for cats whose kidney function isn't great, but you probably will want a phosphorus blocker just to be safe.Mary-Kate highly approves of this, and, for the price, you really aren't going to find a better dry food.
Our picky cat REALLY likes this stuff.  One problem was he was forever wanting more. We don't feed it to him always but its great to mix with other food he likes less. It seems to set well with him - we have to watch his food as he's had urinary and hairball issues.  We've tried other stuff he doesn't like and his tastes seem to change every 4-8 months so we switch around a lot.  Tried this one and we'll buy more to add to the rotation.
I switched my 2 Kindey issue patients to this for maintenance after having UTI and blockage. Of course they got Vet care and were on the Hill's diet S/D and C/D for a while.That food is too expensive (especially if you run a small rescue like me), so after consulting with my vet she recommended this brand (w the cranberry), as well as Blue Buffalo and some others.I fed this brand to my &#34;patients&#34; for a few months now and the kidney issue are in control, no blockages etc. I also give the supplement URI Soothe in addition to this. Male fixed cats are prone to kidney issues.I highly recommend it.
I can never find anything that my cats will love and repeatedly eat.  Until I found this dry cat food.  It is almost as if I do not have the same cats.  We have 2 Russian Blue's and they define the term 'picky eater'.  There has been more food wasted because they simply turned away.  Our female would rather starve herself than to eat something that she dislikes, and because of her, we have been searching for something; anything, that she would eat.  Thank you Purina One Beyond Cat Chicken Oatmeal!!!
I've been looking for a healthy food for my cats that they will like and doesn't break the bank.  I had tried dry Wellness, Science Diet, Blue Buffalo, etc and this is the first they LOVE.  When I first brought a bag home and sat it down one of my cats actually started tearing at the bag trying to get some.  After they started getting this I know as soon as their dry dish gets low because they start crying at me.  It also goes to note that one of my cats was having UTI's (which the vet said was likely from stress from our new dogs), but after a month of kitty prozac I switched the food and the UTI's stopped.
Have a cat that is 12 or 13 years old who has always had digestive trouble.Had been feeding him another brand,in which he would go crazy at the smell of it when opening the container.Even though he still liked the smell of that old brand of dry cat food,his teeth &/or mouth did not like it & i did not want to only feed him canned food.After reading a couple good reviews on "PURINA ONE BEYOND Cat Food,Salmon & Brown Rice" figured would see if the cat would eat this brand.Well the cat likes it,he is gaining weight,purring again & is playful again.NO upchuck clean ups---though have to empty the cats bouka box more often.
This One Beyond Salmon & Whole Brown Rice dry kibble is the only healthy dry food my 9 year old cat will eat. In fact, he loves it so much he eats it every night and never gets tired of it. He's is missing several teeth but has no problem chewing this small sized kibble. Real salmon is the first listed ingredient and there are cranberries, tomatoes and spinach along with whole brown rice. No corn or wheat. This product is not easy to find so I am particularly happy to purchase it through the subscribe and save program.
All 3 of our dogs love the various vitamin-enriched "tasty pastes" available from Kong.  Although they loved to chew on their Kongs before, we found that they really got into it when we inserted some of the paste into the cavity.  All of them go "nuts" when we put down the "pasty Kongs" for them to enjoy - and enjoy them they do!I would highly recommend all of Kong's "tasty pastes" - it's easy to use, doesn't seem to make any mess, and is a great extra treat for dogs.  Our 3 give it "2 paws up"!
My six month old Australian Cattle Dog mix loves this! He will totally just veg out on a toy with this filler in it for a good half hour or so-- even after the filler is gone, he will spend a while just licking the toy. To give him something to do in the day, I put Mother Hubbard treats in the Kong Traxx and squirt some of this filler on top-- if I remember I freeze it over night to make it last longer, but it works well unfrozen too.The one complaint I have is that this stuff seems to go SO quick-- I've had it a little over a week and it's definitely over halfway used. The bottle says that a little goes a long way, but not with my dog! Of course, I wouldn't mind getting more but at 7 bucks a bottle, it's definitely overpriced. That being said-- its a great treat for dogs!
For many years, the hedgehog plushies (of all sizes) have been a favorite toy for my dogs. It has become an 'essential&#34; toy. It seems to last longer than most, with Roscoe, my Border Collie, sometimes tearing the stuffing out of his toys. My mother introduced me to the toy when she had her lab, and ever since, every dog (I have 5 now) has one. I just bought this one on a lightning deal at Amazon, as Roscoe has lost his in the woods, and needs a new one. This entertains him for at least 30-45 mins, which is huge for a Border Collie.
We have an very large dog basket filled with toys. The stuffed hedgehogs seem to bring out the savage beast in my 10 m/o Schnauzer, I'm not sure why! She carries all of the sizes, from small to the jumbo, in her mouth for hours at a time. She also loves to chew these to death, squeaking endlessly, and tearing them apart. Be careful if you have a relentless chewer -- these won't last long for a dog who is obsessive like ours. I keep buying them because she loves them so much. Yeah, silly me. Just watch your dog for any ripping, tearing out the plastic squeaks, stuffing, etc.When our jumbo hedgehogs have bought the farm, so to speak, we then stuff the critters with squeaking tennis balls. That keeps our gnawing monster busy for a while longer.I highly recommend these hedgehogs no matter what size you choose. There's just something about them that brings out the primitive wild animal in your best friend.
This dog toy is a must-have.  Our pit bull only likes to play with stuffed toys, and sadly he manages to rip them up pretty fast.  This one will not die! It has 3 squeakers, and it's so cute (yet annoying) when we're watching tv and the dog sits by the sofa chewing on the hedgehog.  You can hear *eek* *eek* *eek* from the floor nearby.We replace it about every 3-4 months when the stuffing starts dribbling out and the fur gets all nasty.  This toy (or one of it's incarnations) has been living at our house almost as long as the dog has.
My border collie, Nora, was actually giddy with delight upon receipt of this hedgehog. She made up a game where she puts "Hedgie" on the bedroom floor then jumps up on the bed and POUNCES on the toy. It is big and it grunts, which she wildly loves, (the grunt isn't really that obnoxious, I've heard worse). Nora shakes it silly and throws it around, indoors and outdoors, and Hedgie is holding up just fine. Nora is not delicate with her toys and I've seen many bite the dust quickly. The hedgehog is very well made and keeps my border collie busy for quite a while. FUN! FUN! FUN! Kudos to EntirelyPets and Amazon!
I bought my first one when our Bullmastiff puppy was only 4 months old and he loved it. He would carry it around squeaking and tossing it. But--- as he got older he started focusing on the nose and eventually ripped it open and pulled the stuffing out. He was sorry to see it go and so was I so I bought him another one but of course he was older and immediately went for the nose. This time it didn't last two hours. Lesson learned, no more Hedgehogs but I still think it is a great toy for the right puppy/dog.
I have purchased about 10 of these hedgehogs in various sizes over the years, and they are still the favorite toy for the dogs. The small ones are good for playing fetch, the large ones are just the right size for disemboweling, and the jumbo size (bigger than a football) is great for playing tug-of-war. My last purchase was the Jumbo, which I intended to save for Christmas---when I accidentally opened the Amazon box in front of them, they leapt up, snatched it, and ran away with the poor hedgehog grunting and squeaking!True, a tough chewer can rip these hogs up and get to the squeaky guts, but I take them away at that point and patch them up for another go. Once they start to be more &#34;patch&#34; than &#34;hedgehog,&#34; it's time to order again. And if you have a very playful dog as opposed to a prey-driven beast, this toy should last a long while.
I have a two year old golden retriever who walks around the house with this in his mouth.  I bought this for a second home so I am not packing his toys besides my things.  This one is a jumbo one, didn't realize it was so big but he doesn't care.  He carries it around, puts in it my lap, waiting for me to throw it, I do he brings it back.  After awhile I put it in a basket and it is out again in five seconds.  Obviously he likes it....  These are well made; he hasn't tore it apart yet and it still squeaks.
So there are two versions of this hedgehog, there's Homer and Harvey. I have Homer, which from what I can tell, is the same as Harvey.I have the deluxe edition, which is very big. I like Kyjen's line of toys because they're cute and fun. My six month old labrador pup loves his Ginormous Gator and his tail-bait toy made by Kyjen so I decided to find more toys for him.The noise this toy makes is unbelievably funny. It's a low-toned squeal that sounds very hedgehog-esque. It's also shakeable for a rattle sound effect. However, beware that if your puppy is a tough chewer, he/she will chew through this cute toy in a few hours. My puppy began pulling out Homer's fur coat. This cute toy is almost bald thanks to the misbehavior of my rough puppy.Anyways, overall good toy but not very durable. This is definitely for older dogs who aren't still teething and know when not to be too rough.
My dog within minutes had had this torn, without even trying to destroy it.  He was only squeezing it to try and find the squeakers.  I heard a popping noise and assumed he must have poked a hole in said squeaker, but then I noticed a lot of exposed stuffing.It seems a tooth poked through, right on the seam of the face and body. It is unraveling rather quickly now.I'll still give it  3 stars, because this could very likely just be a fluke, as it otherwise seem to be durable enough.One more negative for me is, it's made in China.  I really wish Amazon would list a country of origin for products. It can't be that hard, I've seen they list counties for some items.
My pitbull mix loves her hedgehog, and although she destroys most toys in time, this lasts weeks (a lot longer than most and certainly than most soft toys).  This is probably because the fur on it is so dense that it is enjoyable to squeeze in her mouth and is a deterrent from locating and removing the squeaker immediately.  This is the only soft toy I now buy her, and ranks amongst her large Kong squeaker toys as one of her favorites.  Endless hours of fun and like photos already posted, she will sleep with her head on it.
Bought this toy for my shepherd mix who admittedly isn't a destroyer, but it's holding up great.  We've had it for about a week and it looks brand new.  The jumbo size is a lot of fun for him to chew on and the roundish shape makes it hard for him to get the leverage to really tear it up.  It is hard for me to hold on to for tug of war, but that's not a huge issue.  My favorite part is the grunting squeaker.  The dog loves it and the low noise isn't nearly so annoying as the squeakier ones.
We have developed some expert opinions on the variety of grunting hedgehogs available.We started out with one where the grunter was made of a plastic bag rubber banded to a grunt maker.  We know this, because the dog dismantled it in short order.  Then, we decided to pay a little more for another non Kyjen brand, but it too was short lived.  Finally, we went for the Kyjen.  It has been almost a week and the grunter still works, as does the rattle, but the squeaker has been smooshed.  This is a great improvement!  The grunter in this toy seems to be a harder plastic contraption and therefore seems sturdier.It's a little big for the 'tween dachshund, but it doesn't seem to bother her, so it doesn't bother me.  Like all the plush toys we've purchased previously, she pulls the fur right out.  A week into it, Homer is displaying male hedgehog pattern baldness.
The Hedgehog is another winner toy for our Lhasa pup.  The large is a bit much for her but she is up to the challenge and will have fun making it squeak and grunt.  Our pup does not intentionally destroy her toys but does eventually wear them out from playing with them everyday.  The Hegehog was included with several other dog toys and the whole lot was packaged very well and arrived within two days after I placed the order.Update:  Callie loves the Hedgehog and can make both squeakers work over and over.  She also loves shaking it and thus one of the legs near the body has a tiny rip in it.  After she was in bed, I quickly mended the tiny rip and our Lhasa is having a ball with one of her favorite new toys.
The previous dog I had, had gotten this toy and just loved it. She would love to squeek it and throw it into the air to catch it again. When I got another dog, I gave her the toys I had saved and she picked the hedgehog out and for some reason, she loves this toy too. So when I wanted to get a 'welcome' gift for a friends new dog, I bought this. He loves it!!  And it lasts thru many hours of play. Very sturdy..even thru tug of war.
I got this for the over sized toy poodle since the undersized bichon is ball and object crazy. The poodle prefers the bed, still. He just cannot be bothered to squeak the hedgehog. The bichon has adopted it and uses it every 3d day or so, rotating it with the squeak ball and the squeak Kong. I myself have to stop mp on it to make it squeak but the bichon can walk around the house squeaking it for a half hour or more.The only thing I can add is that he did not go directly to it the way he did with other toys.Maybe that was a signal that it would not be a favorite.  It is very well made but if the dogs don't like them you are just stuck unless you can find someone else's dog to steal it.
I have bought so many of these and each one &#34;dies&#34; sooner and sooner.  After the last two lived less than 15 minutes, I have said good-bye to this product.  For how much he gets to enjoy it before destroying it and having it taken away, I could buy him a doggie-massage for less money.  At least that would last an hour.Kyjen, if you are reading this, worry less about making it looking like a real animal.  Get rid of some of the weak points that draw attention and lead to destruction.  My dog doesn't need you to hand him a pointy nose to pull on or tiny, un-reinforced little feet to chew in.
My 63 lb Pit mix LOVES this toy more than any other and I think that is due to the variety of sounds it makes. It has what appears to be a baby rattle sound, a hog grunting and the traditional squeaker.  As with most toys I have to monitor his play, but of course life intervenes and it only takes a phone call or such to distract the vigilant pet parent, so he managed to rip off one of Mr Hog's legs and remove a little fluff. I'm too lazy to sew anything until major surgery is necessary (bodies are already piling up in pre-op) so we continue to play &#34;Fetch&#34; with Mr Hog and my pup gnaws on and tosses him about the house, under supervision of course.
My dog loves hedgehog stuffed toys. She carries them around and then lays with her paw on top of it, as if to show the world it's hers. Unfortunately, my other dogs are not as gentle and as soon as she looks away, they tear the thing to sheds.For non aggressive chewers though, this toy is great. It has the duck sound they love as well as a squeaker. I'll continue to buy these for her, knowing they won't last, but that's ok cause she is so happy when a new one arrives.
The fence is incredibly inconsistent. It will shock my dog at different distances, sometimes it won't shock at all, sometimes it will beep, sometimes it doesn't beep and only shocks him. It's impossible to train him properly when the fence is not consistent. I also tried this shock collar on my hand and it left my two fingers slightly numb for about 3 hours. This is not as small of a shock as I expected. I saw my dog shaking whenever I was trying to put the collar on him the last time and decided to just return it because it's just that awful.
I love, love the under ground fence. I got this little receiver for my new puppy. It is not so bulky and heavy, so it does not scare the pup by its weight alone. This allows me to teach the pup early to get her used to the boundaries and also allows her the freedom to play with the older dogs with out me worrying weather she'll get into the road or not. You will have to buy Their Batteries, but if you teach your dog early on how this works, they'll respect the fence and you will hardly use any batteries at all.
We have two dogs and have had this petsafe wireless containment system and these collars for over 7 years.  We are just now, replacing a broken collar.  The collar broke because it simply got worn  out.  The collars are worn all day, every single day and are only removed at night.  The dogs have never, ever, once left the yard to chase the many types of wildlife that are near our rural property.  It's an amazing and reliable fencing system and I have recomended it to many people.
I got this for my teeting German Shepherd puppy, and it's great for that.  She's not a super strong chewer yet.  But, I have to be careful that my adult Shepherd doesn't get a hold of it because she is a much stronger chewer  and can tear chunks of this loose.Then the puppy comes along and eats those chunks, and then she throws up.So, to review, good for puppies/dogs who are not strong chewers.  BAD for strong chewers.  Swallowing small bits of this = no big deal.  Swallowing big chuck of this = messy clean up (or potential other health problems).
My Golden Retriever puppy Bailey is 8 months, and he is a super chewer.  He can finish a 12" braided bully stick in 1-2 hours, devours knuckle bones in a couple of days, and tears up all of his plush toys!  We got him an expensive antler, thinking he would get lots of use out of it, but it was too hard for him and has no scent, so Bailey only half-heartedly chewed on it for 10 minutes, then abandoned it. We were desperate to find something for him that he enjoyed, but wouldn't be destroyed so quickly. (And dog toys are so expensive.)I think this Nylabone is a miracle!  It's listed for moderate chewers (which I think Bailey exceeds), but he's been chewing on it and carrying it around for days, and he's only made a small dent on one end.  I will be buying more!
I love Nylabone products!  Great for chewers.  My Golden doesn't chew very often, but when he does he really enjoys this one.  It's softer - which is great for their breed because they don't tend to be rough with anything.  This particular bone is good for moderate chewers.  Therefore, if you have a powerful chewer, don't get it!  The reason being - it's too soft & it will be destroyed within minutes.  The more powerful chewers (such as my Beagle), have even been able to break the bone in half.
My dog is a rescue and had really bad teeth so many of them had to be pulled.  But even with just a few, she LOVES to gnaw on this.  I love how focused she is when she get her nylabone... because she just really gets into scraping her teeth against it.I have bought several different nylabone flavors/types but she always seems to prefer the original and chicken flavor.I also follow the directions and steep them in chicken broth for a while so not sure it that flavor penetrates inside because I rinse it off after steeping.She seems to lose interest in them after gnawing off the nubs on one side... so they don't last too long.  In less than a year, she has gone through 8 of them.  I wish they were less expensive.
My dogs love, love, love the chicken flavor of this bone. It is large and heavy, a little too heavy for my little Bedlington Terrier but perfect for my 3 bigger dogs. My puppy who chews non-stop loves this toy and will chew on it for hours at a time. With the flexichew bones, you will see where the dogs chew but this toy is extremely dense and almost self sealing. It takes a LOT of chewing before it shows any damage. This toy will last my 4 dogs a while and it is a very good value for the money. Beats having to replace rugs and other things when the puppy runs out of chew toys.
This chew toy is a good texture for my dog- not too hard so that I am afraid of him breaking his teeth but not so soft that he is chewing pieces off. My dog is a very strong chewer and he has not, as of yet, taken chunks out of this toy. I have not yet left him alone with it, though, as I have read other reviews which say strong chewers can take this toy apart. The main downside is this toy only moderately holds my dog's interest. He was pretty excited about it the day I got it, but since then his interest slowly declined and now he hardly looks at it.
My akita really loves these flexible bones.  He isn't a super power chewer...he's the type that wants to lie down and chew on something for a half hour once or twice per day.  But still...he's an 85 pound young akita, so his jaws aren't weak.  He is making dents and flaking small pieces off, but nothing more than that.  We also have the skinnier one as well, which we got him as a puppy, and he still has that one too.  I think these are much better than the harder nylabones, because it's more rewarding for the dog to feel like he can actually &#34;chew&#34; on it.  But then I'm not a dog, so I wouldn't know....but it boils down to the fact that even though this is flexible, it is very sturdy, even for a large breed dog.  I can't guarantee it if you have a power chewer, but for the average chewer, it's perfect.
This dish is too deep for cats but what really annoyed me was the 45 minutes I spent trying to get the label off. I tried peeling it off, using soap and water, then Goo-gone, and then Goof-off. I scraped and rubbed and there is still a ton of adhesive stuck to the side of the frame. Now there's cat hair stuck to the adhesive. Lastly, when you lift the feeder up you have to make sure you hold it by the frame, otherwise the bowls pop out onto the floor. I threw it in the trash after about a week.
I used this for a couple months and ended up buying another product because of a couple issues with this one.- The bowls come with a sticker on them holding them in place. It's impossible to get it off without leaving some residue so you end up with a dirty spot in each bowl and one side of the holder has a big sticky area on it.- If the water is in the bowl for more than a day it gets a chemical smell/taste to it which I can't imagine is good for my pets- It's not attractive looking
I bought this for my 20 lb. poodle and it worked great.  The only thing I didn't care for is that I'd like to be able to take out the bowls and use them for holding water when I go hiking or a short day trip with my dog.  However, my dog is a chewer and when I tried that a few times he chewed up the plastic to the point that the bowls didn't fit in the grey holder any more.When I wanted to replace this feeder, I ended up spending just a few more bucks and going with the Our Pets 4-Inch Signature Series, Black/SS.  It's similar in size, but the bowls are metal which allows me to take a bowl with me when we go for day trips which can require water.  Spending just a few more dollars was worth it for the extra durability.
I use this for my cat & love it.  Since the bowls are removable I can change out just the water when starts getting gross or I can scoop fresh food into the other bowl when ever I need to.  The removable bowls are very handy because you don't have to pour out your food in order to replace the water.  Most bowls like these are permanently connected so if you kick the bowl or bump it by accident you end up splashing water into the food bowl making it soggy, then you have to change both bowls out to get everything fresh again.  I like this set because I can change the the water out many times without even touching the food side & I do not have to own separate bowls that can get scattered on the floor.
I have no question that this is high quality for my cats needs, but I just can't get him to eat more than a bite or two.  Then he is back crying for something different as he is still hungry.  Wish I could find something for kidney disease that he really would et.  I would be willing to pay a higher price as I am afraid he is slowly dying right in front of my eyes right now.  Because I stand stand him crying for food I end up giving him something he will eat which isn't specifically designed for his kidneys.
I have been struggling to get my cat to eat after her diagnosis.  She does not like prescription foods!  She will eat a Rx food for a day or two and then turn up her nose.This one is the one she tolerates the best.  I still have to mix something else in to get her to eat it, but she will eat it most days and will eat more of it than any other food I try to feed her.  I will be anxious to see how her readings are the next time we go in.  At this point, the vet said eating is more important.  So I do what I have to do!I do appreciate that this food is way less expensive than prescription food.  It also has a higher fat content than others, which I'm thinking is probably good for kidney kitties and keeping weight on them (although sometimes I wonder if it's a bit too fatty?).  Overall, I am happy and will keep ordering it.  Thank you!
I have a 14yo cat with kidney problems.  The vet gave us the Hill prescription diet K/D for our cat.  Our cat really didn't like that food and would only eat it occasionally.  We looked for alternatives that we could purchase online to make it easier than trekking to the vet's office.  We ordered a case of the Neo and our cat has been happy ever since!!  It is half the price of the Hill's K/D and being able to order it online has made this a win-win for the cat and us.Our trick to getting her interested in the food after it was refrigerated was to microwave for a few seconds.  She likes the food (has been on it at least 6 months), her appetite is good and her kidney levels are back in the normal range.
My 18yr old cat has had CRF for over 2 years. She  has never really liked her prescription renal food but tolerated it. Recently she has been losing weight and not wanting to eat her food. I thought I'd try the Hi-Tor after reading good reviews on it. I'm so happy I did. My cat loves it!!  I'm so happy to see her eating again. The food is very moist and she just digs in. It smells tasty too compared to that dried out canned prescription food. She is one happy kitty.
Like others here I am truly grateful for this stuff, which I believe has considerably prolonged my CRF cat's life (diagnosed 2/12, still going strong). Initially the vet gave us Prescription Diet wet and dry, which also like others, the cat didn't care for at all. Found this and mixed with small amounts of Fancy Feast, it pretty reliably gets eaten. I find switching up the FF flavor and microwaving the food if it's coming out of the fridge helps sell it as well.The one knock I have on the Neo is that after going through a number of cases we have found the actual consistency of the product can differ wildly per batch. Sometimes the food is quite firm, with one side of the can a jelly-like substance, while other times it is a soft and even mixture throughout. When it is firm I have to mash and mix it to make it more palatable to the boss. A minor niggle but one I would like to see fixed.
I was worried that my 17-year-old cat, who was diagnosed last week with kidney failure, would not want to eat his low-protein food. I'm lucky: he loves it. We tried three different brands (Hill's, Purina and Hi-Tor) and he loved them all. We went with Hi-Tor because it was significantly cheaper.Sebastian (the cat) eats it immediately. He likes it out of the fridge, too. Phew! I think it may be helping his kidneys. The reason I realized something was wrong was that he was peeing way more than I would have expected from one cat. I think the volume of pee has gone down somewhat since we started this food.It's weird that the best thing I can hope for right now is that I will have to keep buying this $25 a case cat food for a long time. But there we are.
So my normally 5 pound cat has been newly diagnosed with KD and dropped a pound at age 12.  A major problem when you're already tiny.  She will eat the Hi-Tor Neo, and likes it when I warm &#34;leftovers&#34; up for a bit in the microwave in a glass container, stir it up to a nice slurry, and she tends to eat about one third the can this way.  When given as normal spoons she eats just a bit, so the slurry is a good way to get calories in this cat.  She appears to be gaining weight and I'll keep buying it.
I'm not really sure what I was thinking when I bought this food, except that I was freaking out about my cat being diagnosed with chronic renal failure. The ingredients in this food are really not something I would normally even consider feeding to our cats, but like I said, I was freaking out! Usually cats like crappy canned food, so I figured, what the hell and opened a can. Not only did our chronic renal failure cat turn his nose up, but so did the other 3 cats. Oh, well! I'm sure it's better than any of Hill's Science Diet products, Purina anything, or Royal Canin's prescription diet, but not by very much.
If it lasted, it would be a good chew.  It's a little smelly but compared to a chew-hoof it's Chanel.  Puppy took it from my hand and went straight to work, and it lasted about 20 minutes.  He's a bigger chewer now but at the time he was not the most ferocious, and it would last maybe 8 minutes now.  No mess on the floor - little nibbled bits that stick to your socks - like you get with real bones.  No loose stool either, but there were some FUNKY smells going on in his vicinity a few hours after each bone.For a more durable chew without the stinkies, try an antler.  I'll post a review on those if I can find them in my order history.Based on the dogs I've owned, this would be great for a Sheltie, spaniel, bichon or other small- to midsize- puppy that isn't a serious chewer but needs a job to do to keep him out of trouble.
I bought these during Amazon's 4/3 promotion.  I have two golden retrievers who are spoiled badly and I am constantly looking for healthy treats for them.  These are perfect because I can open one package and have one bone for each dog.  They love these and sit waiting for them.  They are not soft but not like rawhide so when they chew on them, it helps clean their teeth.  There are enough vitamins and flavor to keep them interested until the whole bone is gone.  I would definitely buy again.
My dog is being treated for a condition that requires me to reduce her exercise level to almost nothing.  I'm desperately trying to find treats that will keep her quiet and aren't rawhide.  The vet told me I shouldn't give me dog rawhide on a daily basis, so I decided to try these edible Nylabones.My dog loved how these tasted, but she finished them in a matter of minutes.  The description calls these "edible chews," so I was expecting these bones to keep my dog occupied.  I wouldn't call these bones "chewy" either.  They seem to be slightly tougher than a Milkbone, but just as dry.  I have been a fan of Nylabone products for as long as I can remember.  I raised all my puppies with Nylabones, but these edible Nylabones don't last long enough.On the plus side, my dog did enjoy these treats and they didn't give her an upset stomach (she has a pretty tough stomach though).
I bought these bones for my adult dog and a couple of young teething puppies I was fostering.  My adult dog was able to devour these things in no time (I eventually got him the larger sized bones so it would at least last him a good minute instead of seconds).  The puppies loved to chew on these things and were determined to eat them as fast as they could.  When one puppy managed to finish, she would go after her sister's if she still had some left.  These things actually smell good enough that you might almost want to eat one.  haha  They don't last too long but they are a good treat for a dog, especially one who is teething.  They still don't last more than 5 minutes but if you want to spoil your dog, this is a good way to do it.
For the price, it would be nice if these bones lasted longer, but they do their job so I'm not complaining. I spoke to someone at a pet supply store who recommended these as an alternative to rawhide chews, and he said they're fully digestible, while being good for dogs' teeth and gums. My dog (a 30lb beagle/coonhound) LOVES the bacon flavor, and it keeps him occupied for a little while (probably about a half hour). At this rate, these are a little more expensive than rawhides, and serve the same function, but are safer for your dog, since they are more easily digestible than rawhide. Ultimately, these bones are a pretty nice treat for my dog, but I'll also be looking for some longer-lasting chews to keep him occupied for longer periods.
This works anywhere from AMAZING to pretty okay depending on the material. I was a little skeptical when buying this but now I'm glad i did. I recently bought a cat tree, my cats loves it and has already started shedding on it. This works great at taking all the hair out and handles all the corners.The hair lifter is slightly bigger than I expected and my hands are on the smaller side so I had trouble really grabbing it. I cut it in half and it works just as well.I've only just started using this so I will update*
We adopted our dog last summer and have tried various dog foods including the small breed formula from this same company. This is the one that our dog eats the best, and what comes out her other end is the easiest to deal with. No bad breath. Our dog scratches a lot and I was hoping this food would help that, but alas, no.If you sign up at Holistic Select's website they will email you coupons. So far I got one for $5 and one for $3. I don't know how (or if) to use them on amazon so sometimes I buy locally.This is small kibble suitable for small dogs. Don't know about big dogs. The pieces are flattish disks about 3/16" thick and 3/8" or so in diameter. They vary some.
We have four dogs and they have done very well with the Holistic Select line.  It's a bit more money but if you look at the ingredient list, you'll see why.  Our dogs have not had digestive issues and their skin and coat are healthy. I am also a happy camper for not having to drag a big, bulky and heavy bag from the store to car to home.  The product is priced right and shipped super fast.  Amazon Prime is so worth it especially if you order a lot of stuff online.
I've had 7 OES, and they are notorious for quirky digestion, manifested by loose stools, and hard to control diarrhea.This food and the Merrick Farms dry food are the only foods I've found that totally eliminate digestive problems  I would not have believed it, but this food actually produces stools so dry that they literally break apart and disintegrate upon striking the ground!  Amazing food.  Dogs love the taste, and it's reasonably priced.  I've used Solid Gold, Wellness, and many other brands.  If you want solid stools in your dogs, and excellent health, try this.
Of course my dog hardly likes any dry foods. But he really resists eating this as long as he can. Holistic Select is one of the best brands out there. I can't recommend it enough if your dog has digestive problems. It's the first food that got his stools to be usually pretty normal. But with this flavor, his poops seem rather soft again. Can't say for sure that it's this food. Also, Taste of the Wild is excellent. I think he likes it a bit more than Holistic Select. Holistic's canned food is awesome. He even loves it.
First I love this food. My pup has food allergies and she has gone through many top foods because of it. This is the first food in her 4years that I have been able to keep her on for more then a couple months.  I buy the large bag and have two dogs that it will feed for almost a month before needing more and both my dogs look and feel healthy and happy. No more chewing paws or stratching like crazy.  Both dogs also run to their feeding spot as soon as I get the bag out. Fishy smell is nothing compared to the help it gives my dogs. Shipping is always fast and hassle free. Love this product. Best thing I've done for my dogs outside of rescuing them :)
We got this toy on the day we got our German Shepherd puppy.  He loved it then and he loves it now (6 weeks later).  We have become completely dependent on this toy, because we add treats inside it every evening and give it to him in his kennel.  He runs to the kennel and is so excited to go to bed!  He does not really chew hard on it, just enough to get the treats out.  He has hidden it several times in the house, so in case we cannot find it, we bought a second one to be on standby.  Love this football!  LOVE IT!
I bought two of these--one for each of my Border Collies in size medium. The size is fine (about the size of 2 medium-sized tennis balls if you put them together). I was disappointed because I wanted to stuff this toy with pieces of cloth and treats so my dogs could &#34;un-stuff&#34; them, but the holes are just too small. Overall the toy seems well built, although it wouldn't stand a chance against a dog who loves to chew. Fortunately mine just want to play fetch with it and it's a good option for in the house because it's light and bounces quite a bit.
I have (6) dogs so getting a feeder that contains a bag of food and dispenses at timed intervals that I set made sense. Unfortunately, the feeder does not work as designed. When the timer goes off a heavy cable at the bottom of the feeder circulates thru the container to stir up the food, loosen it up and drop into the feeding bowl. But the cable would circulate and nothing would fall into the dish. I tried different size dried food but it still won't dispense any food. I looked for clogs but soon realized the cap was preventing food from entering, it either won't open or does not open enough. You would also need to keep this tank at least 1/2 full for it to sometimes work. Finally I have resorted to using it as a storage bin for the food. I scoop the food out myself and put it in the bowl. The large cable that plugs into the wall is unsightly! The design/idea is solid, the actual successful operation is flawed.
We are a two-cat household.  Our female cat has begun to occasionally pee in a corner, despite the fact that we have 4 litter boxes that I scoop several times a day.  We think it is a territorial issue.  I bought a bag of this litter and mixed it 50/50 with the old litter in one of the litter boxes and she loves it! She almost exclusively uses the one box that has this litter and I haven't seen her going in the corners anymore (it's been 2 weeks so I'll keep my eye out).  The litter clumps well, tracking is about average, and no dust.  No strong perfume smell.  If you are having a problem with your cat going potty outside the box give this a try.  I have also had good luck with Feliway diffusers to help decrease the aggression in our male cat. (both cats have been fixed so that's not the issue).  Good luck!
We recently aquired a young female cat and after 2 weeks she got a bug which caused diahrrea and loss of appetite, after which she decided the litter box had made her sick and started peeing next to the box rather than in it.  I purchased a new box and Feline Pine, which she refused.  After researching online I picked up a bag of Cat Attract and poured it in the new box (after removing the Feline Pine).  She has been using the litter box ever since.  Hurray!  I'm hoping to gradually switch back to World's Best Cat Litter because it's corn based and not clay, but Cat Attract has been very effective in getting kitty back to good litter box habits. Couldn't ask for a better product!
We purchased this to keep our dogs food in. It's very convenient and much easier than having to sift through a big bag. This container easily holds her 30lb bag of kibble with room to spare- in fact I'm betting almost an entire second bag would fit too. The wheels make it easy to move and we can store this in the pantry. It has kept the dog and 2 cats out of the food so far. I only wish we had opted for a smaller size to fit the pantry better, but I really can't complain.
I like this container.  It's easy to set an entire bag of dog food inside.  It rolls into my pantry and easily rolls out when needed.  I wish it was sturdier but as long as I don't drop the bag in (set it down easily instead) it should hold up.  Air tight?  Maybe but the plastic has a lot of flex so no, it's not air tight when you move it around or do anything with it.  I do think it seals well enough to keep bug out and the smell contained when it is left alone.
It is the third Iris container I have. One is for cat food. The other one is for my bread flour. This third one I needed for dog food. It is sturdy, it closes tight, and it holds a Costco-sized bag of dog food without any problems. Also, it is easy to move around on sturdy casters. Last but not least: it is still quality made in the USA. I am sure this will not be the last of Iris containers I buy. I am very happy with the purchase.
I resisted getting this item because I was afraid it would be too low and my dogs would try to eat out of it while I was getting the food ready.  I have 11 dogs at my home right now (some rescue) and 7 that live upstairs and are at my side when I am getting food ready.  I did not want to have a training battle when I an busy getting food ready.  However, I haven't had that problem and this has been much easier than dumping a 30-34 lbs bag of food in it (that will fill it up) than try to break the bag dog into smaller containers.
I love this container for dog food - have been looking for one of these and this one is perfect! You could easily pour a 55lb bag of dog food in this, but I just slide the whole bag in and it fits with room to spare. I left the wheels off because I dont ever need to roll the container. It is air tight to keep the food fresh and any bugs out, yet easily opens with a one-handed flip of the latch. The material is sturdy, including the lid, but I would not "drop" the bag of food in especially if you have the wheels attached as I can imagine that kind of sudden impact on the bottom might damage it. The sides are not see-through which doesnt matter since I can easily check on the food level when I feed my dog every day. I am brain storming to think of other uses for these containers and now looking at some of the smaller sizes for other uses too! Love it!
Cat food storage solution.IRIS Airtight Pet Food Storage Container, 11 Quart, GreenOur curious kitty decided that her food bag in an extra large ziplock to deter ants was something to chew on when bored.  Needed to keep bag intact and ants unable to smell food.  This does the trick.  Just poured the food inside the container and snapped the lid shut.  Kitty has knocked it over, but not opened it.  And it's easier to use then the ziplock was!  Plastic isn't flimsy and the flip snap latch is holding up well on the hinged lid.
I recently started baking bread using the no-knead recipe. The bread is scrumptious, and all my friends and neighbors love it -- which means I have to stock up on flour. Costco offers a great deal on organic artisan bread flour, but you have to buy a 25lbs bag. That's not an issue since I've been going through massive amounts of flour lately, but proper storage is an issue: these bags are heavy, fragile and can be leaky.The IRIS container offers perfect storage for this 25lbs bag, with room to spare on the sides -- I also store my yeast, scale and dough hook in there, and it provides an airtight seal. With its convenient wheels, it rolls away in the pantry and I can pull it out easily when I need it.
If I ever need another pet food container I will be purchasing this brand again! It's wonderful. Not only is it air tight, but the lid is very easy to open one-handed while you hold the dog food bowl in your other hand. I know that one complaint was that her cat knocked the storage container off the counter and it broke and all I can say is "Duhhhh, don't put the container on your counter." It should be on the floor in the pantry or elsewhere. It's very sturdy and holds an entire large bag of dog food. PERFECT!
We bought this container to store our dog food a year ago.  We looked at the big pet stores and the containers were way too expensive.  This was much cheaper and better quality than more expensive containers.  We can easily dump a whole 40lb bag of kibble in this bad boy with room to spare.  The seal works great.  The wheels work well but they do not snap in tight, so one of them falls off every time I lift it off the ground.  Not a big deal since I rarely need to carry it anywhere, but seems like a flaw they could fix.  This was a great purchase and we also bought a smaller one for our cat food which we are equally happy with.
This 11-12 quart container is exactly right for the size bags of cat food I buy--not the huge bags, but the eight pounders.  The profile is slim and unobtrusive and while I could wish it was sturdier, I think the unit will survive average domestic use.  The top locks securely, but isn't a nail breaker to get off; the latch just kind of rolls up.  The non-locking side is hinged which is nice for keeping everything together.I'm very pleased with this.  So, apparently, are the cats.
I use the 33 quart container to store 25-lb bags of organic whole wheat flour. I just lower the bag in gently and then close up the lid. It keeps the flour fresher longer, and makes it easy to shift around the kitchen to where I need it. I've never had a problem with it, and it has made my life so much easier.It worked so well, in fact, that I'm ordering another larger one to keep dog food in (which I guess is the original purpose) for our new dog!
I have these in an outdoor rubbermaid storage box. The IRIS Airtight Pet Food Container means I have double the protection for my 30 lb. bags of dry dog food. After years of use I've never had a problem with my dog food being kept safe from the elements. I do lock the outer storage box lid. I did not put the caster wheels on the container which makes it fit in the outdoor storage box perfectly. An awesome product that I recommend as perfect. I don't understand why others say that their dog food bags do not fit. I am buying standard dog food bags from Petco and there is still room enough to store what little is left of the last bag which is about empty.
I ordered two of these bins to hold rice and flour for my kitchen.  I ordered these specific bins because they were air (and critter) tight.  I didn't want to attract unwanted "guests" to my food supplies.  I was very happy with the sturdiness and weight of this product.  It Appears that it will suit my purpose well and I am totally pleased.  I was unsure of the size of the container as it pertains to my storage needs, so in case you want to know, this size bin holds 100 pounds of longrain white rice.  I think it will hold about 100 pounds of flour as well, but I have put only 50 in it so far.  The wheels are holding up well, contrary to some of the other reviewers experiences with these wheeled bins.
I purchased this as a storage container for my dry dog food. Unfortunately, when I removed it from the box, one of the wheels was already broken and the exterior of the container was scratched like it had been used for months prior to its arrival. I honestly would have been ok with the scratches but I had to send it back because I could not fix the wheel. I was apprehensive about buying another one online, so I didn't and instead I chose buy a different one from one of the big box stores in our area.
I use this one to hold salt so when it rains freezing rain or snow and it starts to freeze to ice, I can open this puppy up, use a small scoop and toss salt around. I use other models to store dog / cat food in my room so I can feed the pets without having to walk out to the garage to get a scoop of food. Plus I use the largest one to hold the dog food in the garage.I used to just open the bags and then try and scrunch them shut, but I noticed the food was drying out so I got one of these and now the food stays moist just like you opened it up right then.IRIS Airtight Pet Food Container, Navy Blue, 69 Quarts
I bought the 21-23qt for cat food and 45-47qt for dog food. The 21-23qt holds a 16lb bag of friskies just fine, and the 45-47qt almost holds a 44lb of dog chow with a little left over (especially since I tend to add a new one before the old is completely gone). But I have 3 dogs so the left over is usually gone within a day or two.It holds the smell in as well, as I haven't had any problems with any of the pets trying to eat their way through, and let me tell you my pets act like they haven't had a meal in years and WILL get into food.I love that the large 45-47qt has rollers so I can easily bring it to the dogs' bowls and fill them without breaking my back. Careful filling it with a 40+lb bag by yourself, as it tends to try to roll away!Perfect for my needs!
we got the 47-quart capacity container and it holds a 40 lb bag of dog food just perfectly. almost too perfectly...if you constantly buy 40 pound bags, maybe consider the next size up so you don't have to wait until the last minute to refill (because 40 pounds fits just right, you have to wait til its literally out of all food). so far it's been great for us, but in retrospect, i might have gotten the bigger one. great container though, lid opens easy, it holds up, locks freshness in, and keeps the dog food smell inside where it belongs.
I bought the IRIS pet food container because it's air tight and has wheels.  33 Quarts is good for the 17 pound bag of dog food we have.  The label says it can hold 25+ pounds of cat food, 26+ pounds of dog food, or 44+ pounds of bird seed.The wheels role smoothly, the lid fits snugly.  There's a latch on one side and a hinge on the other, so the lid stays attached and open when I'm scooping out food.  Works great.
These food containers are a great bargain and are airtight. They keep pet food fresh longer and bugs out. Unlike others, I do not dump my dog's food in these (I have two, one for Royal Canin and one for Bil-Jac). I put the entire bag in the container. This makes clean up and swapping out/refilling easier.I like the airtight handle and after almost a year of use, the first one I bought is still like new. The wheels make it easy to roll this in and out of other rooms. These containers do have a plastic smell that I tried to air out, but it's still there. It's not an unpleasant smell so it's not too bothersome--my lab still eats his food.This is a must have if you keep dog food and want it to stay fresh. 30-35lb. bags of dog food fit well in these.
We bought this because our cat liked to get into our other container. This container is well built and seems to be fairly adorable. The lid has a nice hinge on the rear of it and they Latcha on the front to keep everything tight and seal. On top of that inside of the lid is an O-ring that will match up against the whip of the container to keep the food fresh inside. This container fits a full bag of cat food with just enough room to put a little scooping cup in the top. Highly recommend this container.
I bought this 21-23 quart container for my dog's 35 lb. bag of dog food. A mathematician I am not. So, the food didn't fit, but I liked the container so much I wasn't about to send it back. It is now my new, and best, kitchen trash container. The seal is so strong, I can't smell a thing. Trash bags fit nicely and the container fits perfectly under the counter. If I had more room in my kitchen, I'd leave it out because it's cute and sleek. As for my dog's food, I bought the 30-33 quart IRIS (see review).
This is the perfect sized container for my dog's food.  I have a 15lb border terrier, and I buy a 13lb bag of food each time and can drop the whole thing in there (including the bag).  It's a perfect fit.  The lid seals the food up pretty good and it's easy to open and close.  I was skeptical at first when seeing how the latch was online, with the molded connectors on the back, but it's  pretty solid.
I needed an airtight storage container for my dog's food. I have a 100 lb Great Pyrenees, who eats Pro Plan Giant Breed formula. The largest size canister holds 1-34lb bag of kibble, with only a little room to spare. It would hold more if your dog eats smaller kibble. The Pro Plan Giant Breed is huge, and takes up more space. The airtight seal is great and the wheels were super easy to attach. It slides around the garage easily, even full of food. Still a great canister for dog food, no matter what size, although I would suggest a smaller canister if you have smaller pets so the food stays fresher. Overall, great purchase and I'm very happy with it.
I was iffy on buying this product because I didn't want to spend that much on a &#34;big tupperware container,&#34;  but it has proven to be worth every penny.  We have 2 large dogs so we wanted a dog food container that would hold a very large quantity of dog food (about 35 lb.) and keep it sealed from little critters so we could store it in the garage.  This does all that, plus it's very sturdy.  We recently moved to another state and I was almost expecting it to break in the process, but I was glad to be wrong.  We had to get the container out when we'd get to hotels and then load it back up for travel.  This held up without any cracks or breaks...or really any sign of wear at all.  Plus, the casters are great so you can store it under a table or something and pull it out easily even when it's full.
I was looking for a good, airtight dogfood container for my pet. This was the perfect solution. I bought the Airtight Food Container keeps Dry Pet Food Fresh 45-47 QT (Holds up to 35 # Dog / Cat food) - this is according to the Product Description.I buy Life's Abundance Premium Health Food for Puppies & Adult Dogs in a 40 lb. bag. The entire bag just barely fit into the bin, but it did fit. Also, when I put together the bin, I didn't put the wheels on it. Some reviewers said the wheels would occasionally break. Since I don't need to move the bin, I just didn't install them.The container has a nice seal, my dog can't knock it over and open it. (I have a pug that LOVES food.) My bag of food fits perfectly. I couldn't be more happy.
The specifications state (15 x 17.9 x 22.2 inches). With the wheels, it measures 24.25 in height. Of course it will not slide into my pantry at that height.Now I either place it outside in an unsightly plain-view position or drag it in and out of the pantry. I will bet in a few months that the unit breaks after pushing and pulling since the plastic is sort of brittle. The corners of the wheels are flimsy and not engineered well enough for the added stress of daily maneuvering where the wheels attach to the unit.Seriously, pass this if you are on the bubble of a decision.
This is a great storage bin for dog food.  We actually didn't pour out the food, in an effort to keep the container cleaner, but instead just put the opened bag inside.  It works very well.  This also allows us to keep a bag of treats inside too.  The container seals well and moves quite easily.  We only store a 20 lb bag of food inside and a small bag of treats, but there is plenty of room for more.  I would highly recommend this for anyone that needs to store a large bag of pet food.
I am a newbie at grooming two long haired cats that I adopted from the local shelter. They actually are pretty good about submitting to the clipper right up until it starts to heat up so I bought this product and it buys me some time while I groom them because it does cool the clipper head down. It does not make it cold, just cool but it works for a few minutes so that I can finish the area I was working on.  I also bought an extra clipper head (or maybe should be called clipper comb) but changing them takes two hands and my subject is long gone by then so this &#34;instant cool&#34; is a big help.
I've been grooming dogs for 35+ years & would never, ever be caught without Kool Lube!!  Great product, easy to use & is VERY HELPFUL!  It not only cools hot blades off, but removes hair quickly when you're in the middle of grooming a dog & don't want to take the blade off, take it apart to clean it!  Just spray Kool Lube along the top of the blade & thru the side, wipe off the excess & you're good to go!!  I love ALL Oster Products!
I shave my own cats because my cats are docile with me, but they try to kill any vet or groomer attempting to touch them. To minimize the stress on them and the emotional/physical trauma for the vets and the groomers, I shave them myself.I bought the Andis 21420 Pro-Animal Detachable Ceramic Blade Clipper Kit, which was fantastic, and I imagine a weebit cooler than the normal blades, but it still gets hot pretty quickly (10 minutes). Once it gets hot, you need a cooling spray like this (or at least a rubbing alcohol spray) to cool down the blades before you continue so your poor animals don't cry like you're trying to brand them.I attempted to shave them once before buying this, and immediately ordered this after that first attempt. It's a god send.
Worked great for three weeks then cat just stopped responding. Had to contact vet again and she put him on steroid eye drops to put in his nose. Problem solved. Kitten happy. Had to do the vet drops for one month. Now only use when he gets a sneezing fit and it is nipped before he gets sinus clog and infection.  Had multiple vets recommend useless remedies and medications. The drops are neomycin polymyxin and dexamethasone in ophthalmic suspension. It is manufactured by Sandoz and is prescription only. Comes in tiny bottle. It took three years three vets and over twelve hundred dollars spent before success. Hope this helps and saves you a thousand dollars.
I have been taking my one cat to the vet ever since I rescued him back in February.  I have spent over $1,000.00 on this cat and he still has an upper respiratory problem that won't go away.  This is the first time I have tried anything Homeopathic.  Well, I must say I am pleasantly surprised that my cat has not sneezed or coughed or anything since I started him on these drops.  It is a miracle!  True, my vet did give him some more Clavamox on the same day, but in all fairness, he has been on antibiotics at least 6 different times with no results.  I have to attribute my success to the Homeopet Nose Relief drops.
Based on the positive reviews, I purchased this product to deal with my cats sinus issues. His nose is constantly blocked up, he snores all the time and breathes through his mouth. He also has excessive nasal discharge. After bringing him to the veterinarian several times and putting him on a regimen of antibiotics, I decided to try out this product, as none of the other treatments provided any relief. While this product didn't make his condition any worse, it didn't do anything to make it better. I guess it all depends on your particular pet, but for mine the product was useless.
It really works. I use this on both a outside kitty colony and my own kitties. I put their dose on two cat treats and let it sit for about 5 minutes so the alcohol smell will go away and if they won't eat it I grate a little hard cheese and shape it into a ball around the medicated treats. So far, I've had no problems. If the kitty is too stuffed up to smell and eat the treats then I just grab them with the scruff of their neck open their mouth and put in their dose. So far I haven't had any kitties having a upset tummy. It does take a day or two to really see results. I give them their dose twice a day.
This ball is the typical Kong tough rubber, which is great.  My dog has been chewing on it quite a bit and it hasn't ripped or torn yet.  However, there are four bone-shaped holes in the ball, and one of them is significantly larger than the others.  Every treat I've put inside the ball comes out of that hole almost instantly.  I was hoping this would be more like the Kong, where I could put a treat in it and keep my dog entertained for a while trying to get it out, but that's not the case.  Still an ok purchase though for a tough ball that he can chew and not destroy.
I bought this to entertain my dog while she recovered from surgery.  When I first gave the ball to her, with Get Naked Dental Sticks protruding, the cat showed more than a passing interest.  So much so that I had to put the dog and ball into her crate to get away from the cat!My dog never was into balls or chasing them around, but she enjoys this one because of the treats.  But she wouldn't work that hard once the treat broke off and the rest remained in the ball.  After a few times of my intervening, with her watching, she'll now try (albeit unsuccessfully) to get the rest of the treat out herself.  Today, she actually chewed on the ball for some 10 minutes trying to get at the treat.  Maybe she'll get better at this as time goes on.
Seemingly indestructible for my 80 pound pup!  The only thing I wish I had known was to buy larger sized dog biscuits to fill the grooves, as all the treats I currently have fall out immediately from the large openings surrounding the ball.  They are great, by the way, for her to grab hold to during a game of fetch or retrieve.  I have taken to filling the ball with her kibble after wetting it, mixing in a few treats/dog biscuits, and then freezing it overnight.  This slows down her ability to extract the treats, and gives her a bit more to &#34;work&#34; on before she settles down for a nap.  Next time I order from Amazon, I will get some extra large biscuits for Kong products to put in the grooves, but until then, she is enjoying her kongsicle.
First of all, I love the kong toys. They are durable, they last, and my dog enjoys eating the treats inside. We have the regular kong ball w/ the small hole in the end and she loved that so I decided to buy this one too. I bought treats shaped like biscuits to go inside the biscuit ball but found that there was still alot of space/room inside this ball-even though it was the smaller size. Our dog had no problems getting the biscuit out which is a problem since she's eating a larger treat and spent no little time playing with the ball to get to the treat.  I give it a 3 because I love the kong products but didn't like this particular design.
My Foster pit bull can literally destroy any toy in a Mayer of seconds. Even all other kong toys are no match for this. The funny thing is that he and I were out for a walk one day and we found this laying on some grass by the side of the road. He had not been able to make a dent in this thing and carries it around with him every where he goes. I will definitely be sending it worth him when he goes to his furever home, and I will be sure to tell them what a great price it sells for here.
After reading the instructions, keeping it rinse with regular water after use and discarding the first test each time I use it my readings still will not go past 1.016! This is even after adding more salt to the aquarium to bring it up to the 1.025 I need. Now I have no way of know what my salinity is until I purchase a refractometer for more accurate results which also puts a delay on me adding any inhabitants to the tank.I even gave it a second chance, I actually purchased saltwater from my local fish store which is pre-mixed at a salinity of 1.025. When I did a test on it...still got 1.016. Needless to say I will be throwing this item away.
keep it clean and i would say it works  if rite from factory. I have.  deep 6 hydrometers  that are 15 years old maybe older that still work well.  That's 5 star in my book as long as its accurate when new  keep it clean with fresh water and look close for air bubbles ...i have had 4 Instant Ocean SeaTest Hydrometer that the counter weight fell out with no way to fix  and 3 instant ocean testers that didn't work at all  ThoseFishGeeks. comCounter weight falls out
There are mixed feelings about using a hydrometer to measure specific gravity of the water. but there are some ways to keep on getting accurate readings. one is , pour water in slowly, make sure all the fresh water is out so measure the first time and then dump it and measure again. Normally that gives the more accurate reading.  and always make sure there is no bubbles on the measuring unit. bubbles can greatly affect the reading.  Definitely a lot cheaper than a refractometer. I will get one later but for now this will do, since im just starting.
I'm using this to measure low salinity in brackish tanks and for salt ich treatments. One thing to remember....the directions say rinse Before and After....BUT when you rinse it in tap water, there are many drops of fresh water still in the instrument...if you dip it in tank water and take a measure, you will get a LOW reading....so dump that first sample after a minute or so...Then dip Another sample and you will have an accurate reading every time. This is a very good hydrometer for the money. Many buy expensive refractometers or resistive types which can also deceive you for a number of reasons.
I happen to live near the ocean,, so I have the luxury of testing it against a control system.  I took several samples of ocean water at various depths and away from shore to see what the actualy salinity was.  Then I made a mark on it to set the salinity of my fish tank.. (.038) anyway,,  I live in the south pacific in the marshall islands..  It seems a little high,, so either the gauge is slightly wrong or the water has more salt than what wikipedia says it should be for the tropics.
I had an oceanic hydrometer for nano tanks that was meant to stay in the tank at all times (it had little suction cups on it so it was always facing the outside of the tank. I was getting high readings from it all the time, even when i would mix the appropriate salt/water mix stated in the directions to achieve a specific gravity of 1.024. I thought the hydrometer was off, so I ordered this one. I use a lot of Instant ocean products and expected this to be of the same quality of their other products. It consistently reads low salt content, while the other one i have reads high. I literally mixed a gallon of water with 1/2 cup salt so i knew that the salinity would be 1.024, and marked with a pen where 1.024 was, not where it said it was. I am disappointed and am buying a refractometer instead of another hydrometer. The ones that are both a hydrometer and thermometer are a joke too ... don't waste your time on those either.
I have had this product only a week but I must say I am really impressed with its performance. I have counted 8 feral cats in my yard catching and eating birds around my feeders. I tried everything I could think of to discourage them and nothing worked. I saw this product and decided to try it and thought I would have to wait to see results because of the reviews I read. The first day I saw 3 cats enter the area and strongly react and immediately leave the area. The second day more were repelled. The cats really hate the sound and leave quickly. I have twice as many birds as I did before and no cats in only one week. No, it doesn't chase the birds away at all! Don't use batteries, use the power adapter and get a lot less hassle. Great product so far. I may order another one.
So far, pretty good on keeping the neighbor's cat away.  I have heard him close by but then he seems to disappear which I hope is about the cat alarm "going off."  I'm using 3 of the devices, 2 in the back of our house and 1 by front door.  Having a cat spray your front door is totally disgusting.  It annoys me that neighbors think it's OK to let their cat run our neighborhood,  my 3 cats are totally indoors and happy.  The issue is I have two males and the neighborhood cat is also that.  Talking to the neighbors about the problem did not work but we think the CatStop is doing the trick.  I secure the device in a flower pot filled with dirt.  That way it's been easy to relocate as I find what works best.
Boy does this work! We tried it out first to make sure it's not going to actually harm the cats. It's just like getting static shock. We accidentally step on it often when we put it in front of the kitchen and it's really not that big of a deal... Well, the cats don't get ontop of the recliner or go into the kitchen anymore... It just takes a time or two and the cats learn that they want nothing to do with it. I want to buy one more that fits in front of my tv to keep the kitty nose prints off of it.
Awesome, great tasting vitamin C chewables! The berry tastes awesome & these are easy on the stomach.Vitamin C is essential to wound-hearing & prevention of long-term, chronic pain problems down the road. It can also help if you already have pain issues.IMHO, everyone who has had surgery or an injury to a limb, I'd take 3,000-5,000mg/day for roughly 6 weeks, then taper down to a regular every day dose. My chiropractor gave me an article from a chiropractic journal on the prevention of CRPS/RSD after surgery & injury to limbs, and a good vitamin C supplement reduces the chance by roughly 6-fold of developing RSD or CRPS.In addition, we all know that vitamin C has other antioxidant properties & thus health benefits.These taste like a tart candy (very much like sour sweet tarts!)For those who can't take citrus, yet need a vitamin C supplement, these are a great solution!For those of us who don't, they really taste great!
This is the chewable vitamin C I use the most, and this is my favorite flavor of the Natural Factors brand. It comes in convenient 500 mg. tablets. I like to keep several bottles of these on hand at all times. If I begin to get a cold or flu, taking extra vitamin C helps prevent it worsening.These are the ingredients listed on the label:"Dextrose, fructose, cellulose, peach, passionfruit & mango flavors, magnesium stearate (vegetable grade), citric acid, natural color, citrus bioflavonoids, hesperidin bioflavonoids, rosehips powder, rutin, silica. Contains no artificial color or sweeteners; no yeast."There are 10 calories per tablet, basically from the sweetener which makes the chewable C more palatable.
Okay so these Vitamin C wafers are delicious! A great way to boost your immune system. They help me get over a cold and relieve scratchy sore throats. My only complaint, and it's not really a major complaint, is that when I bought the Blueberry, Raspberry, Boysenberry flavor I was expecting there to actually be 3 flavors in the bottle. As it turns out there is only one flavor and it is a MIXTURE of Blueberry, Raspberry and Boysenberry. The flavor is good, mind you, but still I would have preferred there to be three separate flavors in one bottle.
I have two yappy pomeranian dogs.  The larger one periodically wears the Premier Gentle Spray Anti-Bark Dog Collar (available from Amazon for approx $45).  It works wonderfully but it's only recommended for dogs over 6 lbs.  So I bought the Lentek to control barking in the smaller dog.I've had it for two months now and still use it, but it only works minimally.  The dogs sometimes pause a bit when it's triggered, but most of the time they just continue barking.I guess the Lentek's better than nothing, but I wouldn't buy it again.  Instead, if your dog is over 6 lbs, I would buy the citronella collar.
This did not work at all on my 2 small dogs.  After I installed it right near their favorite window to bark at they stopped barking until it stopped making the noise but after repeating this a couple times they became immune to the noise and ignore it completely.  Besides not working the other thing I did not like about this was the power cord.  My fault for not reading the description close enough but I figured a product like this would probably be battery operated but it only runs using a power cord to an electrical outlet.
Although the reviews were mixed, I was really, really hoping this was going to work for me since I live in an apartment and I am the only tenant with a dog.  My dog's barking is driving me crazy and I'm sure it's annoying my neighbors as well.  Anyway, the Lentek arrived today and I plugged it in immediately.  The noise emitted did cause my dog to stop barking BUT the device is so sensitive that the noise was being sent out whether my dog was barking or not. I know this because I initially had it set on &#34;audible&#34; to make sure it would be activated when my dog barked.  (It was set on &#34;low&#34; sensitivity.) I don't see how this could be effective if the alarm is going off non-stop even when my dog is not barking... how is that going to train him not to bark?  I'll be returning this ASAP.
Unbeknownst to me (at first), my dog was barking during the day while in its crate. She'd stop barking whenever I came home, so naturally I was clueless.But my neighbor mentioned her (my dog's) barking for &#34;hours&#34; after I went to work in the morning, and my roommate said my dog did make a fuss until she fell asleep eventually... so I looked for something to reduce her noise level until she grew enough out of her puppy state so I could let her roam more freely when I was at work.This thing worked like a charm the first time I plugged it in. In fact, my roommate was home sick that day and when I asked her how the dog had done, she said in surprise, &#34;I thought you took her with you!&#34;So, it worked for me, but I know these remedies don't always work for everyone.My next trick with it will be to turn it to face our other neighbors and their dogs... :)
I always order Purina Pro Plan cat food from Amazon, as with Amazon Prime I receive prompt two day service with no shipping cost.  I am handicapped and cannot get out to shop and this is a tremendous asset to me!!HOWEVER, this order was shipped incorrectly....instead of one "Salmon" and 1 "Chicken", I received two bags of "Chicken with Rice". As it is too difficult for me to return one, can you send 1 "Salmon" at N/C or a reduced rate to compensate for the inconvenience
My dog prefers not to have anything on her head, but she tolerates it. The doggle straps on pretty firmly. And the material is nice and soft. As long as she does not shake her head very hard it stays on. On sunny days she does not mind much, but if it is cloudy she does not like it. Maybe it is too dark for her.But boy is she a star in this doggle! People on the street praise her all the time when she wears it on walks. I bet she knew it too - she always waggles her butt more and puts on a cool face while wearing it.
LOVE these glasses!  They are high quality and have the chin strap to hold them on!  LOVE these glasses- and my Boston Terrier leaves them on!He got so much attention at the local festival.Ordered the small for my 9 pound puppy - he could have easily worn an XSOrdered the medium for my 33-35 pound large Boston - FITS HIM PERFECTLY.Ordered the XL for the 100 pound pit bull that I was keeping.  They were too large.  He could have easily worn the Large.  :-)Hope this helps!OVERALL, GREAT product!!! Will order again in more colors!! A+++
These dog goggles are well worth the money, quality construction as well as materials used. I would recommend them for every dog that loves to stick their head out the car window, we think our dog got an eye infection doing so. Something flew in her eye, if she had on her dog goggles that wouldn't have happened. The size is spot on, we have a goldendoodle who weighs 80 pounds and the large fits her face perfect. It is adjustable both top and bottom chin strap.It took a while for her to keep them on, but she knows now that if we go car riding she has to have them on, we used treats at first. She looks so cute and fashionable, we feel better knowing her eyes are protected.
Charlie, our maltese/pomeranian mix is happiest when in the car with his head out the window. I got these googles to protect his eyes from the wind and debris.  We've got great pictures of him in the goggles, but they have to be snapped very quickly because he won't keep the goggles on for more than about thirty seconds.  I'm not sure if anything can be done about this in terms of product design.  But unless your dog is completely docile, this will likely be a wasted purchase.
These are nice and the red is really bright.  Just not what I was looking for.  I have a black lab mix and these just made his face seem bigger.  I went with the blacks and it seems to blend in a lot better.  They fit great too.  Only thing I do not like about them is they tend to get really loose quickly.  I mean I took my dog for a ride down the block and they had gotten loose on him.  And they don't fit just right no him either.  He has one ear that goes up and one that is down and these tend to make the googles crooked for some reason.  And when they get too crooked he gets uncomfortable with them on.  So, keep this in mind when purchasing these.  This item kind of rest on how the dogs ears are, they do factor in.
Size is so important here! I bought two sizes just to be sure: the medium and the large. The Medium fit my 50 lb Catahoula perfectly, and while the large fits him, it looks a little glam with the oversized lenses. Worth noting is that these are not so much a fashion luxury as a necessary item when taking one's pup out into the sunny elements. Our pooch sails with us, and I was happy to see I could get shatterproof, UV-blocking, polarized lenses just like mine but for him to wear. I don't want my dog's eyesight to fail early just because I didn't take precautions for the effects of water glare on his eyes (don't forget, dogs didn't evolve to have to deal with water glare, just as humans didn't--that's why we've got to wear eye protection in the first place). Bonus: these are super-cute on any dog!
I got these for my dog... really as more because i thought they looked funny and would be cute when he rides in my bike basket. They fit him great and he actually likes them. They are a decent price and work well even when he is riding on sunny days with his head out the window. Note though, he only likes wearing them when he is riding in the car or in the bike basket, if he is walking on the ground, he tries to rub them on the cement and it could scratch them. the little chin strap is a great help in keeping him comfortable and getting the glasses to stay on.
I used these until we could get our 1 year Norwich Terrier into &#34;cataract surgery, he had juvenile cataracts. If you are a dog owner please take some time to teach your dog to wear these excellent eye protective glasses!!  If your dog rides in a car with his head outside the window or in any situation where debris can hit him in the eye these are excellent to be worn. It will not take much to train your dog to keep the on their face and you will protect the precious gift of &#34;eyesight&#34; for your pet.
This sunglasses are awesome! My dogs do not love wearing them, but will when given treats and are slowly warming up to wearing them often. Eye disease is common in older dogs so the sooner you start protecting the more likely your dogs can avoid it. Not to mention my dogs look incredible cute in these. They are well made and seem comfortable when adjusted the correct way. Just make sure to reward your dog for wearing them and begin in small increments. Love them and would absolutely recommend for everyone's whose dog spends time out in the sun or at the beach.
My pup goes with me most everywhere and I wear sunglasses to protect my eyes, so I wanted the same for him.  Doggles fit him perfectly.  I measured him twice before ordering to make sure the fit would be correct.  The lenses are orange and brighten everything up while deflecting UV rays.  They weren't bought with a cute factor as the main objective however they are cute.  Super cute. Everyone who has seen him wearing them loves them. To get him used to wearing them I put the doggles on him several times a day, a few minutes at a time, for about a week.  He still tries to take them off every once in a while but he is adjusting to them.  For the most part they stay on him as long as he isn't trying to take them off.  Very happy with doggles.
I purchased this system for my pitbull puppy. She loves to visit the neighbors and I didn't always want her bothering them, or eventually wandering into the road. She has been shocked twice by it (once in the back yard and one in the front), and she has never even tried to cross the line again. When she hears the beep she immediatly turns back. She learned very quickly where her line is. I love that you can adjust it to make the range bigger or smaller. It is perfect if I ever have to bring her to someone's house to be watched. The fence goes with her. I feel very safe letting her out now.
I live in a split level house which already causes an issue with where to place this thing.  Got it setup how the instructions said and went to setting the perimeter flags, came to find out that it would have been the most ridiculous perimeter for the dogs to run in.  Come to find out that the unit does a horrible job with terrain changes.  Half of my yard dips down about two feet in the back for landscaping and the front of my house dips about four feet to be level with the road.  Basically this causes a huge issue with this system getting a decent bubble.  Basically i have to resort to getting a fence.
We have had this system for quite a while and it started off great, over time the transmitter died and we had to get a replacement, now they collars don't work! We have 2 dogs and one of the collars is extremely sensitive and won't the let dog move far from the transmitter and the other can go where ever he wants! The batteries are new btw. I just went to call the dogs inside and had to search for one of them until I finally found him wayyyyy outside his range! We will be using this system for quick trips with the dogs to my parents house, but will still need to watch them. We are upgrading to the dogwatch underground system.
We started using this product when our lab puppy started following the neighbors dog off.  He (a chocolate lab) age 3 months at time of use, learned quickly where his boundaries were.  My folks had one for their chocolate lab as well and I knew they loved their fence so we got one for ours. Only wish it could also be used with a remote as well, so when I catch him chasing my cats, or in my flower bed I could correct him.  Strongly recommend these type of fences,  little work involved, really didn't take much to &#34;train&#34; our dog, he got the point pretty quickly, even when set on a low frequency,  did have to turn it up a notch when he started following my son through the boundary to the neighbors, but he got the message quick.
I have two Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, my sister who has an enormous yard, has two Maltese. She installed this system mostly for my pups so they could play outside when I was forced to travel.  Training went great for her two and for my ruby-Gypsy.  They yard kept them contained and there were no issues, no one like being zapped.However this did last very long, Barkley - the black and tan, soon learned he could stand just within the warning zone of the beep till the battery ran down.  Then he could safely exit.  I watched him do this, so did his "friends".  Now this rather expensive fence and set of four collars is worthless.So, I would evaluate your dog's intelligence/ stubbornness before making this purchase.
I was skeptical that a wireless containment system was what I needed to keep my 7 month old lab contained.  After talking to other dog owners, I ordered the Petsafe Wireless Pet Containment System PIF-300.  It took about 1/2 hour to find the proper setting and flag the boundaries.  My puppy immediately learned the consequences of leaving the yard.  She now shies from 5 feet from the flags.  It's been 3 weeks and I'm about ready to pull the warning flags.  This system is totally worth the price!  Easy to set up, easy to change the shock levels and very easy to train a stubborn pup!  I would recommend this to anyone!
If your dog is already trained for the underground fence, this will be super easy. In fact, before you even get this, just put the flags out. We did that before plugging it in and the flags were all we needed!WARNING #1: Test the collar BEFORE putting it on your dog. The settings can be much closer in than you think.WARNING #2: Remove the collar when taking your dog out of the yard as other systems can set it off.This was SIMPLE to install & would be easy to transfer to another location. All you need is an electric outlet to plug the unit into. Once your dog learns the boundary flags you should be able to set up the flags anywhere and you dog should know. Otherwise he will get a beep warning before he goes too far.If your dog is not familiar with the system, he probably will get out once, but that should be the first and last time he does!
We looked into electric fences for our dog but didn't want to have to rip up our driveway and install wire underground. We came across this device and went with it. Great product. Setup was easy and our dog picked up on the lines location very quickly. Batteries last about 2-3 months which is okay and you have to remember to reset it if the power goes out but other than that no real cons.As a bonus we can easily pack the whole system up and take it with us camping or to our relatives house for a quick and easy fence solution. Our friends got the same system for their dogs and now we can just bring our dog over with his collar and they all stay in the yard. I highly recommend this product.
I finally sold it. It does work but the batteries go very quick. Ne problem with this is since it provides a circular perimeter, we had to put a very small range as keeping a wider range made it not to work where our neighbors houses were. Looks like the circle ends up somewhere in their house and our dogs figured that out and would take off in that direction. Going for an in-ground wired fence as i can control the area i want. Good for large houses maybe with tons of room between the neighboring houses.
I am using the Aquaclear 50 for my 20 gallon tall planted tank. This new version includes biomedia in place of the Ammonia granules. This design has been in place for decades and after several types of tanks with various filters, i chose the aquaclear on my latest for both simplicity and reliability. The planted tank requirements are somewhat different to a fish tank however maintain clean water conditions and beneficial bacteria are largely the same.The biggest benefit is the freedom to make your own media using filter bags. A+The price on Amazon is also several dollars cheaper than the LFS so why go anywhere else :)
This was great, until it wasn't.  Even though I had the problems with the noisy impeller, after I put a little vasoline on it it stopped the noise.  Everything was fine until I came home today to do my weekly maintenance and the filter was dead!  I know it was working last week when I did a water change but I have no idea when it quit working.  Fortunately I have two filters running so my fish are ok. This filter only lasted six months so I'm very disappointed.
I've had a few other common types of power filters and I believe this one is superior simply because you can more easily layer filter media of your choosing into the device without hassle.  It can be difficult to use batting or custom cut filters on the type where the filters sit vertically (looking down at the filter shows narrow edge of filter square) but on this unit they sit flat and water comes up from below.  A handful of the heavy Biolocal Filtration cylinders that come with the filter will hold down other layers.  I don't like to use Carbon b/c we have a lot of plants and this filter allows me to easily cut and use my own filter mesh.Also, flow rate is very good and somewhat adjustable on this unit.
I use this for my 45-50 Gallon Jack Dempsey tank.Pros:It's &#34;quiet&#34; - you will hear the water flow but it's not loudDoes a great job of keeping the water clearGreat filtering media - one layer of sponge, standard carbon filter, and BioMaxI think it's a good deal price wise (a 10 gallon filter normally $15, so if you calculate, the price is about right)It's a BIG filter, but it's not ugly - it has a blue/clear color, sleek designYou can adjust water flow (I don't notice a difference adjusting it though)Cons:I wish they could have made the filter a little longer - my Jack is a bottom-dweller, so most debris on the bottom
This filter runs much better and quieter than the one that came with the tank.  It also keeps running.  Our tank was really &#34;unclear&#34; for a while, but this filter kept chugging along without slowing down.  It's extremely easy to clean.  The only reason it dropped a star in my opinion is that the dip tube doesn't come off easily, and the connection to join the tube makes it hard to manipulate the dip tube off the filter when cleaning it.  I can see eventually breaking the dip tube.EXCELLENT customer service though.  Mine was missing the little adjustable spacer deal at the bottom to level it to the tank.  I emailed them, and within a day, they mailed me one.  I had a few days later.  I used part of the cardboard box folded up to level it until it arrived.  No biggie.
I purchased this filter in the fall of 2010. It is now 3 years old. It is a reliable powerhorse for my 10-gal aquarium. And it is quiet. Very quiet. The current list price is $30, so I'm now averaging $10/yr out of this thing. For what it does, and for the fact that it is constantly at work 24/7, I couldnt ask for a better product.Some people on here say not to waste time with the carbon filter. I think that is lousy advice - the water is crystal clear when new carbon is introduced - so I think changing it every two months is a good idea. I do not see any need to EVER change the biomax filter.. I've had mine since I bought it. You can get 3-4 months out of each sponge, just rinse it off with every cleaning, and the gunk comes right off.
I have bought two of these after trying two other brands.  This unit has three advantages over the two others.  First, it is very easy to lift the tray to clean or replace the filter media.  Second, it is very quiet as long as you keep the water level high enough so the water doesn't have to drop a lot to the water's surface.  Third, it is safe in that it can not auto-siphen all of your aquarium water onto your floor if the seal fails...this has actually happened to me with a below-the-tank unit.
So far its good I recevied THREE replacement from AMAZON due to POOR packaging and POOR courier handling ONTRAC sucks, but thats beside the point if your AQ110 is sent packaged correctly and arrives in one peace assembly is easy provided you follow the included instructions unlike some reviews out there the plastic material the AQ is made out of is sturdy the included media is a bonus (just rinse very well) flow output is great and YOU CAN see the difference when flow rate is adjusted its not a HUGE difference, but noticeable set it up yesterday 6/13/2013 and its been running flawlessly all night no leaks or overflow problems. Priming was easy and fast lets hope it continues working fine.
The aquaclear is:- Quiet- Flows a ton of water- Cheap to maintain/use- Designed very nicelyIt doesnt make any noise at all, its seriously that quiet. This Aquaclear 110 flows 500 gallons of water per hour on the high setting. That is a lot of water thru a filter which means more turnover and more stuff being pulled out of the water. This filter is cheap to maintain as the sponge block is reusable, unlike other filters when the pad fills up you toss it. This filter you can just rinse out the sponge and its ready to go again in a few mins.A great filter for your main tank or even a nice setup for a Quarantine Tank....
I picked this up for my brackish 46 gallon tank.  I liked it because I could replace the media with bulk media (using a drawstring mesh bag). It's a little overkill for this setup, but it keeps the water super clean.  I've got 3 puffers and a load of guppies in there and 0 nitro, 0 nitra, and 0 ammonia.  Water changes every 2-3 weeks and no issues.  I had a puffer die and when I took it to the store, they were confounded on how clean the water was.
This filter is truly amazing. This is my second filter that I've bought only to add it to my new 75 gallon tank. It worked amazingly in my 29 gallon tall. My water was always crystal clear as long as i did my normal weekly water changes. I love that you can customise how you want to filter your water. I personally do a sponge on bottom, bio media in middle and another sponge on top. I have not yet replaced any of the supplies that they give you because I dont believe they need to be replaced at their reccomended time frame. My aquarium is always crytal clear and my fish love it too. Great filter. Would reccomend to anyone for H.O.B. filter.
This is 2nd one bought to be used as a backup filter for my 60 gallon tank, so I do recommend buying one. It works well to complement my Rena xP3. Very quiet as in the motor, gives the water flow sound, which is good for some people, myself included. Because my tank have live plants, sand substrate and cichlids, the filter does get clogged a lot.  Have to clean it biweekly. Love buying it via Amazon, fast delivery and cheaper than everyone else on this particular item!
I did a lot of research on filters before I purchased this and had considered a number of different brands before deciding on this one.  The driver of my decision was that this filter is small and has an adjustable flow rate which you sometimes don't get on smaller filters.  More importantly I like that the filter is customizable and allows you to configure the media any way you want.  You can add charcoal, foam, biomax, or some other item of your choice.  I'm running it with the foam sponge and some seachem matrix which is working well.  It seems easy to clean and is very quiet.  I would highly recommend it especially for planted aquariums due to how you can customize it.
this may not be the most powerful filter in the market but it really does an excellent job. i bought this for a small tank for my fish in my pond so that they can be indoor during the winter. the water is always crystal clear and doesn't stink. just make sure you always clean the foam filter and the propeller of the pump as it always have a lot of waste in it. if you can, make an extension of the pipe down to the bottom as this only includes one extension. you can buy a flexible pipe with the same diameter in your hardware store. the sound created by the waterfall largely depends on the height of the water in the tank. less water in the tank means more splashing sound. i just use the flow control during feeding time so that the food will not be sucked in to the pump other wise it is better to keep it fully open for optimized filtration, "natural" waterfall look and sound.
I have this and the Fluval C4 in a 55gal tank and I must say I like them both. However, I give a slight edge to the Fluval only because I like the way the media is stored. The Fluval's media is stored in individual vertical cartridges whereas the AquaClear's media is layered on top of each other. When it's time for cleaning or changing media, the Fluval is just more convenient. I think there both good filters. Watch some video reviews on both if you're not sure. Heck, one reviewer even compares the 2 filters. I don't think you can go wrong with either one. Just my 2.
I love the filter. I have six freshwater aquaria and each has an Aquaclear filter. Just don't be tempted to save a few dollars and order from warehouse deals. It was missing media, missing parts, and the parts that were there were broken.  Of course, Amazon, being the great company that it is, handled it - refunded my money and scheduled a pick up. All I had to do was put it back in the box and put it out for UPS.This is the fourth time I have made a purchase from warehouse deals. Their packing is terrible and everything has arrived broken. From Amazon direct or one of their many sellers I have never had anything but perfection!!
I am usually a diehard canister filter user for my aquariums, but when setting up a couple of small tanks at home (a 6 gallon salt and a 8 gallon fresh), I wanted to try a power filter again.  While I used to use power filters when I first started in the hobby about 12 years ago, I moved to canisters due to their versatility and ability to handle a larger bio-load.  The appeal of the AquaClears was that they were reputed to be quiet, as well as have some versatility in their media capacity.  They are well-reviewed on aquarist sites such as planted tank.net and others, so I thought I'd give them a try.  After a few months, I'm very satisfied.  While I still want canisters for my heavier-stocked tanks, they AquaClears have worked well, and they are very affordable.  A recommended product.
The AquaClear line has been available for many years. You can't beat them for dependability, ease of maintenance and low operating cost. I have kept fresh and salt tanks for over 30 years and I always go back to the Aquaclear power filters.I have tried many different types including canisters, wet-dry, but IMO these filters are so easy to keep which means you will do your required maintenance instead of neglecting it, plus if you purchase your own media bags, you can save a lot of $$$ buying your media in bulk. The included foam filter lasts forever, & of course the included ceramic bio-rings just need to be rinsed as needed in a container of your tank water when necessary. The only outlay would be for carbon or whatever media you wish to utilize.I would recommend to my friends.
Just changed from cartridge-based Aqueon filter--never made sense to me why anyone would completely remove good bacteria from a filter.  This simply makes much more sense to have semi-permanent biological media to keep the filter and tank healthy.That said, I'm used to my Fluval 406 cannister filter and was curious as to why AquaClear/Fluval/Hagen did not employ some sort of modular media baskets for this as they do in their cannisters.  No big deal as it's fairly compact, but would make changes easier.  I would also say that the plastic case looks cheap.  Not sure if Fluval changed this materially with their new version.Anyway, great product that does the job for a good price.  Can't complain too much.
It is a common mod online to make this a refugium and after a little epoxy I can see why.  This filter has a very large space for mechanical filtration, chemical filtration, macro algae, live rock, a sand bed, and a heater. The flow is a bit much for a 10 gallon SW tank so you will either need to build a diverted for the front out of plexi or replace the impeller with the 30 model.As a regular filter it seems like it would work well but as far as changing the cartridges it looks a little more difficult then on a bio-wheel type model.  This model is quieter than my bio-wheel-type filter (similar size) and based on appearances you get more filtration with this (larger amounts of media).
I needed to upgrade to a larger power filter (I upgraded to a larger aquarium).  I was using the Aquaclear 50.  The Aquaclear 50 did a great job and it was very quiet.  The Aquaclear 70 does a great job too, but it is very loud.  Almost too loud.  I can take the lid off and it helps, but the noise is coming from the filter motor.  It is not a vibration noise. I already exchanged it for another one because I thought the loudness was a defect.  I was wrong.  If you have your aquarium in a family room where you spend alot of time, this power filter is too loud.
This (Aquaclear 20) is also the same filter included with Fluval Edge tank, and is very quiet and does it job cleaning the tank.I bought AC20 for my hospital tank and cleans it as it should.What I like about aquaclears compared to other hang on the back filters, is that you don't need to keep on buying filter cartridges. The included foam and ceramic filter should last you a couple of years. Just wash them gently form the water from your tank, or water treated with antichlorine stuff, to preserve the beneficial bacteria.Enough said, highly recommended!
Now that I have had this for 18 months or more I'm very happy I spend less money and less time on my aquarium in keeping it clean I usually receive complements on its clarity from visiters. I pull the basket every week to 10 days and clean and put back takes 5 minutes. About every 2 or 3 months I remove and clean the whole filter inside all the plastic parts easy to remove and clean  this maybe takes 20 minutes.  Only other thing is bottom cleaning and sponge the glass on the inside every couple a weeks after cleaning bottom and sides stirring up po this filter clears  up my 50 gallon tank in an hour or two. I use a lower power light and this keeps algea way down takes a couple a weeks to notice any. This is with four large goldfish and they are about 10 inches large and poo factories.  Highly recommend this Aquaclear filter
This filter is like a hit-or-miss. It's very loud, I can't believe people who said it's quiet. I had the filter for 2 months with my aquatic turtle tank, and it's still have a strong flow. The big complain I have is when I cleaned the filter and it needs to pump up water into the filter. It's tricky when you control the water flow knob, you've to make it just right, in order to have the water pumped up and working. Also the filter gets very dirty after one week. I've to clean it every week, maybe it's because turtles poop alot. Cleaning is easy, only setting it up is hit-or-miss.
We used to use the AquaClear filters, and when we just re-entered the world of fishkeeping, we purchased a different brand for our larger tank.  What a terrible waste.  It is a failure and we really regret not getting an AquaClear.  We purchased the AquaClear 20 for my daughter's 10 gallon.  It has worked like a charm and the tank is very very clear.  We did have a bout of ich and I had to remove the carbon while medicating.  This caused the filter to not perform as well as it should have because there was not enough media in the chamber.  If you have this situation, I suggest getting an extra sponge so that there is something in the carbon's place.  As long as all of the media chambers are full, this works like a charm.
Although I've only had this filter up and running for almost a week, I already notice a difference in my turtle's water quality. It's in a 35 gallon long, but only filled to around 20 gallons. I love the option of being able to reduce the water flow during feeding time, and while it's a noisy waterfall, the pump itself runs quietly without vibration. I already want to replace all my filters with these AquaClear Power filters. It's simple, sturdy, easy to set up and clean, and who can beat the lifetime guarantee, all for just around $30! Five stars! I'm thinking I'll never buy another brand of filter again!
I use this in my 10 gallon tank. The tank had snails and a ghost shrimp and a mosquito fish. It now also holds a Betta. The main problem I have with the filter is that it started growing things in the tube that soaks up water very shortly after installing it. The tank is pretty clean, but that's most likely due to the snails. The current produced by the water fall is nice and relatively quiet. I took it apart this weekend and cleaned it thoroughly, but after putting it back together it wouldn't work. I'm not sure but I had to fiddle with it for awhile to get the motor to start back up again. It serves its purpose, but I'm not amazed by it.
I've had Aqua Clear filters for a long time. They seem to last and last. When I set up my tank again, I still had a filter that was probably 20 years old, still worked but I wasn't sure I could find filters to fit.So I bought a new one. It does a great job, has layered filtering (foam, charcoal and biomax), it has an adjustable flow control and a spacer at the back to make sure it sits at the right angle to flow properly in your tank.I've never had a fish stuck at the intake and the pump seems indestructible. Easy enough to take off and clean. Just don't run the filter dry or it will burn it out.
I was using the terrible Whisper filters, which kept breaking on me. Now, I'm extremely impressed by my AquaClear, which has been going strong for 8 months so far. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for money-efficient filtration.PROS:-Easy to clean filter intake tubes, filter tank, and sponge WITHOUT decreasing beneficial bacteria-See-through plastic makes it easier to know when maintenance/cleaning is needed-Breaks surface tension-Easy setup-Hang On Back is cheaper than other filtration systems of the same power-Peace and quiet!CONS:- Like people say, it DOES vibrate a little but this can be ELIMINATED by pressing the adjustment lever in a non-noisy, up or down direction. This does not alter the filter power, since the filtration rate is adjusted by horizontal adjustments only. (So really, there are no cons.)
Don't waste your time with all these other HOB filters, if you are going to get a HOB then get an AquaClear. They are the best but you already know that if you are looking at this.My 3 favorite things about them, First you can put any Media you want in here, remove the Carbon (unlike some filters out there) they come with BioMax already - GREAT STUFF, Second you can just wash the Filter media (USE OLD TANK WATER ONLY IF YOU MUST CLEAN THE FILTER, Third you can swap the impellers so for instance you can put a AquaClear 70 filter on your 20G tank and just put a smaller impeller from the 20 model in!
I've been using these for years. The last one lasted over 10 years before it started making noise. I expected the new one to be as quiet as a mouse, just as the old one was when I first installed it.However this one is even noisier than the old one. I threw away the container, and obviously it's used, so what now? Am I stuck with this?  I can't believe it. I just paid $50.00 for more noise. What is going on?
I bought this filter because I had herd that it was the best hang on hack filter out there. It is great. I run 1 sponge and 2 bags of biomax on mine. My water is nice and clean. the sponge does not allow anything that is not supposed to get through. It is well made. My only complaint is that it is not self proming. You have to pour water into the chamber before you turn it on after a water change. Other than that it is great. It does make a little bit of noise, mostly water splashing. This filter puts out alot of water. I like that you can adjust the flow. Some people might find this filter relaxing. Over all a great filter. The only time that you need to use the carbon is when removing medicine.
I've had this filter for more than a decade (back when it was called "mini"). It just doesn't quit, and I love the versatility of it. I used to buy and replace the media bags, but after a while I got smart and just rinsed them in tank water instead. I really love the sponge - it cleans well and virtually lasts forever. I actually buy it to use in other filters because it's so useful. There's a lot of space for whatever media you prefer (in all honesty, it doesn't even have to be Hagen's media).It wasn't extremely quiet, but it wasn't loud either. I think that when the impeller got something in it (like sand or a pebble), it would rattle a bit, so that would be my cue to clean it out thoroughly.This filter has been made for years and years and nothing's changed - if it ain't broken, don't fix it!.
I bought this filter for a 55 gallon custom tank with 2 smallish koi. The Whisper filter that I bought has turned into the most noisy headache imaginable. Since it's a custom acrylic tank, I am kind of limited in what will fit on/in the tank. However, not only does this HOB (hang on back) filter fit perfectly, it is a stellar performer! It is super easy to set up and use, and super quiet!! (This tank is in my son's preschool class, and once he moves onto kindergarten, someone else will manage the tank. It has to be as simple as possible to work so that my replacement aquarium caretaker can keep up management of the koi.) This fits the bill in every way. I can't recommend this filter any more highly!!!!!
These filters work really well as far as over the top filters go, however, they do seem to have an issue in terms of the motor, i have had several of these filters and each one has an issue where the impeller magnet starts to become unbalanced and starts to stick to one side and then gets stuck and the water stops flowing. this is VERY bad for the motor- it gets very hot if you don't catch it within a few hours.I have found that if you hit the motor box with a hammer- square and mean it (but don't try to put your hammer through it!) the impeller dislodges and begins to spin again.
Love this pump, it's very quiet and keeps my water very clean and clear in my fresh water tank and my goldfish tank. It dose make a little noise when it is first started up but that's because there is air in it, once it has filled with water it's so quiet, help it when ever you turn it back on by cupping water into it till it is flowing on it 's own.It's very important to keep the filter clean, this means turn off the pump and pull it out and flush out the foam and the other 2 filter pieces about every 3-4 weeks for fresh water, or every 2 weeks for goldfish. Change each filter piece as recommended or as needed.I haven't had any problems with it when the power goes out, both restart without hesitation, you do need to keep the water levels up properly or it might have problems then.
I have this guy in a 40 gallon goldfish aquarim along with a typical HOB. I love the biological filtration this little guy provides - the inserts (aside from the carbon) are great for colonizing the beneficial bacteria that maintain your tank's cycle. I really like that you can adjust the flow rate. Also, it runs pretty quietly, which is a huge plus. My only grievance is the little thing that levels it on the back of my tank keeps falling off.. Aside from that, this filter has been perfect so far. Highly recommend.
Bought the AquaClear 50 filter five months ago from Amazon and it works great. The filter media is easy to change,it hasn't clogged up on me yet. I had to buy another suction tube to reach further down in my 36 gal. tank. They all fit together for the extension. The media material hasn't floated up on it like Ive read from other reviews. The filter has to be reprimed after water changes, but I did have a power outage for over an hour and the filter started right back up with no problems. Ive learned that I can plug the filter to my Battery Backup on the computer and that will work until the power is restored.
Looks much better than the old black filter I had. Has an elegant unobtrusive look to it. Fish and plants have been happier too.The adjustment is convenient. I'm using it for my 30 gallon tank and on full speed it more than fulfills the needs of the tank.I'll be buying another at some point! Came quickly.If I had to buy again though I would get an extension tube however so that it could get lower into the tank... If you have a deep tank buy an extension tube with it so it goes all the way to the bottom. I'll be ordering that tube once I find where to get it...
This is a darn good piece of aquarium filer. the price for it on amazon just cant be beat, but its worth every penny no matter where you buy it.  I love the fact that i dont have to purchase any of there media and you can set it up with as much bio rings or sponge as you want .  I bought a second one for my larger tank and put the two bio rings they came with into one and filled the other with some small pieces of lava rock to save money. they run really quiet and seem to be powerful
I use this filter for a 20gal freshwater tank that is relatively full.  The filter is very quiet and works better than any other in tank, power filter I Have used.  Water stays crystal clear and I don't have to spend so much money on carbon filter replacements as often as I was with other power filters that only rely on chemical filtration.  This filter maintains a healthier tank because of the three stage system that uses chemical and biological filtration--keeping your tank healthy and clean.  Would recommend this to any new aquarist and would by again.  My only complaint is that I do have some trouble starting it up again during cleanings but  usually a quick flick of the fan and it starts up again.  I am relatively new to my aquarium hobby and have been maintaining my 20 gallon freshwater tank for 3 years now.
I purchased this to replace a soon to be defunct TopFin filter in my 28gal bow front. I meant to order one size up from the 30... but this 30 gal filter offers seemingly the same filtration my TopFin 40 did, with the added benefit of the three stage filtration- which has come in handy as my tank recently got a minor case of ich; I still get physical and biological filtration while my carbon is out of the filter for treatment. This item was simple to install and assemble, it has wonderful performance, and I would definitely recommend it for freshwater use (yet to try one for salt).
Best Hang on back filter I have used.  I love how it lets you utilize different media types and there is no cartridge.  This actually acts like a canister filter that hangs on the back.  Great for up to 20 gallon long.I however stopped using this filter only because I decided to go with all sponge filters on my shrimp tank.You can put in sponge for course bio filtration filter floss or padding material.  Charcoal or other options.I have mine setup with the sponge some seachem matrix and some filter floss padding.  Worked amazing when I had it setup but it was too much flow for my shrimp tank as it would drown my duckweed.  (believe it or not it was actually killing it&#62; ::)
Put on a 29 gal. aquarium. When turned to low flow it is perfect. Like the option of being able to turn it to high flow for a fast clean when necessary. It is super quite and contrary to other reviews the lid does not rattle. Make sure you level it with a small level. Its a new tank so I replaced the carbon with an ammonia- nitrate remover. You don't need the carbon unless you need to remove medicine from your tank. Replaced an Aqua Tech 30-40 which does not have near the filtering capabilities of the Aqua-Clear.
I really like the filtration setup that the Aquaclear has. It's a stacked filter media design: foam on bottom, carbon in middle, and bio on top. Very simple and effective.However...This filter is far too noisy for a quiet bedroom environment. Do a simple search on the internet and you'll see plenty of people complaining about the impeller rumble/rattling noise. I have to leave the lid off of it while it's running because with it on, the noise level jumps up by about a factor of 2. It's very obnoxious.A better option is the Fluval U2. It's virtually silent and has very effective filtration capability.
I have both the 30 and the Aquaclear 70! The 30 is silent! I have it next to my bed and I am a light sleeper. This is great if you want to customize what type of filter media you want to run.VERY CHEAP TO KEEP! The filter sponge never needs to be replaced, swish in discarded water (used tank water not TAP) in your water change bucket. Then plop it back in the filter, same with the biomax. I don't use the carbon, I have live plants. The only thing to watch is if you have nano fish, somehow I got a CPD (celestial Pearl Danio) sucked up my filter intake tube in the 30? Easy fix, use filter pad with rubber bands to cover it, panty hose, or sponge cover made for it.If the filter makes noise,fill tank with more wateruse the leveling key on the bottomreadjust the lid on the filter (will be snug)
This is a great filter for what it is:  a small waterfall filter for limited fish.  I am presently using it on a 30 gallon tank holding my Koi that are being overwintered in the basement.  Since they aren't very active at 50 degrees, this is working well.  I understand this is a waterfall filter, but I wish the uptake tube had a bit more versatility to it.  While it has an additional tube to stick on the end for deeper tanks and a multi-layered filter, I'm not sure I would be confident using this on much more than a 40 gallon tank.  In fact, I'm kind of nervous using it on a 30 gallon tank:  I just don't think it turns the water over enough for what it is "rated" for.  So my rating is based on what I am using it for, not the 70 gallons they claim it is rated for.  Is that clear or more confusing?
This is a powerful little filter that I added to my 55 Gallon Aquarium. I like that you can customize your media and the adjustment on it (simply moving the spout over or away from the pump suction) allows do to some pretty good flow adjustment.One star less for noise though. It is not loud by any means (the splashing water is about as much as the pump), but I did have to remove the lid as it started to rattle after 2 days.No big deal and so far the filter is running well. Base on all the great reviews this filters has received, I don't think most can go wrong with it.
Unlike a lot of other filters, this one lets you use your own media. BUT you may not even need to because unlike other filters, the inserts are super cheap. I got the surface skimmer attachment, it looks a lot nicer than the green intake tube and cleans up film on your tanks surface.I got this 50 for my 30 gallon salt water. If you are doing salt water you'll want a higher rated capacity filter than what your tank actually is. If I were to buy again I'd go even another size up to the 70 though.
I picked up an old 20 gallon aquarium from a yard sale it had a old tetra whisper on it. As I got more into the hobby this filter seemed to be the most recommended filter. Wanting to up date I picked up the aqua clear 30. I put it on the same day I dirted my tank and as anyone with a dirted tank knows the water is cloudy when you first fill it up or move plant around this filter quickly clears the water up plus is very quite. I can't think of any negatives if in run into problems I'll update this review
This is a great little filter.  I have it in various sizes on 4 different tanks.  It keeps the water crystal clear and is a breeze to maintain.  I love the filter and will buy more!Then I had a problem.  The motor burned out on one filter.  I called Amazon to see if there was anything they would do about it.  I was so pleased when they told me that there was a lifetime warranty on the motor.  Amazon "Over Nighted" me a new filter the day I talked to them.  I had it the next day.  They also sent me a post paid return label to ship the filter back.Such perfect service!!!!!AquaClear 20 Power Filter - 110 V, UL Listed (Includes AquaClear 20 Carbon, AquaClear 20 Foam & AquaClear 20 BioMax)
I had been using the Marineland Biowheel filters but decided to try one of these filters after reading rave reviews.I have this filter on a 20 gallon tank (always buy more filter capacity than you need).  The filter has been in service for more than a year and is still going.  Here are the pros and cons of this filter vs the Biowheel:Pros:- Comes apart and easy to clean- Motor is replacable!- Inexpensive to maintain if you purchase a nylon bag and box of activated carbon which is a lot cheaper than buying carbon inserts)- Case is transparentCons:- Cleaning all filter media removes ALL beneficial bacteria; OTOH the Biowheel is NEVER cleaned and hosts beneficial bacteria- Intake tube is short- Outer shell may not be breakproofThe case is not plastic; if you drop the filter, it would probably crack/break.  The Marineland filters are plastic and non-breakable.All in all this is a nice filter.
I love how it primes itself. I love that I can use my own filter media. I love that I can vary the flow.The only draw back is the sponge filter. When it gets dirty (within a week), it will force the whole filter basket up out of the tank -- it's that powerful. Other than that this was a fantastic buy. I have never seen the tank so clear and clean. We have a red-eared slider and several large goldfish in the tank. (The fish were suppose to be food for the turtle, but he decided to not eat four because he'd rather have them as friends... and they grew to his size).
I am very impressed with this filter.  I like the bio filtration set up it has, and in my opinion it's not noisy.  It's is easy to clean by just using the water that is removed from the aquarium when doing a partial water change.  When cleaned in this manner the bacteria colony that is in the sponge and ceramic's are not lost like it would be if it was the type that you throw away and replace routinely, which was one of the mistakes I made when I first started fishkeeping.
The only issue I had in setting it up was when I turning it on. You'll probably need to put some water in it before running. It's been a while since I've had to set one up, so maybe that was more me forgetting, but I didn't see anything in the directions telling you to fill it with water. Once you do that, it's fine.It is very compact, smaller than the filter I have set up in a ten gallon (this one is in a twenty gallon). I bought a sponge thing to put over the pipe because I have a betta in that tank and don't want his fins to get caught. I don't know that you need it for bettas with this filter, as the intake doesn't seem like it would be so bad without it, but it was $2.50 at a pet store by Fluval, so this way I'll know he'll be fine with the filter.
For a HOB this is a great filter.  It is very big, but has a low profile rise over the tank so it isn't bad. Some noise, i have to see if that is addressable.  It does push some bypass water over the top divider into the discharge stream, but 90% of the water goes through the media,  I also have to experiment with different types of media in the generously sized media compartment.  That's  is the part I like the best and the great flow rate.  I already added more bio ceramic chips, I keep a couple sponge filters in the compartment, charging them with nitrifying bacteria.  When i need to set up a maternity or hospital tank I just pull the charged sponge filter out of the HOB and put in the smaller tank, hook up an air pump to it and it is ready to rock, no break in cycle needed.
This filter is really quiet, have not had any issues with it. I like how you can control the flow with just a simple slide of the intake tube. I usually slide it over to a lower setting when I feed the fish, then slide it back over to max when they are done. The directions say to replace the foam every two months and the bio media every three. I have just rinsed off the foam and bio media in aquarium water, then that way I dont kill the bacteria and it removes any chunks, seems to work really well this way and saves money!
We really need this collar for our Bichon Frise. He barks at anyone entering our home and wouldn't stop without this collar on. He knows how loud he can woof before getting shocked. It helps- but sometimes he just can't help himself and barks while getting a big shock...Also, these collars have consistently worked wonderfully, but for a limited time- after about 6-9 months, it usually just stops working (even changing the battery doesn't help).So, we just keep buying new ones. Wish they could make these last longer!
This is an excellent collar/training system..  PetSafe is a reliable company that takes pet care seriously.  My dogs took to the collars so well, they only need to wear them as a reminder a few hours a week.  They actually go the hang of it after just one doorbell/bark session and actually stayed away from the door the entire time they had the collars on.  If the kids get the dogs going, all I have to do is grab a collar and show them and they settle down immediately.  There is an intimidation factor present and it works wonderfully.  The nylon section is strong and durable and I have had nothing but good luck with the product.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who cringes every time a visitor rings your doorbell or a squirrel passes by.  It truly helps them keep control without you lifting a finger.  Excellent product!
I bought this just before I moved into an apartment. My dog was barking when I would arrive home (because he wanted to be fed), and would continue to bark until I fed him. Since he is a 100lb LARGE dog, this would not go over well once we moved from the country into an apartment. I used this collar right away to curb the behavior before we moved. I used it on the lowest setting so it would be more of a deterrent, and not a painful shock. This collar quickly put a halt to the behavior, and retrained him not to bark. I only had to use it a short time before he no longer needed it. Now we have moved again into a new home, and the behavior has not returned. I would not recommend for long term use.
We have had the collar for several months now. We bought it to use when traveling in hotels so that our large puppy would not howl or bark. Surprisingly after a test run or two at home, she learned when the collar was on she shouldn't bark. So after the first few zaps, she was trained. Now I won't say this will  happen with your pet, but it may. My son's LARGE Lab puppy &#34;borrowed&#34; it and sure enough the same thing happened with her. This is not a solution for 24/7; it is only for certain circumstances. Please be responsible with its use.
This collar is amazing.  My goldendoodle stopped barking immediately.  She easily made the connection between barking and the vibration.  I actually prefer this one over the other PetSafe collar because it has a button that allows you to set the vibration level and also to turn it off.  To get their other model to turn off you need to remove the battery.  I haven't needed to turn it on since about the third time I used it.  I just put the collar on her now when the gardeners or pool service are coming to the house to keep her quiet.  Surprisingly having the collar on seems to keep her calm, perhaps knowing she doesn't need to be on alert and give an alarm.
Well, it's not the collar's fault.  It does work great!  My two Cavaliers won't bark while wearing them.  The problem is.  They know it's the collar.  So, they haven't so much learned not to bark, as they have learned not to bark when they are wearing that collar or if they see me holding it.  Barkley, will actually go hide behind the couch if he sees me with it.  And since you can't safely leave them alone while wearing them, this doesn't halt the annoying barking when I leave. :(
My rescue Wiemer.  barks when I move, get out of bed, walk, ect and sets off the entire pack.  It was so nerve wracking.  He must of had one before.  He welcomes it.  When it warns him...he gets a funny look on his face and doesnt bark any  more.  Peace at last.  I almost cried to put it on him.  But he learned so quickly he doesnt seem to get shocked.  Thank you so m uch
There were so many bad reviews on this item that I was very hesitant to purchase it. After being at my whits end with my little maltipoos barking I decided to give it a try. I absolutely loved this item. I first tried it out on myself to make sure it wasnt to harsh and it wasn't. Its not a shock collar. It vibrates and heats up a bit, thats it. I put it on the lowest setting because my dog is a cry baby and it worked right away. She did not yelp or anything. She just put her head down to try and figure out what was buzzing on her neck. After realizing it was because of her barking, she shut right up. Now when I come in the door she is the quietest dog I have ever seen! Its amazing.
This bark control collar works well, it only shocks if it senses a bark unlike some other ones I've tried. It is small too, and probably the smallest one you'll find so it's great for that small dog you have; small dogs being statistically more likely to bark compared to bigger dogs. The only issue is the collar that came with it is cheap, but you can easily replace it. I should mention the battery being of proprietary design too, but the batteries for these are not any more or less expensive than other batteries for other bark collars so it isn't really worth mentioning.
We have a lovely Sheltie who drives us up the wall with her incessant barking. After trying numerous products and training methods to &#34;attempt&#34; to teach her to bark one alert bark and stop, we finally resorted to using this collar. I really did NOT want to use a shock collar on my dog! However, this has adjustable settings, so we can put it on the lowest setting available. She quickly learned not to bark while wearing the collar. Now, I just need to fasten something of similar weight to the front of her regular collar to see if that will keep her from barking, without actually wearing the shock collar.
I placed this collar on my dog it took several barks from him then all of a sudden he yelped really loud and all 4 paws left the ground, he leaped about  a foot into the air.  I instantly removed the collar and had to calm him down.  I never put it on him again this is not the way to train a dog it's cruelty.  I felt so bad I did this to him.  I sure wouldn't want 2 prongs sticking in my neck shocking me.
We were so happy to have found this screen pet door! We have two smaller sized dogs and a rather large cat. They all use the door and I no longer feel like the doorman! I gave this 5 stars because of how much we appreciate the convenience and it is the perfect size. One issue we had was the plastic sides to the door that attach to the screen kept popping apart. We solved this problem with a tiny bit of super glue. Now it stays together and my pets go in and out as they please. We live in Hawaii where the weather is great, but can't leave the doors wide open due to bugs. So this really has been a great find!!
We have another plastic swinging door for our indoor/outdoor cat, but this one is for a sliding screen door on one of our decks. It's the right size for our cat, was installed in just a few minutes, and works perfectly. The little movable locks on the bottom sides didn't stay in place, but wouldn't have stopped our cat if she wanted to get in or out. We taped over them because they would slide to easily all by themselves. We close the glass door to keep her in or out when necessary.
This rug is a great size and works very well.. I have it under a regular size and shape rectangular open litter box and there is plenty of rug showing all around to catch any stray litter. One of my cats makes a mess every time he uses the litter box, and this catches 99% of his mess...some is bound to follow him, but it's so little that it's hard to even see or find. As far as the price, I don't have an option that is at least a hundred miles away, so for $18 and free shipping and no more litter mess, I'm very happy!
Usually, when I think a product is flawed, I can think of ways to make it better. With this litter rug, I can't really think of anything besides just making it larger/having a variety of sizes. My cats still manage to get litter dust all over the furniture, but I can't really imagine how else to minimize that. The litter box is in a "nook" - under a built-in desk that is not used as a desk, and the litter box opening is on the inside-end of the nook, making it necessary for the cats to go over the rug before getting in to the living room. This rug catches a TON of the dust, but unfortunately, not all of it. I suppose the litter might have something to do with it (World's Best, Multi-Cat).When I've shaken out the rug (to clean it), ridiculous amounts of litter dust came out, suggesting to me that the rug really does catch a lot of the dust.
My cat DIGS like crazy in the litter box and the litter ends up scattered around the entire box and gets tracked all over the floor in the laundry room. I had to sweep the floor twice a day before I purchased this mat. Now he can dig all he wants and the litter is confined mostly to the mat. Very little gets tracked around and I can go a few days without sweeping. It's big enough cover enough of the area surrounding the litter box. It's very sturdy and easy to dump off the litter it holds, shake it out and put it back under the box like new. I actually bought two of these. If you have a cat, you need one of these!
I have 3 cats. One poohs and pees, then immediately jumps out of the litter box, creating a HUGE mess for me to clean up all the time! She's just crazy!I have bought more than 5 different types of Litter Mats, and this one is THE BEST so far.My boyfriend has litter duty, so he placed the litter mat, directly in front of the litter box - at the middle Horizontally.It works so good, I haven't had to clean litter up off my hard wood floor in a few days now.I LOVE IT!!!!Try it!
We just got a new kitten and I was dreading the litter box scatter problem.  Our last cat would get it everywhere.  We tried everything with her.  Crystal litter was the closest we ever got to containing the scatter to the laundry room.  Litter box carpet didn't work for her, because she'd just jump over it.Enter LitterMaid Litter Box Carpet.  I use it in conjunction withClevercat Top Entry Litter BoxandPrecious Cat Kitten Attract Kitten Training Litter.  This litter box carpet is soft to the touch, so the kitten doesn't avoid walking on it.  It is large, so she will jump onto it.  It is textured with rows of carpet grooves to catch stray litter.  Although there is still scatter, the difference is phenomenal.  The best thing is litter doesn't track into the carpet just outside the laundry room.
I got this to replace this other mat I had. My other mat was hurting my cat's feet. He would just jump right out of his litter box scattering the litter all over. This mat is much softer, its very large and now my cat actually steps out of the litter box so its doing a great job of keeping the dropped litter on it. It's very easy to clean, just vacuum with a hose attachment. As for washing it, I hand wash it. Its fairly simple to do so, wet it, use a soft brush to scrub it gently with some mild detergent like Purex, rinse and hang up to dry. It will dry overnight, or a bit faster if you have it near a heating vent or heater. I find using a washer annoying for just one item, and a waste of water.
We purchased this litter mat for our cats litter box. It would drive me nuts when litter would get all over the floor in our linoleum bathroom,  getting scattered everywhere. This mat has definitely helped with a litter control problem. The ridges in the mat help to prevent the litter from getting on the floor. It is big enough to capture a lot of litter. When I change the litter box, all I do is get the vacuum out and sweep up this rug, and that's it. This mat is highly recommended by me, due to its effectiveness at capturing the little granules the litter. That said, I think it was a little overpriced. However, i had a difficult time trying to find anything that would be similar to this. If you want product that's going to work, then buy this.  If you can find it for a little cheaper elsewhere, then they give that a shot. I do recommend this mat though.
I have a small one bedroom apartment and I hide the litter box in the living room in a corner.  Since it is such a small room, I needed something that would catch the litter and not look hideous.  This mat does just that and am very pleased with the amount it catches.  Hardly any litter (that I can tell) makes it past this mat.  It is also easy to clean.  I had originally been shaking it out every morning, but switched to vacuuming it, which picks up the litter well when you vacuum along the grain of the mat.  One time my cat had tracked a little bit of poo out of his box (while we were visiting the in-laws) and the mat caught all that as well with none getting on the actual carpet (whew).  This was also easy to clean up with a damp cloth and some wiping.  I am very glad that I purchased this mat and would definitely recommend it.
With 6 cats it's nice to have a way to feed them that doesn't always require me to 1)be home, 2)fill a food bowl every day.  With 5 slots, I can program these trays to turn once a day (5 days) or twice a day (2-1/2 days).  The batteries last a long time.  The most important thing to consider, if you have multiple feeders, is to coordinate them so they all turn at the same time.  If you want to leave for the weekend, you can fill the feeder on Friday and know that the cats are getting there food until you return home on Sunday.
It works well, and reliably. The menus and button settings are very simple to follow when you have the instructions, but a bit confusing if you have misplaced them, which you inevitably will. Or, more likely, you've left your cat for someone else to care for and they have to figure this thing out.I like this feeder a lot! But I strongly recommend that you take a photo of all of the instructions and keep it on file, print it out and/or email it to anyone that you've left in charge of this thing. Five feeds is also too much to leave around for wet food, so don't try doing this with wet food. For dry, it's great.
This contraption latches at the dial, which unlatches at the desired time.  On the far end, the latched door has about 1cm of play, and it is trivial for a finger or a cat paw to get between the door and the lip.  It is then easy to force the thin food dish out through the latched lid, even without opposable thumbs or a homo sapiens intellect.I put food in this unit and set it for 12 hours.  I placed the unit on the floor.  My cat began attacking it, and was noshing within 10 minutes.  Amazon.com is making it easy to return, so I guess I'll try another feeder.
my cat was ALWAYS waking us up at 3:30-5am to feed her! Instead of locking her out of the bedroom (where she will probably figure out how to do damage to punish us) the PetSafe electronic feeder is satisfying her now. only challenge is trying to program it for the exact times that will keep her satisfied. trial and error! but we'll get it down - it's easy to program when you have the routine. tip: keep a notepad with the feeding times and readjust them as needed, then reprogram intermittently.
We bought this unit after researching several options. We knew this had a space for an ice pack, but it wasn't until we got it home that we could see that the ice pack only keeps one compartment cold at a time--the one that is in the &#34;open&#34; position. The other four compartments are not kept cold. We don't prefer to portion and freeze our pet food ahead of time. The idea was to make it more convenient, not make it strategically more challenging. For wet food, this is not a good choice.
I bought this because I wanted a way to keep my puppy interested/entertained while I was at work for the day. I mounted the feeder up high where he can't get to it and then I put either some sort of treat or toy inside and set it to release mid-day while I am gone. It was affordable and does exactly what I had hoped; plus dishes are deep enough to hold some sizable treats/toys. Although the feeder works great for my purposes, I could see how it might be problematic for other uses - for example if you have a cat or dog that will really mess with the feeder to try and get the food out ahead of time - since the feeder isn't super sturdy.
I got the 2-meal version of this product. I have two cats, one of which is very food aggressive and will do his best to get into any container that smells like it has food in it. He was able to get into this pet feeder within an hour by prying open the flimsy plastic top.I like the idea behind it, however. The timer works well enough, but is not for precise timing (you can get it within a half hour or so). This would be excellent for cats that aren't food-aggressive or clever enough to figure it out.
This is a great way to provide measured amounts of food to cats at regular intervals.  We set it to feed twice a day and it will go for two days before it needs to be refilled.  My only complaint is that one of the cats is able to turn the tray and get to some of the other food in the unit.  Other than that, this is a great product and a true life saver if you need to go away for a couple of days and don't want to leave a giant mound of dry cat food for your cats.
Let me start off by saying my cat is a complete and utter (13 pound) glutton; he would literally eat himself to death if presented the opportunity. This feeder has stood up to his desperation - so far. On the first day he chewed on it and I was certain he was going to break it open. Somehow we convinced him to leave it alone and I was able to go away over the weekend and he was fed appropriately the entire time. I've had it set up for about 5 days, he has yet to break it open and he loves it. It was a great buy!***EDIT: 11/2010 -- A year and 1/2 later, my cat figured out how to turn the feeder to get to the next meal. Unfortunately, this feeder has been rendered useless! ***
I received one in 2 days after ordering it.  I read a review that this person's cat didn't like it because the noise scared her cat.  So I thought there was something wrong with the one I just received.  Which there wasn't!  I called customer service & they were so nice & they said they'd  sent me another one the very  next day after I receiver the 1st one. I received that one.  I haven't used it yet but it works & it is quiet.  I set it for 2 hrs. but the only thing wrong.  You can set it for 2, 4, 6 ,8 up to 48 hrs. But it might go off 2hrs 15mins not right on 2 hours.
I bought this feeder to get my cats on a regular feeding schedule that didn't depend on me, with the hope of stopping the association between me and food. Unfortunately, this didn't really work out. After using it for a few days, my two cats were following me around more than ever with constant meowing to indicate their nearness to death by starvation. When I was nearby the feeder for longer than usual, I figured out why this was as I watched one of my cats pull out the food containers from under the locking top. Essentially, the cats would wait until I left the room and pull out the containers and eat all of the food. Hours later, when the feeder was supposed to open, they would be starving again. This was a fatal flaw, and I ended up having to return the product.
This product works well.  It is easy to program and use.  The instructions are clear and easy to interpret.  I have had this product for over 2 years and it still is working great.  I would like it better if I could actually use 5 slots to feed my dog.  The 5th slot can not be used because that is left open.  So, it really is only a 4 slot feeder.  I have a cat feeder that has a closing cover for the 'open' slot.  The cover opens with the first feeding, so all slots can be filled.  I am hoping future models will solve this problem.
Despite some of the negative reviews, I purchased this item anyway because there were far more positive reviews.  WHAT A MISTAKE!!!  We went away this past weekend where on Friday I set up the timers to open on 2 separate occasions during our absence.  We returned Sunday morning to see that they never opened.  My poor cat is 8 and a half years old and he went without food for 48 hours!!!!  We feel so terrible and guilty.  I'm returning this piece of &#$*$*#
This worked fine for me since I was only looking for an automatic feeder to feed my puppy lunch when I'm not able to get home in time. The trays are actually pretty small. I would only suggest using this for small dogs or cats. Also, the place where you put the battery does not have a cover. My battery hasn't fallen out or anything but I think if your pet was to play around or bump into the feeder, the battery could pop out. I can easily put a piece of tape over it, but why not make this with a battery cover?
I bought this to hold dry dog food. The bag I normally buy comes in a 15lb size. It holds this much and more. I think it could hold 25lbs of the brand I use. The wheels appear to be optional. They come in a bag for you to install them. I left them off since I have no need to move the container much. The seal seems like it will last and keep the food fresh.It has a small latch to secure it. I have small dogs so this allows me to buy a large bag and maintain it's freshness. It should pay for itself with the savings.
I bought this for kitten food and as my cat has grown it's gotten more and more reasonable. It easily holds a 14-pound bag (the largest I can buy) of kitten food and will easily hold larger bags as I start buying cat food. It keeps it fresh, which the bag alone does not, which is great and in the long run really does save money.My only complaint is that the wheels fall off. I may need to empty it out, turn it over, and whack the wheels with a hammer (or glue them in) to get them to stick more thoroughly. It's almost impossible to re-seat a loose wheel with the bin full of food.
I use this container to store cat food (we have 6 cats).  We buy the large 18 lb. bags of food, and until getting this container, the bag would just sit on the counter or on the floor, and it looked really messy.  Also we've had a problem with ants, so having the food in this air-tight container is so much better, to keep the food fresh and ant-free, and it looks much better than a big bag of cat food sitting around.  The container is durable, easy to move around, and I like that it is see-through.  Overall I'm pleased with this product and would definitely recommend it!
I ordered the Iris 30-qt food storage container with casters. What I received was a bird seed dispenser. I realize mistakes happen so I returned it the same day in the original box along with a copy of my order for the storage container. Instead of sending the right product, I received an e-mail saying they were refunding my credit card. No explanation for why they weren't sending the container, no apology. And I'm ripped off for the return postage of a little over eight dollars. I subsequently ordered an almost identical item on Amazon from another company and am pleased with it. P.S. It was cheaper, too!
I've used Selcon in conjunction with Seachem Garlic Guard or Kent Garlic Xtreme for the past 2 years with no fish diseases in my 60 gallon saltwater tank.  I'm also meticulous about 10-15% weekly water changes in tandem with supplements.  My Kole Tang has never had ich nor HLLD.  I soak all foods - Rod's Herbivore Blend, Hikari mysis, spirulina brine shrimp, Spectrum NLS pellets, Formula 2 frozen, and nori for 20-30 minutes prior to feeding.  I also feed .50ml weekly into the tank which benefits corals and filter feeders.  Some people complain about cost which is minimal compared to time and medications spent on treating ill fish.  A little bit of this stuff goes a long way so avoid overdosing and the bottle will last a long time.
This stuff is great. Iv used it to cycle my 55, 20 and 36 gallon fish tanks. It takes a few days to cycle it.I suggest you put this stuff onto your filter pad. I put it on the bottom of the foam and carbon inserts on the aquaclear filters. Putting it on the bottom will cause bacteria to grow a lot easier.Also this is a water conditioner so when adding new water you can add this stuff to the tank and it will take care of chlorine and metals in the water.This stuff will float around in your tank until your filter pushes it under, but if you soak it in a cup it will sink immediately, which I recommend doing.
It works. Follow the directions and in a few days, you will be free of ick. But I had a loach and it died about a week after I treated the tank. The directions didn't say anything about loaches, but other reviewers did. So if you have a loach and it doesn't have ick, remove it to a separate holding tank while you treat the water, if you can.This stuff really works. Use as directed. I have a lot of tetras (which I think are sensitive to this stuff) but I used a half dose and the ick cleared up in a couple days.I did also turn out the lights for about 2 and a half days on the recommendation of an aquarium site or another reviewer here. I read that the eggs need light to hatch.It turns the water blue, but the fish acted normal, except the loach. I wish I had just taken the poor thing out, but I didn't have a holding tank. :(
I bought a Betta and some tetras at the fish store and ended up with Ick. (That's what happens when you don't quarantine!) Anyway, I was hesitant to try this due to another person's comments that it hurt their Betta. I figured I had to use something and used it, carefully following the instructions on the bottle. It cured my Betta and Neon Tetras without any harm to the fish. All the fish are healthy and happy and glad to be rid of that Ick after only 3 treatments! Highly recommend. Be sure that your water's ammonia and nitrite levels are checked when using this. You don't want your biological filter getting messed up, which is always possible using any medications...
My mobile aquarium vet told me to use this for my 17 year old gold fish which had Ich. I ordered it and did use a little less than suggested but treated for a week and Ich is gone !! My goldfish is happy and Ich free again. I feel this product is safe and does what it states it will do and fish are safe which is the most important thing of all here. THANK YOU FOR THIS MEDICINE! Great delivery on time and fast as well. Amazon always comes through. (( You simply shake the bottle well, turn it upside down pointing into the pond / tank and add drops )) The reason I used less is because I love my fish and I've had him a very long time and was a little scared. All is well. My fish showed no signs of distress at all.
I've tried a number of ich treatments over the many years I've had fish.  This works and it's pretty much the only one that does.  Yes, it's pretty poisonous, but none of the "natural" stuff works.  It's a shame they don't sell this type of product at the big chain pet stores (just the crap that literally does nothing), but it's cheap and quick to arrive via Amazon anyway (with one day shipping!).  This big bottle means I'll probably never have to purchase it again though!I've had no issues with it staining the tank, but it will stain your hands.  (I just use a gritty scrub afterwards, even SOS pads, to get it off.)  The only "con" to this product is that I'll probably have to wait awhile before I can begin using the dirty fish tank water to water my plants again.
I ordered this product and the bottle I received had a completely different label, I got Mardel Quick Cure with a blue label, it looked nothing like the yellow label pictured here, perhaps its the same thing and the company was sold, but who knows. I tried the product for &#34;cotton mouth&#34; on a few of my cardinal tetras, it looks like the fungus has shrunk in size but after two weeks of the 1/2 dose recommended for tetras they still have the white growths on their mouths, i will move on and try something else.
My local fish stores swears by this - I don't have a reef tank but a freshwater tank.  Fits in my Eheim Canister filter (I have the small Pro3) alongside the biomedia.  I run a pretty intense tank with lots of fertilization, high light, CO2, lots of food (many plecos) and a fair amount of mulm and organic debris from the large number of live plants.  This helps keep my water clear and in balance.  I can't say exactly how much this contributes to the health of my tank but I will continue to use it as a safety net.  I also ran Purigen for a while but it was getting expensive given the size of my tank, so I'm saving the Purigen for my smaller tanks that also have a discoloration issue (from the driftwood) and instead use Chemi-Pure in my larger display tank.
I bought this pump at Petsmart about 2 yrs ago and it barely functioned at all.  I returned it and ordered a Hagen Elite from Amazon that has been working perfect non-stop for 2 yrs.  I recently set up a new tank and was looking for an air pump, and decided with all the good reviews, to try a Rena again hoping my bad experience was a fluke.  Well the same exact thing happened.  This thing was barely capable of literally sending  3 or 4 bubbles every minute out of an air wall.  So I went to my local aquarium store and purchased a Hagen Elite again (which was half the price of the Rena), as I should have done in the first place.  Worked perfect, sending out a thousand bubbles a minute.  One bad experience could be bad luck, but not two.  I would never purchase a Rena air pump again.
I have owned 3 air pumps, one being a whisper. This one for sure is louder but more powerful. The kit that comes with it is nice and has everything you need to get started. The whisper broke so I decided to give this a try. Overall it pumps out a lot of oxygen and comes with everything but i can hear it across the room. I have tried on different surfaces and even just holding it in my hand. It might me okay stashed in a cabinet but if you have a silent room you won't miss it. It's hard even to hear the bubbles with it on. I may return this for a refund and try another whisper or a fusion. Good luck.
This product is absolutely fantastic--I use it at home, and at the pet shop where I work. It's safe for just about anything, but DO NOT purchase this product from Amazon. This is the one and only time I've ever had a problem with anything I ordered from Amazon. Twice I ordered it from them, and between the two orders, I barely got one full bottle. The lids were not screwed on properly and the liquid leaked out both time--badly enough the second time that the bottle itself was in a bag inside the box, and then the BOX was in a bag due to leakage. I love Stress Coat for my fish, definitely--but I'll go ahead and pay the few extra dollars at pet stores to make sure I get a full bottle.
I've been using Api for my tanks for well over 17 years and i would never change their products for any other brand in the world. That said all Api products should become a staple in any aquarium/fish tank cabinet because you will never find anything that will work better including the Api Stress Coat Water Conditioner.Make sure you read the directions properly and have patients because treating any tank takes time and relies on a lot of factors.I have tried multiple times throughout the years to use other brands but without exception each and every one of them have failed miserably simply put they just won't work!I trust Api products with my eyes closed, i would highly recommend them to everyone and i definitely will be buying them for as long as i own tanks.
This is a great product for adding new fish to your tank, doing water changes, or anytime that your fish may become overly stressed (i.e. power outage).  This product does not remove ammonia from your water, but helps to replensih any slime coat on your fish.  I have found this to be a common misconception of this product in that most people believe that this product will remove ammonia.  Filtration, water changes, and surface agitation are the only ways to effectively remove ammonia.  I use this product for all of my water changes to remove harmful chemicals in tap water, and anytime that I add a new fish to our tank.
Last week my new female betta fish Annabelle somehow managed to shred her delicate fins in her balinese lantern (which is rough around the edges). Having heard about API's stress coat, I picked up a bottle from a retail pet store chain. Within a few days, I started noticing some growth in my betta's fins. Clearly the aloe vera was doing its job on my poor girl's shredded fins. Even her missing ventral fin has started growing back. I am definitely pleased with the results that I have seen with this product. Definitely will use this for my bettas if their fins are ever damaged.
I understand that a lot of people like to use Seachem's Prime dechlorinate solution, but after trying it, I found that the health and condition of my fish went down quickly. But after using API's Stress Coat Water Conditioner, things improved significantly.When I used Prime, according to directions, my fish reacted oddly and distressed and seemed to have a reaction to it. A few of my guppies died, and the community tank was in trouble. But after switching to API's solution, and doing a partial water change, I immediately saw their level of activity go up. My guppies seemed "happier" as did my Nerite snails and Red Cherry shrimp. The formulation of this product is safer than Prime, it would seem.I am very happy with the results of the API product and will continue using it. As for Prime, I dumped the whole bottle down the drain. Lesson learned and I won't be buying Prime ever again.Water specs: Zero ammonia; zero nitrites, 5ppm nitrates, and 7.2 pH.
This stuff will raise the ammonia level in your aquarium extremely, make the water cloudy and kill your fish. It does NOT neutralize ammonia, nitrate or nitrite. I do NOT recommend this product at all. I have always used Prime and for some reason decided to try this. Big mistake! I highly recommend Prime, it is much better for your aquarium and fish. It removes chlorine, chloramine, ammonia and detoxifies nitrite and nitrate and provides an excellent slime coat. If you want your fish to live and do well use Prime by Seachem, not this!!
Great for my goldfish who is 17 years old now !! It's all I've ever used for each tank/water change and he's never been sick a day. He was so tiny when I bought him and grew big. I've read a lot about other products but since this works so fantastically for all these years, I don't want to change. It seems top quality to protect fish. I use it during transport too. It seems to sooth my fish. It arrived on time. I'm going to buy the big bottle again which lasts a good amount of time // months // years. They put an expiration date on their bottles too.
Two of my fish had their fins damaged by an aggressive tank mate.  While this is a nice water conditioner, I bought it with specific hopes that it would aid in my fishes tail fins regrowth and it has done just that.  I was very upset at the damage and didn't know how well mother nature alone would take care of it and this stress coat fish and tap water conditioner has definitely delighted me with it's efficiency.  Pay close attention to the dosing.  Extra size dose is recommended for fin damage.
I've been using Stress Coat since I ran out of my other water conditioner.  Stress Coat works fine -- at least the fish look well.  The cap can be used to measure out the conditioner, but I have a five gallon tank.  I change about two quarts of water a week, so each batch of water gets five drops.  That's been working for me, as my fish have lived a few years and they're getting big.  One 16 ounce bottle will probably last until they die.
There are a great deal of water conditioners out there on the market for the fish tank. This is one that I've used regulary since 1999. I use it to condition my water for water changes, topping off the tank and when setting up a new tank. It removes both chlorine and chloramine from tap water. It also reduces fish stress and heals any damaged tissue, torn fins, and skin wounds. It also replaces the natural secretion of slime that is interrupted by handling, shipping, fish fighting, or other forms of stress and reduces the susceptibility to disease and infection. It is a great product, which I have no trouble recommending to others. I usually buy the larger size, but when in a pinch I buy this size.
I've used this product for 17 years for my goldfish............it's done a great job since my goldfish is now 17, obviously.... I ordered it on Dec. 28 and it just arrived....wow......long time. I'm not sure I would order from this company again as it's my first time. I usually buy from another one. It did arrive fine, no leaking but took forever, imho..... It will last a long time and has the expiration date on it too. Good stuff just took too long to get to me and Elvee. Actually and truthfully, it's the only product I've used for all these years and my fish was healthy and happy - NO DISEASES...........recently, he got Ich...... I will still use this product. My mobile Marine Vet loves API products, fyi........ : ))))))
I can not understand why there people who DO NOT read.This product should NOT be used as a water conditioner, NOT your function .. and by the way many people do NOT follow instructions.this product contains beneficial bacteria that HELP the filtering process BIOLOGICAL aquarium. I have an aquarium of 430 liters MARINO. and used it for 02 years .. works very well is excellent and if clear .. maintains a clear water, the fish are happy. the corals are doing well.I have no complaints of the product. works very well
I don't have multitudes of pH testers around to attest to the accuracy, but it never gives me readings that seem off. It's easy and fast. I'm so used to my ammonia tester (that I use more often) that requires 5 minutes of waiting, it's nice to just put the water in, put the drops in, shake, and see what the water's at. This hasn't changed my life or anything, but it's everything that I wanted in a pH test kit.
I got this to test my pH while setting up a freshwater tank.  Where I live, the water is quite hard, so I knew some adjustments would be needed.  This is a very simple to use kit and the laminated card that tells you the explanation of the test result colors is great.  However, because it only goes up to 7.5, I had to do a lot of guesswork to get my tank down to those levels.  The color stays the same until the pH falls down to the levels this kit is designed for - not a design flaw at all, but it isn't the most effective kit when you live in a hard water area.  I suspect the same would be the case if you live somewhere with very soft water, too.
I got lots of information about fish from ppl. who sold them evidently someone went over a short care chart about fish, water conditions,how important it is to get a API Master Kit, Cycling your fish, knowing the fish capability chart having the fish that are best for all newbies. I'm happy I can order the liquid API Nitrite and ammonia without having to purchase the whole API Master kit.I purchased  Seachem Matrix to keep good bacteria flowing thu my filter all the time keeping me from losing fish ,knowing I've done all I can to make my lil pals  &#34;Happy&#34;!
Have had this for a few weeks now and love it. The kit will test for PH levels in two ranges (high/low), Ammonia, Nitrite, and Nitrate. I have been using this kit for my aquaponics system and it has all the needed tests to ensure the right levels for plants and fish. This would also work great for an aquarium as well since they have similar needs. Instruction are clear and easy to follow and kit comes with enough solution to test probably 75 times. Check out my full review of the product here - http://youtu.be/SFRlC8q_AOw
I used this to diagnose a water quality issue with a tank I set up.  I seeded it with filter media from an established tank and thought it was cycled after a couple weeks.  This kit allowed me to monitor ammonia, nitrite and nitrate to determine it wasn't cycled at all.  After several more weeks, levels were good and stable and my fish are doing great.Get this and some cheap pH strips for quick checks.  It can save a lot of time and money avoiding having to guess what's going on with your water.
I'm not sure if this is the best choice for someone that just dabbles in fish keeping. I have a goldfish tank, a betta/cory tank and a platy tank. I love having fish and wanted a way to test the water. After reading reviews that the test strips were less accurate I bought this test kit. It just takes more time and fuss than I was expecting. A couple of the tests require drops, shaking, more drops and then waiting 5 mins for results. It's also hard to get the colors to match up, my pH test didn't seem to match any of the colors at all. As far as accuracy goes, I don't really know.
I've been using Api for my tanks for well over 17 years and I would never change their products for any other brand in the world. That said all Api products should become a staple in any aquarium/fish tank cabinet because you will never find anything that will work better including the Api Freshwater Master Test Kit.Make sure you read the directions properly and have patients when doing your water testing because I have tried multiple times throughout the years to use other brands but without exception each and every one of them have failed miserably simply put they won't work as good as any Api product!I trust Api products with my eyes closed, I would highly recommend them to everyone and I definitely will be buying them for as long as I own tanks.
As a keeper of freshwater fish, you know that it's important to monitor a good number of levels in your tank.This kit covers most of what you'll need to monitor in your water.-pH (including high level test)-Ammonia (NH3) from fish waste-Nitrite (NO2) oxidized ammonia-Nitrate (NO3) oxidized nitritesThe kit even includes a pamphlet which explains how to correctly perform the tests and what to do about bad results. If you don't understand the nitrification process, I suggest reading up on it so that you may better understand why you're testing these levels and how to correct them.Here's a link that will get you started understanding the nitrogen cycle in your tank: [...]
After reading on multiple fish forums that test strips were inaccurate, I decided to purchase this kit as it was highly recommended by lots of fish keepers. It certainly lasts a long time considering I bought it six months ago and still have about half of the solutions left. Anyway, my only gripe with it is the ammonia test. I've found that it's difficult to distinguish whether the water is 0ppm or .25ppm. After testing multiple water sources (tap, bottled, tank water) I found that although the test tube appears like it could be .25 it must actually be 0ppm assuming of course that the bottled water I tested has no ammonia in it which I'm pretty confident about. Also, be sure to VIGOROUSLY shake all of the bottles before using them for the tests as some of them have particles that settle to the bottom and can result in an off reading (Nitrate Bottle #2 in particular). All in all, this is what you need if you plan on starting a serious freshwater aquarium!
This kit is wonderful and very accurate.  It also saves a lot of money than doing the strip tests and gives you more accurate measurements.  I've found it very easy to use, fast to use, and it's helped me keep my aquariums in top condition.  The only negative I can see is that it should have included one more vial since you do end up doing all the tests on the aquarium and that way you can have them all at once.  It would also be nice to be able to purchase replacement vials since they do break (glass).  Otherwise the cards are great for comparing colors, the booklet goes into detail that will help a new aquarium lover to keep their system in top form.
The Master Test Kit comes with 8 small bottles of chemicals, four plastic vials, and a number of testing cards. For each test, you take a vial of aquarium water, put in the required number of drops (it says on the bottle) and compare the color to the card. The tests are simple, and something like this is a good first step in righting water problems that can kill fish or cause algae growth.My gripe with this kit, however, is just how fragile the vials are. Simply trying to put a cap onto one of them caused it to crack right down the side. When capping them, remember to not over-tighten them.
Having three aquariums, we would periodically go to the local pet store when either the water seemed a bit &#34;off&#34; or some or all of the fish were behaving oddly. At the pet store, they use test strips, and the results from those can be very inaccurate. The instructions included with the API test kit make it very easy to obtain samples correctly, and the API test kit provides much more accurate results than you will get from test strips.This kit is an excellent item to have on hand for your freshwater aquarium, both for periodic checkups (I check out water about once every six months because of some issues with the local water supply) and for those times when the fish or their water seem unhealthy or unbalanced. A great kit that includes all the major test types at a great price.
This is a great kit if your looking to keep an eye on your fish friend's water. I would like to air two small gripes...1. That &#34;Over 800 Tests&#34; on the front probably means total, not for each individual test (so your getting about 200 tests of each chemical). Not terrible but I think a bit misleading.2. DON'T DROP THE TEST TUBES. I dropped one on a tile floor my first week with the kit and went to buy a replacement online. I wouldn't mind buying a 4 or 6 or even 10 pack of them. But the smallest replacement pack is 24 tubes... what would I do with 24 tubes? But it's easy enough to test, dump and grab more water.Overall a great kit if your paranoid about water quality like me.
Tests 5 things: Ph, High Ph, Ammonia, Nitrites and Nitrates. Comes with 4 test tubes with stoppers, so I use the same test tube for both Ph and High Ph. Most tests can be performed in less than 5 minutes start to finish. Ammonia and Nitrates take a few minutes longer. The instructions are written fairly well and give advice what to do if the results are not in the normal range - some suggestions are to buy the products they sell, of course.  The only thing I could not find in the directions was how to safely discard of the used test tube liquids and how to clean the tubes.The manual has blank pages for keeping track of your tank tests results. The results seem very accurate, much more than the test strips I was using. I use a small measuring cup to pour water from the aquarium into each test tube. I do not like to dip the used tubes into the aquarium once the tube has had chemicals in it, even after I rinse it out.
I gave this product four stars just because it doesn't come with a hardness test. I mean, come on, its supposed to be a "master kit"--now I have to fork out another $10 just see how hard/soft my water is? For that, I feel kind of jipped. However, it does what it is supposed to do. The NitrATE test is a bit ridiculous. And the ammonia test requires 8 drips from one bottle followed by 8 drips from another bottle, therefore if you are testing everyday with a new tank (like me) the stuff can run out pretty quickly. But, like I said, it seems to work and is fairly comprehensive aside from lacking a water hardness test. AND this seems to be the kit most people recommend. 4 stars.
This is my first time getting a freshwater testing kit, but I am so glad I got this one.  The price is very good compared to other's and it comes with all the levels you need to test.  pH, higher pH, nitrite, nitrate, and ammonia testing.  Very easy to use as well.  Each bottle says how many drops you need and you just fill the water to the line.  Shake a little and wait 5 minutes.  Very quick and painless.  Rinse them out and your good to go again.  I highly recommend this kit for anyone who needs to test their fish water.
Then this is the kit for you! Kit includes everything you need to make brightly colored fluids out of your fish tanks' normally clear-ish water. Made me go "mwah ha ha ha haaa" the first time. Quality kit, the test tubes are great and having 4 allows for simultaneous testing of the key parameters. Extremely helpful as I did a fish-in cycle and needed to monitor closely to make sure no one died. ;) Thanks to the kit, all 3 fish survived the cycle, and we are now a mature tank!
I've worked with and kept freshwater aquarium fish for years. In stores and in my home this is the kit that I choose to use because it contains 2 pH, Ammonia, Nitrite, and Nitrate tests. Other test kits do not last as long. The box that it comes with helps to keep the glass test tubes from rattling around and hold the bottles upright without losing anything. My only complaint comes about the results cards...they are easy to misplace and do not hold up as well when wet as I feel a test kit should.Overall, this is the best and cheapest water test kit that you can get. It will last for years.
I bought this product after receiving advice from [...] When I tested for the first time everything came back perfect. I then decided to add more fish to my tank and after a couple of days I had a huge Ammonia spike. This test kit saved all of my fishes lives because I was able to do a water change right away (after finding out that I had Ammonia in the tank.)I also was having a problem with too much Ammonia in my tank even after a water change. I decided to test my tap water and I found out that I had 1ppm of ammonia coming from my tap. That is a crazy amount.Buy this product and you will not be disappointed. The only negative I have about it is that the Nitrate test takes a while. It is a lot of shaking the bottle of test solution 2 and the test tube. It is still pretty easy and you can have all of the test preformed in a few minutes.
At first I was reluctant to get this item as some reviews on Amazon stated that they received an outdated test kit that was already a couple years past the expiration date.  But had a good breath of relief when the expiration date said 2018, that's 5 years!  Not too shabby.  I have never had a liquid test kit before purchasing this so I assumed it tested for almost anything.  I was only slightly disappointed that the kit does not test for Kh and Gh.  And there are not test kits that only read for Kh and Gh, so I have to buy the API test strips that test for everything if I want to see the status of my Kh and Gh.  Sour about that.  That's the only reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5.  Other than that, it accurately measures Ammonia, Nitrites, Nitrates, and Ph.  4 Stars!
I really enjoy this product. The convinience to do the analysis almost every day at a negligeble cost. My water has a very veird pH so I have the tendency to keep it monitored almost every day, I don't have nitrogen problems, so I don't care much obut those one.Like the strips it is a colorimetric methods, and sometimes you have an indication of what is your status. I work in a lab, and I have access to a bench pH meter, so every once in a while I test the pH in the lab, and with my surprice this test is much more accurate than the strip one. I use to use the API strips and the pH always resulted higher than the one I measure in the lab, however, whith this colorimetric it can get pretty close.The price of this is good, about 10$ in savings compare to the pet store.
I came to amazon for this product because it was so much cheaper than the local pet stores.  The instructions explain how to do all the water testing, so you should have no issues.  I would recommend cleaning out the test tubes and not leaving the test water with solutions in them for long as they will start to slightly stain the glass (particularly the one that will appear yellow).  This could make it more difficult to get a good reading if your glass is already stained partly yellow.Been using the set for a year an still have plenty left.  Initially, we were testing quite frequently during the tank cycling.  Now we test about once a month to check the water is staying healthy.
I've used test strips before but wanted a more accurate test after redesigning my tank. Everywhere I looked on the internet people recommended this testing kit. I was happy to find this test kit cheaper than local fish or pet stores. Nothing was broken or leaking when I opened it and the test tubes seem fairly durable. The kit was really straightforward on how to test the water and each bottle is labeled with the number of drops needed. The laminated color card is really nice since its constantly by water and getting wet. Overall I'm really happy with this kit.
If you don't have this yet then you must have this!  I have a fish room with 14 good sized freshwater species tanks and this test kit is the best I've tried.  And I've tried just about all the kits in the market.The only caution I would give is to watch the expiration date.  Also, the testing solutions may go bad as the bottles are constantly exposed to air.  So, I would replace them once every two years regardless of the expiration date.The color chart can be tricky to read under dim light, so check against bright light in order to get the shades correct.  I typically compare under a full spectrum day light bulb in one of the tanks.Strongly recommended.
I'm only giving this three stars, not because of the product but because of the way it was shipped. The box on arrival was smashed, when I opened it, the tray and cover for the kit were totally destroyed. I've thrown away the tray container, ordinarily I would have sent it back but I needed this kit badly...I've decided to keep the rest and will make something to keep everything together with. The product is easy to use and accurate, I've been using API products for a while and I trust them.
This a very nice test kit for testing Ammonia, Nitrite, Nitrate, and pH. Easy to follow instructions. The bottles are marked with the test they are for and how many drops are to be used. Test tubes are easy to fill, marked with proper water level, and the lids fit nicely. Easy to read color sheet for determining test results. Test instructions are easy to read and follow. Instruction book also includes a log to record results (good for one aquarium only unless you use a different page for each one).Highly recommended.Oct. 28, 2012:This test kit has been very useful. I am very happy with the test kit. It is easy to use and has helped my greatly in keeping my aquarium water correct.
This is THE test kit for freshwater tanks. I have been in the hobby for approximately 6 years and I quickly found this kit to be the most reliable as well as being widely available. It may be pricier than the dry "test strips" available but I wouldn't trust one of those if it was free. This liquid kit is what we used in the specialty aquarium shop where I worked, on our own water and on our customers' samples. This test kit is what I will always use, and contains all necessary tests. You're not paying for any frivolous tests. Your fishies will fare better with these tests.
So far everything works as advertised.  The tests are simple to perform.  It comes with four test tubes (not actual test tubes) that has 5 mL marking.  Some notable:  (1) the instructions are written in small type. For you middle-agers out there, you'll need reading glasses.  You'll find it easier to write the desired test results like pH, nitrate, nitrite, etc on a larger piece of paper rather than looking at the small print all the time.  (2) there is a section in the back of the instructions are some blank tables for you to write test results in (i.e. logs), you might want to use your own logs.  Finally, you'll need to be able to count to 10 as you are putting the drops in the test vessels.
I'm new to fishkeeping- I purchased a tank with all the trimmings and a lovely betta a few months ago. I used SafeStart to cycle my tank, but soon realized checking my water perimeters was far more important than I had previously thought. For one I didn't even know if my tank had actually cycled or not! Was the ammonia too high? Heck if I knew! So I purchased this.This kit is easy to to use, the instructions easy to follow. The only think that irks me is that for nitrates, several of the colors on the card are the SAME EXACT COLOR. I've looked at it in different lighting conditions, and had other people do the same. So is the nitrate level 10ppm or 20ppm? No one knows, cause the colors for both are exactly the same! Same for 40ppm and 80ppm. Knocked it down a star for that.
I have a tube of the test strips, but things like pH and Nitrites I wanted better measurements of. This kit works great, and gives very accurate measurements of pH and High pH values (separate tests), as well as Ammonia (I use the Seneye monitoring system for this too), but also tests for Nitrites and Nitrates.Since my water is very hard, it's hard to lower the pH below 8, so I may have to use RO/DI water, or find a pitcher filter or something to provide better water when I do water changes. So far the pH of 8 seems ok for the 5 Tetras, the Angelfish, Pleco, and a few ghost/cherry shrimp, and my fav little dwarf crayfish.
And should have for all other fishkeepers. This is the standard test kit in the hobby. I have looked into other kits, but this one is probably the easiest one to use. If you ask questions on any fishkeeping forum this kits readings gonna be the ones most people are going to ask for. I know all kits should produce the same readings, but they dont. Some kits measure different ions of the various chemicals you will be testing for. Others just have different colored reagents, which can be another source of confusion when trying to figure out where your levels are. I do wish there was more of a color gradient to the results, some times it's kinda hard to say exactly what your levels are. But i think we might be limited by chemistry and price point there.
I am new to the aquarium hobby and the idea of testing my own water was very intimidating to me.  However after some encouragement from some well experience hobbyist, I ventured out with this kit.  I have to say it has totally been worth it.  It is worth every penny.  It is more accurate than any test strip kit you will ever get.  You will get WAY more tests out of this kit than you will out of any test strip bottle as well.I would LOVE to give this a 5 stars, but the color chart would need some improvement.  I would like for it to be more detailed.  I hear that the individual test bottles have better color charts.  I have contacted API directly to see about getting the individual charts for easier color reading.
I've had fish tanks for many years and began using this kit regularly since 1999. Part of properly caring for my fish involves regularly testing the tank water and this kit does it easily and quickly without much fuss and mess. To do a test, you take a small amount of water and put it into a test vial, add few drops of test liquid, wait five minutes then match the color of the test tube with the laminate card to tell you the results. Nothing can be easier.I highly recommend this kit to keep your freshwater fish safe. It does what it is supposed to do reliably and you can't expect anything more than that.
This kit is super easy to use. All of the bottles are labeled clearly and have a childproof lid. The kit includes a guide to help you correct dangerous levels. Clueless as to what to do for a high nitrate level? The guide included tells you how to correct the problem, keep in mind it may require adding a product to your tank that is not included in the kit. It also includes test tubes for testing water levels. The directions are easy to follow and can be stored in the kit if you keep the lid. It also has a long shelf life. I have had several of these kits and as long as I have fish I will continue to use this product.
I love this test kit!  Fast and easy - it's trivial to use if you aren't afraid of pipetting (e.g. high school chemistry).  Bottles are clearly marked with instructions for each type of test.  Color chart makes reading results easy. Only complaint - the test tubes that come with it are fairly small, and there's really no included way of getting tank water into the tubes (unless you like to just dip the tubes right into the tank, which I like to avoid).  I bought a set of glass test tubes with a rack and a graduated pipette with pipette pump to make things easier - now I can test pH (low and high range), ammonia, nitrite, nitrate in about 5 minutes flat.  And for the money you really do get hundreds of tests - I test weekly and after 6 months still have plenty of reagents left!
I love API and all their products. Aquarium salt is an essential tool on hand for an aquarist to treat some basic fish diseases. (never use table salt!)Just remember to do your research before treating your animals with any kind of 'fix'. I see a few reviews on here that demonstrate the wrong way to use Aquarium salt. It's not necessarily recommended you add it with regular water changes  - freshwater fish obviously don't need salt unless they're being treated for something. And when doing salt baths it's best to use a quarantine tank rather than treating your main aquarium.For a betta, don't use this as a treatment for bloating - it will block your betta up worse. Use an Epsom salt bath for that.
I have a number of five gallon freshwater tanks but of course they can use about a tablespoon of salt per tank.  Have used to cure fin rot.  My "technique" is to fill a five gallon jug with tap water.  Add one tablespoon of the salt and whatever else I need to put in there (stress coat, algae drops, etc.) let it stand overnight at least.  I siphon out a bit of water from each tank and replace with the water from the jug as needed.  This eliminates problem with having the salts dissolve and from my experience is just a good practice if you are dealing with tap water.In my case when used for fin rot I did daily water changes of about 1/3 the tank.  Having it pre-mixed keeps the consistency you need for each change and that definitely helps the fish.
I got my Python probably 20 years ago.  Pretty close to when they first came out, anyway.  The first pump cracked at the bottom, and I got a generic pump that later cracked at the top where it screws onto the faucet.  For the third one, I decided to go back to the name brand, hoping it would be more sturdy, and I was happily surprised to see that they've made the pump now with thicker plastic.  I can't see either the top or bottom part breaking under normal use now.I only took away 1 star for the fact that the design inherently tends to spray water out of the bottom under pressure (when filling the tank.)  I'm sure there must have been some design change they could have made to prevent that, like adding a rubber seal at the base.  Well, I just drape paper towels over it, like I have since the beginning.  (Other brands, btw, are all the same.)
This adapter screws into the faucet after you take the original adapter out--- mine was alerady removed since I use a water filter that screws onto it with a different adapter.And the python screws onto it without another part.I needed to get a replacement since the original part was missing so I was glad they sold one that is sturdy and long lasting.**** Note to any one buying one: the external thread was really sharp and I ended up cutting my thumb on it while trying to screw it onto the faucet the first time.  I work around this issues by using a papertowel/rag to put over the threads while screwing in or out and I haven't cut my thumb again since.  It helps give it the extrat grip on the adapter so you can screw it in better too.
If I had known that Python now ships with a brass adapter I wouldn't have ordered one - bowever it's always good to have a back up and I keep it for my tanks that are on a different level of the house.Python has been around for just about as long as I've been keeping fish which is over 35 years. I haven't used one in decades but decided to get a new one and check out the improvments. Not much has changed but the brass adapter is a major step up from the old plastic one. Those wouldn't last very long, the threads would strip away entriley after a few uses an the seal was never complete enough to stop water from spraying everyplace - but it STILL beat carrying around those buckets!This adpater is pretty universal and should fit most any faucet. Theres amale and female side, if you have a diffuser or water saver on your faucet simply remove it and pop this one in and you're good to go.
The faucet adapter this comes with is not universal and from what I've read, neither is the universal adapter they sell. Luckily the adapter fit the faucet that was further away than the one I had intended to use. My solution was to go to the hardware store and replace the short tube with a longer one.I didn't realize I was using it incorrectly the first few times. basically you press the big tube against the bottom slightly at an angle and move it around for the best results. it seems like it wastes a lot of water and an electric water pump would probably be more efficient but this allows you to safely clean the waste out of the gravel and do partial water changes with your fish in the tank.
This is a great product.  It does a super job making heavy buckets and spills a thing of the past.  Had no problem hooking it up to my bathroom sink and the operation from the tank to the sink and back, was effective and easy.  My main concern was putting untreated water from my sink into the aquarium as I refilled it.  I added my de-chlorination solution into the tank as I refilled.  My fish were no worse for the experience and should benefit from regular wter changes now that it will be so easy.  If you have a 50 gal tank or greater, you really need one of these.
I've always liked this setup to clean gravel and drain/fill my tank. The only problem with this is the awkward plastic nut that attaches to the sink. I don't know why they made it like this, but the more you screw it onto the sink, the more you loosen a part that lets water spray out. I can't figure it out, it's also hard to explain without physically showing it. My other gravel cleaner doesnt have the awkward fitting with this problem. I get it to work nonetheless.
This item works great. Make sure the fitting are all tight and the faucet connections are snug. I usually lay a wash cloth over the faucet fitting when filling just as a precaution. Yes it uses a lot of water because running water is what is used to create the siphon process. If you don't want to run water to siphon buy a hose type siphon and some buckets. I have a 75 gallon community tank and a 125 gallon discus tank and this device makes water changes much easier. I did sacrifice and old hose siphon to get a longer tube since the stock one was too short for my purpose.
We bought this to take care of our turtle tank.  As our turtles grew the water got worse and we had to change the water more often, and the bucket system was getting old...With this thing you just hook it up to your sink and like magic the water disappears!  We were heartbroken when we installed a new faucet in the kitchen which had no place for an adapter... But lo and behold, if you unscrew the brass adapter on the valve, it will screw onto a garden hose!  So now we just run the hose out a window and water the lawn while we're changing water.One tip for the people breaking their plastic parts... The rubber seals are what's going to keep the connections from leaking.  Stop tightening the valve just after you start to feel some resistance.  The rubber seal doesn't need that much pressure to seal up.  Don't overtighten the connection and you won't break it!
I have a 90 gallon & 36 gallon bowfront at home & needed something different to help clean & do water changes. This was the perfect item to do so. Very well constructed, fittings are tight, and plastic is extremely hard. The only issue i've had thus far, I have a Peerless water faucet on my kitchen sink and I couldn't quite get the attachment to screw on right, not sure if it was user error, or the threads are different? Works great on my outside hose though, watch the water pressure build up while your transferring the siphon tube to the tank to fill the tank back up, the pressure builds up quickly and if not released it could burst this tube! Granted I have about 90 psi in my city water. When I am cleaning my tank, I have sand substrate so it's not the easiest to clean with this since it sucks up so well, you'll have to turn on/off the flow if you've got sand. Overall a great product!
The best thing you can buy for a tank that's 20 gallons or more. I didn't think it would fit in my bathroom faucet because it doesn't have threads on either side of the washer, usually only kitchen faucets have threads, but when I got this kit in the mail, first thing I did was try to fit the brass connector on. All I did was take a rubber glove for grip to unscrew the current faucet adapter then screwed on the brass connector and it fits perfectly. Drains tanks in minutes, also fills tanks. The on/off valve, on the hose is awesome.
I just received my Python No Spill Clean and Fill system and I have to tell you what a diffrence it has made in cleaning my tank. I have a 55 gallon freshwater tank and it is well established and has very large fish. I used to dread cleaning and propper maintance due to the fact of using a bucket and killing my back. I was done in record time and not one drop on the floor. Will not use anything else now and will not dread waterchanges and vacuming the tank. Wish I would have found this years ago!
I own this product and I own the Aqueon equivalent.  Obviously, this type of product is a must for any serious aquarium owner, but the Python version of this hose is seriously crappy compared to the Aqueon.  The piece that connects to the faucet leaks and is not well built.  Just tonight I was cleaning my aquariums and the faucet piece broke in half while filling and sprayed water all over myself and my kitchen.  The Aqueon version has never leaked and is clearly better made.  I just wish my Aqueon was 50 foot instead of 25, as I'd definitely use it exclusively.
If you keep goldfish, the Python is a life saver. Goldies may be cute as buttons, but they're extremely messy. This product makes 50-60% weekly water changes on my 40 gallon simple and dare I say, enjoyable. It hooked to my sink easily, there were no spills on the floor, no lugging around buckets (&lt;&lt;heck yes!), and it cut my tank cleaning/water change time in half. It's well made too - I feel like it will last awhile. What more can I say? It's great. Highly recommend and would purchase again. I won't be putting off water changes anymore (my two fishies say thanks!).Also, it arrived WAY early, which is a huge plus. Props to the seller for quick shipping.
I love this device, I was a little hesitant at first because I was afraid of adding the prime by volume into the tank but it hasn't mattered at all.If you're worried about adding prime put your mind to ease...I add the total volume amount in the back of the tank as I add the water and it works great! A lot of the chlorine is evaporating as it is blow through the tube any way.I bought an extra 10' of hose and it works out nicely because I have tanks all over the house and sometimes only need 10'. I don't understand some of the negative reviews, it is a little spendy but this type hose isn't cheap either.If used as instructed this product is fantastic. I was getting a back ache from hauling buckets, to four different tanks...this is so much easier! I can't believe I went without one for so long!
I think I would of ended my hobby if it weren't for this little device.  So much time wasted lugging bucket after bucket to 3 very large tanks was wearing me down. For that reason my tanks became a little neglected.Now this beautiful glorious tool has made my hobby soo soo much enjoyable.  LOVE IT!!!  Now water changes and cleaning time is greatly reduced to about 40 mins with 3 50 gallon tanks, before 3 hours or more and messy water spills on the floor.  This system is GREAT!! did I mention I LOVE IT!!  Suction is good. Easy to use and put away.  I am soo very happy. I now love my tanks more than ever and actually look forward to giving them fresh 25% change every week. They love it. Happy fish, happy fish owner.I give it 10 stars.. If you have a large tank, you have to get one of these. You wont be sorry.
Don't make things difficult for yourself -- Buying a Python will make cleaning/filling/draining your tank a pleasure. The connections are all solid with no annoying drips to deal with, and priming is a breeze with the faucet connection to your sink.You can even buy extensions to get the hose to wherever you need it.The Python is quality craft, and they also stand by their product 100%. They replaced a hose and connection for me a year ago on a Python that was 5 years old -- NO CHARGE/UPS DELIVERY.
Bought a similar product at the local Pet store and it broke on first use. When I saw the fittings on this one, I knew instantly that it is better quality. Only used it twice so far but with the proper care, I think I'll be getting good use out of it.The only peace that doesn't induce a lot of comfort is the release valve (green T piece) that you have to pull in order to enable or disable suction. It works for now but I wish it was a brass fitting as well so I can yank on it without having to worry.Better than the in-store product, so I recommend this.
This product works very well and includes the upgraded brass faucet connector. I like my fish tank but hated to have to haul buckets. A couple things I have done, the connections on the &#34;pump&#34; and the hose are hose thread (garden hose). I put a quick connect fitting on the hose and the pump so I dont have to try to thread that on anymore, same with the brass faucet adapter and top of pump, but I had them laying around.Also I wrap the pump with a piece of foil. The first time i used it i pulled on the hose a bit and it loosened up the faucet connection and I didn't see water spraying all over the bathroom. Takes a second and is cheap insurance and I just keep reusing the same piece of foil.
I currently have a 55 gallon African cichlid aquarium and 16 gallon bowfront community fish aquarium. I do water changes every couple days for my 55 gallon aquarium replacing about 15 gallons at a time. I've only used the Python Maintenance System a few times because I don't leave the hose constantly connected to the faucet, so using my 5 gallon Home Depot buckets are a lot more convenient. Also, the suction isn't that strong with the hose, so it takes longer than using buckets. Like most fish people, I want another, bigger tank and may use it at that time. I recommend this for people who either have trouble lifting the buckets, have a lot of tanks, or have large tanks that require a lot a buckets.
This is useful for pumping out and refilling water. But the faucet leaks. Like other reviews say, this thing waste a lot of water when trying to pump out water from the tank. You've to have your sink's water running in order to pump. So I usually use the sink's faucet to pump water from the tank, and I stopped it. And drag the tube out the door. It's a hassle, but I don't want to waste that much water. And after refilling water to the tank, I tried to remove the remaining water from the tube, and the water moves soooooo slow. This thing can only change water and refill, but it is needy. It saves back pain,
Does not kink Rolls back up easily. The auto-siphon doesnt work well via the faucet adapter if you are draining from a lower point but thats obvious - many people like to drain from both the display and refugium. I just let gravity do the work instead of adding another adapter to my faucet. The valve is nice and works well. The plastic siphon to faucet adapter is cheap but i havent seen a kit like this that wasnt cheap plastic. Bottom-line is the part that needs to work does it right, doesnt kink youll be happy with the purchase.
Having multiple tanks for over 30 years anthing that makes the tasks of water changes and refills is a welcome relife. No more carrying buckets and the Python is a real time saver.The adapter has been uopgraded to brass over plastic so the fit is much better but you'll still get some spray on high water pressure so just cover the back part of the faucet with a towel. I drained a 55 in about 30 minutes which is pretty decent time and my back thanks me.Perfect for multiple water changes, simply treat the water in the tank - I've been using Prime by Seachem for years and swear by it. On the weak side - the hose is very soft and pliable making it easy to kink. In addition the connections ALL leak and spray so again, a little plumbers tape goes a long way. But these small headaches aside the Python is a superb method to use in the care of your tanks.
Hard to mess up a floating square. It does contain the food.Negatives....to me at least:The post that attaches it to the side is 2 1/2&#34; long. This puts it far from the corner.Overall size float size is 5&#34;L x 4 1/4&#34;W. Pretty large.Inside float dimensions are approx. 4&#34;L x 3&#34;W.This ring could be reduced by a third or half. The foam material does support algae and is quite visible unless you keep the water level up to the black trim.I'm used to a simple 3&#34; x 3&#34; clear plastic ring with trapped air floats. This type stays in the corner with the surface tension of the water.All in all I'll use it but wouldn't buy another due to the size.
This is my second go-around buying this product.  The 1st one broke at the joint that connects the two panes of glass after about only 1 year.  Now to be honest I don't completely blame the manufacturer.  I'm subjecting them to a good amount of heat.  I'm using them for African Spur Thigh Tortoises and tend to keep the terrarium temperature at around 80-95 degrees.  I'm sure that has contributed to their premature deterioration.  On the other hand they fit perfectly on the tank with very little loss of heat.  I would recommend this product, but if you're using it like I do just expect to replace it in about a year.
This looks a lot better than the traditional black plastic tops - more light also is allowed in.  I think it is slightly too deep though as I have trimmed it as much as I can and it is about a 1/4&#34; too big so that when I open it I have to hold it open (It doesn't stay open) to feed the fish.  Also the sticky glue gel used to hold the handle out has already given way, so I need to get an adhesive to replace that.It was a good price though and it arrived undamaged.  Overall, I still like it better than the black plastic tops.
I guess for the price I shouldn't complain much but the glass on my top was not cut straight. A very obvious curve was on the side of the glass and so I had to force the top down into my aquarium's rim. This probably wasn't a smart thing to do on my part but I'm not going to waste time shipping the item back and wait another week or more for a replacement. The glass also slips out of the plastic piece that allows it to be opened, possibly falling into the tank.
Fit my 29 gallon (30" Long, 12" Wide, 18" High) just right. The two glass pieces came already inserted into the plastic piece that allows the glass to be lifted for feeding. The other extra plastic piece goes onto the rear glass piece in case you have filters in the back and need to cut slots out for them. However, i don't use that plastic piece, and have a inch and a half space that fits well for my filter and heater. It also comes with an attachable handle that makes it easier to lift the glass.
I bought this top for my 30-gallon tall aquarium which, for some reason, did not come with a cover, though I was slightly suspicious it may not fit.Luckily, I worried in vain. This lid fits perfectly and I love it. The back half can be cut to fit your setup of heaters and filters while the rest is sturdy glass. You have to glue on the handle yourself, which I thought was interesting and did with absolutely no issues and I liked being able to customize the location of the handle. There is a hinge in the glass that allows it to be opened and closed easily.It looks a lot nicer then the black plastic dome tops that most aquariums come with, and it is nice to be able to see through the top of the aquarium. I would like to eventually replace the black plastic fixture on my other aquarium with this as well.
I didn't understand how much water I was losing because of evaporation until I put this think on a couple of weeks ago. I used to have to put nearly a gallon of water in every week or so. But, after I this top and the LED lighting kit I'm saving a ton of water (and subsequently treatment chemicals) and time. And, because I do not have to retreat the water every time I add a gallon, my water is staying far more stable. I'd look into buying the LED light bar too. I've been thrilled with the combo.Marineland Single Bright LED Lighting System 24-36-Inch
This product does the job, but I am a little irritated by the cut of the glass being kind of amateurish.  One of the glass edges has a small pit and if you look closely you can see that it was cut very coarsely and not smoothed.  When I look at the parts involved, I would rather just by the plastic hing and the trimable plastic seal on the back and just get my own glass cut.  Those parts are probably worth 1 dollar.  In fact, now that I have them, I may just get my own glass cut and have features like slightly rounded edges instead of sharp corners
PRO:-my dogs (maltese and poodle mix) go crazy over these treats. they are very obedient once they know that i'm holding these treats in my hand-since they're freeze dried, i don't have to worry about these treats drying out-although it comes in big cubes, i'm able to cut the cubes into smaller pieces with a plastic knife in order to lengthen the usage out of my stash of these dog treats-my containers always came with very little crumbs/powder at the container's bottomCON:-not uniform sizes-not cheapConclusion: still a great product, but need some modifications*Since every morsel appears to be so flavorful, all my dogs need is a pinkie nail size amount to reward them.*It may SEEM like the crumbs/powder is useless, but actually, it is still somewhat useful. I used the powder to coat bland chewy dog treats, dog food, toys, etc.
I have purchased this item frequently over the years but this time the liver bits were fractured and mostly too small to handle. Using treats for dog training requires bits that can be held in the hand and fed. If they are too big or too small it is hard or impossible to work it. Perhaps I got a bad batch but about 20% of the container was "powder" while another 30% was too small to hold. About half the bin was useful. Win some, lose some. This was a loss.
I would say this was worth the price, but I probably won't buy it again.  If you mind cooking up meat treats and/or you mind smelling like a barbecue when you carry the treat bag around, this might be worth a try.  Me, I like cooking and smelling like dinner.Pros:Dog will eat the treatsWill keep in your pocket or treat bag without going bad and stinkingCons:Not as high-value as non-freeze-dried meat/liver (my guess is this doesn't have as strong a smell as fresh, so it's not as attractive a treat)More expensive than buying bulk liver yourself and roasting it
Freeze dried liver is used by many dog handlers in the show ring.  It doesn't screw up your clothes the way string cheese does.  DOGS LOVE IT !!  Only one problem the chunks are all different sizes from About 3/8&#34; Sq. down to almost dust.  BUT you don't have to waste the scraps, just toss it in their regular food.  It would be nice, however, if they were all a uniform size.  These are about the cheapest I have found.  Five stars for price, convenience and dog's acceptance.  Four stars for crumbling (in transit?)
I stay with this brand because others (Beefeaters, notably) have switched their sourcing to China...Beefeaters' treats are now compressed squares of (alleged) powdered beef liver imported from China.  Now, I don't know how many readers have a lot of Chinese friends, but mine all say no self-respecting Chinese would use good liver this way...so...is this from dessicated liver 'rejects'?  Is it really beef?  Is it really liver?  Are there additives?  I don't need to remind most readers that Chinese factories added melamine to pet food protein, infant powdered milk, and other foodstuffs.  Do I trust foodstuffs imported from China?  Doh...nooooo.  My dogs love these treats, which look and feel like real dried liver.  Beware--they can/do cause loose bowels if the dog eats too many (keep the container on a high shelf!)
I use these as a training treat when I am working with my two dogs. My dogs were getting bored of the same ol' treats even though I tried to give them a wide variety. This one BY FAR is their favorite, and I like it because its all natural with no preservatives. Some of the pieces are pretty big, but easily broken with your finger nail. If you carry some around in your pocket like I do when I'm working with them, watch out - you will have the neighborhood dogs wanting a treat too.  :) The price here is quite good also. It is definitly worth a try!
He LOVES dehydrated liver.  I make it for him all the time, so I thought he'd love THIS, too, and it would be good when/if I didn't have my homemade dehydrated ready.  I bought two big containers and he won't touch it!  I ended up giving it away. I think it's the freeze drying process.  Dehydrating keeps the flavor better.  Have YOU ever eaten freeze dried food?  I have and it tasted awful. So, it you want to try this, get a small bag first, so you don't waste your money like I did.
Dogs love these treats more than any other treats I've ever found.  In situations where other treats fail to get our dog's attention -Charlee Bear Turkey Liver & Cranberry Flavored Dog Treats, for example - these treats are impossible for her to ignore.  They are an incredible training aid.Big bonus is that they're also simple and good for the dog.  Liver is a healthy treat and is supposed to help combat weepy eyes.  Unlike most other commercial treats, this one isn't loaded with a bunch of other junk that isn't good for your dog (byproducts and the like), it's just a good ingredient that your dog will love.
I have been a fan of freeze dried liver for training for YEARS! Stewart is the ONLY one I trust... Other brands of &#34;training treats&#34; like Bil-Jack contain a host of ingredients and by-products. Stewart is 100% freeze dried liver. Is it pricey? Yes... but worth every penny. The chunks are big, so for training puppies, I simply take a cube and a paring knife and slice them into four or five slices and then each slice into quarters... you don't need much to make your pup listen to you. The scent is strong and tiny pieces are quite enough to get the job done. A little effort makes for a big pay off. If the cubes came smaller, they would probably disintegrate during shipping, so I don't mind cutting them up for training sessions! Well worth the investment in your dog, and your relationship with your furry little one!
This product is a real bargain, considering the fact that dogs love liver. I've used this as an addition to another dog treat product I use for my dog. My dog goes nuts when he knows that he's about to be rewarded withPro-Treat Beef Liver treats. The instructions advise to give 2-3 pieces per day when using. At this rate, the container will last you a good while. The product itself is very fresh and the pieces are all of various sizes and thickness. Average size of treat is small rectangular pieces of different thickness. They're easy to break into smaller pieces if necessary. My Springer Spaniel pup is 5 months old and he just loves these. I tried this product on my girlfriend's 10 yr old teacup Poodle, who is pretty slow at this point in her life. She absolutely came to life and jumped all over the place for a taste of one of these treats. Buy it....your dog will love it!
Every dog we have ever offered these treats to has gone NUTS for them. Even some of our most senior dogs who are picky about what they will eat and will turn up their noses at things most other dogs would love. Multiple sizes (the pieces are not uniformly cut) but most pieces break apart into smaller pieces if needed for smaller dogs. The &#34;dust&#34; in the bottom of the tub is very well received when sprinkled over meals - our dogs never get tired of this stuff. Neat, secure snapping plastic tub that can be washed out and reused is a bonus. Wash hands after handling and be aware that these treats do kinda stink - part of the attraction, I'm sure. Excellent value and very happy dogs.
I went through a few other brands of training treats in my day - but I would stand behind Stewart's before any others.  simple, freeze dried liver... no additives, minimal calories means I can give many a day to satisfy my training needs.I do cut these up into about 1/3 size for my puppy initially, means I can give him 3X more per day then what is recommended and again, is great for the constant reward system of new dog training.Just saw they have a Pork flavor released too - looking forward to trying it in the next order!
My vet uses these as treats to give to the dogs, which is where I noticed that he absolutely loved them.  He would let them poke and prod him if he thought he'd get one of these, so I had to get some for home.  Now, when I notice he's not behaving well before a walk, I'll keep some in my pockets while we're out and he listens very well.  He's constantly heeling when I do this (most likely because his nose is very near my pocket).
Just like they say in the clicker-training instructions, you must have the IMMEDIATE ultimate reward for the good behavior. I looked for an AMERICAN SOURCED liver treat product and this is great. I was VERY concerned that I not be buying Chinese liver, for obvious reasons of the health of my precious dogs. This stuff comes in rather large chunks that I am cutting into 1/3rds and keeping in a treat pouch, and it is ASTOUNDING to me how quickly my puppies are learning behaviors with the use of a clicker and this reward. I can tell I will be buying many buckets of this, glad to have something that I know will let the dogs know they did what I wanted. It does not crumble apart, and has no discernible scent, though I would recommend a treat pouch over trying to keep it in a clothing pocket.
Not really, but I couldn't resist the gag.  There are tons of other reviews, so I will just add that this is a great product, and you should try it.  I've used it for 18 years or so.  A smaller size package at first will tell all.  I always buy the more economical big tubs now for my pair of 40-lb dogs, since they love these great treats.  I cut the pieces into smaller, consistent sizes.  The dust and dregs are sprinkled on their food occasionally, either on food they might not like, or to make preferred foods more special.  Our only problem is limiting the number of dried liver treats to the recommended amount, since the dogs love them so much.
We cut these up into small pieces for our Corgi pup (so each treat actually becomes 8-10 mini treats) to prevent throwing off his diet.  This allows us to give him multiple treats for going potty outside (like 3-5 mini treats each time).  We also use these whenever our puppy meets a stranger -- we make sure all four paws are on the ground before we give it to him and he has already learned to inhibit his desire to jump up on people!  These are amazing and I appreciate that they are made in the USA -- no weird chemicals to worry about -- and our pup loves to work for them!
Getting grain free treats for training usually leaves three options: hard biscuits (and who wants to work for those?), cooked meat (which is gross to handle), or commercial meaty grain-free treats which cost an arm and a leg.These on the other hand, are very affordable, not gross to handle, and the dogs think they smell AMAZING.  They work great when your dog's attention is wavering - a waff of freeze dried beef liver usually snaps them back to attention!Also, being as they're only beef liver, I don't feel bad feeding my dog as many as needed for training.Highly recommended.
My dogs love these... either straight up, or crumbled on food they would otherwise not eat.  They don't get sick of them and almost never ever reject them.  They do quite often reject other treats, and certainly after a while of the same other treats.  But then tend to always enjoy these. In fact, I have to be careful not to over feed them these because I don't know if they are healthy to eat in quantity.  Certainly not for my wallet.  They do last a LONG time though, especially compare to their weight.  However, dogs wolf them down quite quickly.  I highly recommend you reward you doggies with some!
The main problem with this product is that the treat pieces are very big. I have to break them with my hands (or sometimes cut them) to make them small enough to use as training treats. If they were small enough, they'd be great training treats because they are so cheap. However, I don't think they're as suitable as non-training treats, mainly because I have much better quality treats for my dog that he enjoys a lot more.I haven't found much use for these dried liver treats... the tub has been sitting there for several months and is still practically full.
I have two dogs, an Aussie Shepherd/Australian Cattle Dog Cross, and a Chihuahua/Pomeranian Cross.  The little Chi has a sensitive stomach so I have to be careful what he eats.  Both dogs love these treats and the little guy has no problem eating them at all, unlike many other dog treats/food I have purchased and then I have to throw them in the trash.  I see these Stewart Freeze Dried Liver treats are US made of US inspected beef liver with no preservatives or additives which made me decide to try them with my dogs (I won't purchase foreign made food/treats since my parent's dog became seriously ill a few years ago with the melamine contaminated dog food from China).  My first test of being locally made was met, and the dogs gave them the second test which was whether they liked them or not.  Since they clearly love them, I will be buying more of these treats and I would recommend them to other dog owners to give them a try.
I've been using these for my puppy with training and he absolutely loves them.The only inconvenience I find is that, while each piece varies greatly in size, they are pretty large.  So, I cut them up into pieces appropriate to the size practical for training.  Each time he gets one it is just a little piece, and that works great.Since I do cut them up, I don't find these to be expensive at all because they really go a long way.The other important thing is the list of ingredients.  They are not full of junk.  In fact, there is NO junk in them.  Just beef liver.  I like that, as I really try to know that I'm giving him good quality foods and treats.
These are a great deal when compared to the small bags of treats available at the pet store. More importantly, my dog adores them. I use them as an extra special treat, usually just for when he goes into his crate. As soon as he notices that I have one in my hand, he runs to his crate and waits, tail wagging. The only downside is that the liver cubes smell horrible (to humans, anyway) and leave a powdery residue behind. But as some other reviews have noted, the powder is great for sprinkling on dry food for a finicky dog.
My dog trainer recommended this to our obedience class. I found the best price here on Amazon, and my puppy LOVES the treats. Great training treats if used in moderation (too much organ meat isn't good for anyone). Also excellent if you put some of the treats in a container with non-liver treats/cookies. Use the container as a shaker to help train your dog to come, and the other treats get a liver flavored (dust) coating that makes your dog love them even more! No limit on liver dusted treats!Two paws up for this stuff!
These treats are 100% beef liver--nothing else. You can't ask for anything healthier than that! Just don't overfeed them. They're treats, not food. Remember that. Your dog would prefer you forget that distinction, because he will love them that much. If you have a small white dog you are probably familiar with the red eye stains. Most people don't know that adding liver to their diet every day will get rid of that ugly stain. Don't exceed the recommended amount. The stain that's already there won't go away, it will have to grow out and be trimmed away by your groomer. But in a few weeks you should notice that white hair is growing in at the base of the old stains.
This is the light I use for my red-eared slider (an aquatic turtle).  She's a foot long and lives in a heated 120-gallon aquarium.  She loves basking under this light and it really helps keeps her shell nice and healthy by allowing her to completely dry off as she soaks up the rays and warmth.  I keep it on for 12 hours each day but it lasts quite a long time, long enough that I can never even remember the last time I had to change it.
I only rated this product as being OK because it is more of a starter bulb for your reptile until you can get the Powersun bulb. This was the first bulb that I purchased. I used it in the Zoo Med Double Dome lamp fixture during the day-time, along with the 75 watt infrared bulb at night. During this time, I had to dust my box turtle's food with the vitamin D3 Repti Calcium to make sure that she did not develop Metobolic bone disease. It is best to go ahead and get the Powersun bulb if your reptile will be an indoor pet. If you cannot get the Powersun bulb at the time that you get your reptile, just make sure that you get the Powersun bulb within the next two weeks.
I have this over my fiddler crab tank. It's a 10 gallon. It keeps the tank between 73-80, even if it's down to 64F in the house. Of course, I also have a heater in the water (fiddlers use both water and land) so that also helps with the temp. I would use something with more wattage though, if you have a bigger tank. I've had the light for about 3 weeks now, and have had no problems, but time will tell.
I have the Zoo Med Double Dome lamp. I use this bulb as a night-time heating source for my box turtle, in conjunction with the 100 watt, Powersun bulb during the day-time. I never turn on both bulbs at once because that would be too much. I have seen my turtle come out and bask on her log as needed while this bulb is on, so I guess she is happy with it. I have had the bulb (and the turtle) for six months. I have had no issues with this bulb so far.
Nice, but perhaps bigger than I need. When placed along the long side of the small aquarium I have, the hook brings the light almost to the far side of the aquarium, rather than near the same side as the stand. Perhaps moving it to the narrow side instead and on the opposite end of the aquarium from where it's needed, the arm will extend long enough so that the light will be where it's needed. But then the cord needs to be strung up more awkwardly for my setup.  My problem, really, not the product's.The stand seems sturdy and designed well. There are clips to hold the cord, but they seem to be made of a metal that isn't particularly springy, so they have to be bent in just enough to grasp the cord, otherwise it tends to slip out. I haven't yet figured out that perfect tension--or perhaps the clips can't maintain it because of the weak metal.
Simple and does it's job. But for my use it extends a little too far out. It would be nice if the arm was about the length of the width of a typical lamp housing for those who need the lamp closer to an edge then the center of the terrarium.Simply made, but not really CHEAPLY made. But they could have put a little more into coating the product as mine has already began to chip from adjusting it's height. Would also be nice to have more user friendly and adjustable cable ties/anchors.
The metal arms are solid, so is the base, but I don't know why the holes in the metal arms aren't pre drilled to accept the twist screws. It was also perplexing why the one arm was round instead of square, at least the square arms have better grip/traction for the crews. Also mine came with no instructions, and in general came very unprofessionally packed. For awhile I though I had gotten a used/refurbished unit. Also would be better if the wire loop/hook on their deep dome lamp was wider to actually sit in the hook of the lamp stand rather then sit on top of it.
I have an awesome powerful HOB filter system but it kept sucking up fry and killing snails. I even tried the fry protectors off of another site which didn't kill fry but somehow managed to kill 4 of my mystery snails. I wasn't sure if this would work or even fit but I bought it anyway. This is hands down, the BEST solution out there. It is big so if you have a smaller tank (say 30 gallons or less) it will take up some space. I have a 50 gallon and it works perfect. No more changing out fry gaurds due to debris getting caught. This doesn't clog or slow my water flow and I'm currently using between 2 filters almost 1,000 GPH. I have several snails and fry in my tank so I need extra help. You cannot go wrong with this!!
This prefilter fits to any aquaclear filter you can get. It's very helpful so that you don't really have to unplug your filter since only really tiny tidbits can get through the pores to get into the filter. I recommend rinsing it in some of your leftover water from a water change to keep it 'fresh' to keep the bacteria in. If this is for a new filter, leave it in for a month to get all the bacteria you need on it and if you want, it says that as long as it's been in a tank for 2 months, you can put it in a  new tank to a new filter to establish it immediately.
I have a 55gal planted and dirted tank with small fish, fry, shrimp and a lot of snails. This sponge keeps them from being sucked up into the filter. It is a pain to clean these because if you turn the filter off the gunk stuck to it back flows into the tank, so heres what I do: I take a ziplock bag and place it over the filter sponge then quickly turn off the filter so when the dirt releases the heavy stuff stays in the bag. Then I undo the actual filter &#34;pipe&#34; that its attached to, and remove the whole section. I wash the filter sponge from there. I do not notice any change in flow when using this prefilter when its clean, but of course when it gets gunked up it does impede water flow.
The Filter-Max III Pre Filter was a great buy. I use it as a pre filter on my Aqueon HOB filter. The Filter-Max helps keep the filter clean and allows me to extent the period of time between filter rinses and cartridge changes. This in turn really lets the biological filtration establish itself both in the filter and on the sponge.I like the Filter-Max so much that I have purchased another for my Penguin 200...the only challenge with that will be matching the round pre filter to the rectangular intake on the HOB filter...but I will figure it out!
I slightly overdose this on every water change for all of my tanks, I have over half a dozen bettas, tons of live plants, and several varieties of catfish who are notoriously sensitive to water parameters, and I never have issues.I've never had an issue, despite having hard water and so much chlorine I can smell it. I let the water sit for only a few minutes usually after a stir of prime in.I like to also add StressZyme+ to help keep the weird slime off all of my substrate, plants, and rocks.I prefer SeaChem Prime over any other!I do recommend the small bottle if you keep only a 20g or under as you really wont need more than a 1/4 of a capful for every 5g bucket. It lasts forever.Works wonderfully as "oh s***" ammonia/nitrite/nitrate savers, as well.
I bought this to test out the product, much better than the crap tetra brand I'd used before.  1 ml per gallon of water for de-chlorinating so getting a litter bottle to last a while, don't have to shake before use, and at least for me, doesn't smell bad.  I use a small needless syringe with ml/cc marked to easily dose.  Can be used to de-tox ammonia or nitrite but takes a larger dosage per gallon.Will be buying the 2 liter size to last me a longer bit.
Pretty much the gold standard for dechlorinator. Added benefit of detoxifying ammonia. Note, it is only detoxified for 24-48 hours. It is not removed, it is made harmless to fish. I currently do daily dosing to be safe. Bacteria and plants can still use it in the detoxified state, so it does not stall a nitrogen cycle. Emergency nitrite dosing is also a great feature, but do not depend on that to save your fish during the cycle. Do a fishless cycle, do it right.
I have quite a few tanks ranging from 5 gallons to 65 gallons. Our local water supply likes to juice up the lines with ammonia every now and then to clean them. This much to my dismay almost killed my entire tank of breeder cichlids. This stuff is way better than anything out there and keeps it all humming along happily with the oodles of water changes I do.I've used them all...this works best and I notice the least amount of disruption to the cycle of the tank and the overall happiness of the fish.
Must have product for all aquariums!!! The label / bottle might not look as appealing as other branded aquarium pharmaceuticals (ie. TetraFin etc.) but the product works wonders. One thing for sure is, when using this product you might show false positives in your test kits, however, do not be alarmed if you see high Ammonia / Trite / Trate readings, this product simply detoxes these for up to 24-48 hours to make it safe for fish. To get proper readings, just perform water changes weekly.Just as a tip, I use Prime to help me with my fish in cycles.NOTE: FISHLESS CYCLES ARE ALWAYS RECOMMENDED, IT IS LESS CRUEL FOR THE FISH AND WILL GIVE YOU AN ADDED BENEFIT OF FULLY STOCKING AN AQUARIUM.
The things Seachem Prime can do are amazing. I highly recommend this product for anyone in fishkeeping as it is a great dechlorinator that also changes any ammonia in the tank to its non-toxic form. I have been using it during my fish-in cycle and everybody is doing very well. The concentrated nature is also really useful, as this 100mL bottle lasted me as long for my 20g (including daily half doses) as a regular dechlorinator did for a 2g.I do recommend getting pipettes or some other way to use a dropper. Dose 2 drops/gal for dechlorination/adding new water. Dose 1 drop/gal daily until ammonia disappears for fish-in cycling.
I have tried several items to keep my tanks in balance due to the very high ph (8.4) that comes out of our faucets. This is the only product that has ever been able to keep my ph down and stable. Ever since I started using this about 2 years ago my fish have never been happier (several even started breeding on a regular basis now that the water parameters were correct). All I do is add this to my tanks when I do a water change and it makes the tap water safe and balances the ph level for me.
Neutral Regulator adjusts pH to neutral (pH 7.0) from either a low or high pH and maintains it there.It removes any chlorine, chloramine or ammonia, making other conditioning chemicals unnecessary; which, saves me time and money!Neutral regulator is the only water-conditioning product I will use.If you want to lower the pH below 7.0 you can use Seachem's Neutral Regulator with Acid Regulator or Discus Buffer; or to raise pH above 7.0 you can use with Alkaline Regulator.Seachem has terrific products for all kinds of aquarium needs.I've been depending on Seachem products for healthy aquariums for 15 years.Now, I buy the large sizes! :)
While this stuff is a bit on the pricey end to get started I have found that it does in fact add an extra visible filtering boost to my tank. The regeneration process is not very expensive and extends the life of the purgien as well. This contain comes with the purigen loose and requires a purchase of &#34;The Bag&#34; to hold the media as most other bags are not woven small enough to not let the media slip through. I have a single turtle and a few guppies in my tank and found that I had to run more purigen than recommended to see a difference. I'm currently keeping 350ml in my 55 gallon tank at any given time and there is a noticeable difference in water clarity.
My water in my tank has never been so good.  It is clear and the fish are healthy.  I was having a lot of trouble and losing fish.  I put this in the filters and, along with regular partial water changes, I have had a stable tank for many months now.  I don't understand the chemistry, but I can follow direction.  I have recharged it a couple times, too.  That worked well.Make sure you don't use StressCoat stuff with this as it will render it useless.  Get Seachem's Prime instead.  I use several Seachem products and they all seem to be great.
i had smaller tanks with a small bioload.  it gave my fish finrot. in the other tank i didnt have it in there as long and the finrot isnt as bad.didnt have issues before adding purigen.i tested my water and it was fine. it seems that whatever it did to my water, there wasnt a test for it.my once beautiful fish are now raggy ;[maybe just get this stuff if you have a big bioload and a messy tank.i just wanted a filter media that i wouldnt have to keep repurchasing.this is an expensive purchase for me since i've bought the purigen and several extra bags for it.
Seachem Purigen 100% Excellent.Excellent product, has come fast and super fast timePerforms work perfectly for Marine Aquariums and Sweets. Purchase a bag and add only necessary according to the number of liters of your aquarium and place in a recirculation pump (in my case Cascada) ufsss. trabjo doing very well.When changes color (brown) and dark can replace or just clean the aquarium water look a container (1 liter) leaves the bag to soak and add 10 drops of PRIME. for 24 hours. ready again to pump ..Easy, simple and uncomplicated. perform their measurements of ammonium, nitrite and NITRATE with API test
Its supposed to be a good filtration product, but make sure you use it with the same manufacturers water conditioner.  When combined with several common chlorine remover/water conditioners it produces chlorine in great amounts.  I tried this in a test tank that was going pretty well and it killed 3 of the 4 fish before I figured out what was wrong, and it happened in just a few hours.Otherwise the concept is good...the product shlorks up organic waste and when it turns black you soak it in bleach which kills off everything it sucked up, and then you treat it with the chlorine remover sold by the same company, then its good to absorb bad stuff for another month or two.  Just be careful to research which chemicals you're using and make sure they wont cause harm.
These amazing beads really clean up my aquarium tank to a clear crystal quality.  It would be nice though if the manufacturer had included instructions on how to clean and recycle the beads (I had to call customer service to find out).  Also a pouch to put this stuff in would be nice.  Tried it with my wife's old nylon panty hose; after several uses, the nylon breaks up due to the bleaching agent required for cleaning.  Overall though, the product is truly amazing.  I gave up using charcoal filter altogether.  Your fish will be happy too.
We have had a 38 gallon cichlid tank for awhile now.  We keep losing fish.  A friend gave us a 46 gallon tank and we decided to move the cichlids to the bigger tank.  We decided that this time, we were going to do it right.  We used cichlid sand and this cichlid salt.  When we went to test the water before putting the fish in, everything was right on.  The first 6 fish have been in the new tank for 5 days now and are doing well.  No casualties from the move, and their colors are so much brighter.  Our orange fish is bright neon now, and the yellow fish are so much brighter, too!  In another 5 days or so, we'll add the rest of the cichlids to the new tank.  I'm so glad that we bought this salt.
I've seen a marked increase in plant growth since adding Flourish to my tanks. I had several valisnerias that were alive and looking well, but not really actively growing. A few weeks after starting on Flourish they took off and started growing like wild. Now part of that could be them finally settling in and getting their roots established, but I'm pretty sure the Flourish also played a role in the enhanced growth. I'm dosing with Flourish twice a week (Wednesdays and Saturdays) and using Flourish Excel for carbon supplementation on a daily basis and all of my plants are doing very well.
I use this product 2 days a week following the recommended dosing instructions on Seachems website. Sunday following a water change and Friday the day before a water change. I'm not sure dosing the day before a water change makes much sense but according to Seachem their products are absorbed by the plants pretty quickly.I decided to give it a try and so far my plants are doing just fine. I will note that I'm not exactly giving these plants the best conditions to thrive (Sand, no Co2, Low light) but with the use of these Seachem products I've managed to keep them alive with some growth at that. It was my objective to grow these plants under this situation and so far I've succeeded. (2 months in)I do have small fish (Guppies), Dwarf Shrimp, and snails and none of them seem bothered by this product.
For anyone confused, this is a source of micro-nutrients for a tank.  This, by itself, is not a comprehensive plant supplement.  I personally use this in conjunction with dry N,P,&K; for a comprehensive fertilizing regime.  If you choose to use dry maco-nutrients, I suggest you dose them on different days.  There is potential interaction between the chemicals.I dose this using a small squeeze dropper bottle.  For my tank (9 Gal) I use 8 drops of this every other day.  By using a small dropper bottle I can keep most of the solution in cold storage to extend it's life.This is an easy and quick way to dose all your required micro-nutrients.
I have been using Flourish root tabs for the past few years and they work quite well when growing plants in asand substrate.The sand offers little in the way of nutrients, however, offers an excellent medium for plants to root themselves in.As such, adding some fertilizer root tabs to the sand substrate in an aquarium will help to ensure that your plants are receiving the nutrients they need to grow and remain healthy.I usually like to purchase the 40 count box from Flourish, because it's a much better value than the 10 count.  However, I have only been able to find it on Amazon.comA great product for the aquarist who likes growing plants in their aquarium.
This is a great fertilizer tab for use with planted aquariums (growing live aquatic plants); Products like this are a must if you're using inert substrate (gravel, sand, or blasting grit). I used these Flourish Tabs and had good results: All my root-feeding plants perked up.HOWEVER, the reason I say 3 stars out of 5 is because of the price!! For how tiny these tabs are, they are way too expensive for me. I have a 72 gallon bowfront tank and I can't possibly afford this name-brand product long term. ++whisper++ I'll tell you what I use instead....I buy this product:Size "OO" Empty gel capsules (1,000 qty)[...]and fill it with this product:Osmocote 2722501 Outdoor & Indoor Smart-Release Plant Food[...]... bury it completely to the bottom of your substrate and you get a decent root tab fertilizer for about 1:100th the cost.  ++wink++
I have a well planted 20 gallon tank and after spending a good deal of money on special order plants from all over the internet (let's be honest, local pet shops don't carry as full a variety and selection as the internet does), I decided that I would give these tabs a try. I have been a religious user of Flourish Excel but thought these tabs would be a nice addition as they are solid and not fluid. I do not know why, but I feel as though the tabs are more of a surefire way to deliver the nutrients directly to the roots of my plants instead of relying on the Excel fluid alone. I inserted the first set of tabs a few days ago and time will tell if it will be worth it for me to keep them in my weekly plant feeding regimen.
These fertilizer tabs are the ones that I found recommended the most on tropical fish/plants message boards.  So they were one of the first things I bought when I planted my tank.  I've found my plants stay nice and green (after adjusting to my tank) and don't seem to lack for any nutrients, and this is the only fertilizer I use.  I'm more than satisfied with them.  You only have to replace them once every 4 months, so its not as expensive as a lot of other fertilizers, and they apparently do the job!.
Whether you use plant substrate or not, these root tabs are a must for root feeding plants! You'll see noticeable response from the plants within 24hrs. [assuming all other conditions, like lighting, are favorable]. Heavy root feeders which are vigorously growing should get a new tab at 2mos. Don't add these right at the base of the plant. NEVER vacuum the gravel when using root tabs -- there is no point in wasting your money if you're going to vacuum the gravel... If the tabs are released into the water column, an algae storm will break loose. Planted aquariums should never have the gravel vacuumed anyway as it disturbs the roots of plants and also removes all the good stuff plants feed on.  Just hover the vacuum about 4 or 5 inches above the gravel to remove detritus if you have to.PROS:High Quality, Good Value, Easy to UseCONS:algae problems when used incorrectly
The product arrived quite fast, and was packages well. I opened it and I used it for my 20g tropical aquarium, I read many good things about seachem so I gave it a go :) I have sand substrate and put two in there, just because I only had 2 plants that I thought need root tabs, the rest should be fine with the liquid seachem fert :) I had to be picky of what I buy because I have African dwarf frogs, so they don't react well to fertilizer. They seem fine and happy! Hopefully my plants will flourish :D
When my aquarium had a breakout of skin flukes I bought this thinking it would cure my ailing fish. Although it did seem to prevent the parasites from spreading to unaffected fish, it did not kill the parasites or cure the fish that already had visible symptoms. It may work at curing your fish if you catch the symptoms soon enough and add some right away. I like that its safe and natural, none of my fish showed any signs of distress while I administered this product. I was able to get rid of the skin flukes after adding Maracyn-two and CopperSafe to the mix. I haven't given up on ParaGuard yet though! I will probably use it as my first option if any parasite-like symptoms appear again in the future.
This is great!  My regular ammonia test kit is really hard to read - the colors are barely different, so I missed a potential problem.  The colors on this tester are very clear, and it is constantly testing for a deadly toxin in my aquarium.  I thought I'd save my money initially until I lost my favorite cardinal fish to an unexpected ammonia spike.  I hate learning the hard way, but this would have saved the day, and it will next time.  Also, I used Kent Ammonia Detox Professional and it worked GREAT to save the rest of my fish.  I highly recommend both of these to anyone who has a saltwater tank.
Maybe I'm stupid, but it took me awhile to figure out how to read it -- the instructions weren't that clear to me. It finally dawned on me after a few hours.The indicator is basically a 'doughnut', divided into 4 equal segments. The center of the doughnut is the 'reading' section. You compare the color of the center with the outer 4 segments. Duh! Okay, I'm good now.It's unobtrusive, but easy to see. I haven't noticed a change in color yet, which is a good thing. Keep in mind, that it won't read accurately under a certain pH level.Recommended4 Stars.
I've used Seachem  ammonia Alert meters for years and find them indispensable.The meters do NOT replace proper testing of your water parameters and are not meant to. They simply alert you to Ammonia spikes.They will not give you a specific reading but rather inform you at a glance if there's a problem ranging from alert to toxic.From that point you need to get out your test kits and confirm your ammonia level.The meters perform exactly as intended - and most serious hobbyists have been relying on them for decades as a tool to prevent potential disaster.Each meter will last about a year, but I replace mine every six months or so - to stay on the safe side.At the minimal price for these meters I find them an exceptional value when used correctly for their intended purpose.Seachem ammonia alert meters provide a great deal of peace of mind - not to mention warning you of potential disaster and loss of fish through ammonia poisoning.
Put it in my 75 gal tank during the  cycling  phase;the free ammonia on the button portion of the Seachem sensor  read the same amount  as the Seachem ammonia test kit did( Master API liquid test kit read a tad higher-ammonia and ammonium both register on that kit). It took several hours for the sensor to register the ammonia level-but what the heck, I had to wait 30 minutes for the Seachem ammonia kit to register an ammonia reading!Overall, I am pleased to have an easy to read alert card inside the aquarium. I will continue daily liquid tests ...... it has not earned my complete trust just yet! But so far so good..... I will update this post if things go S O U T H !
Over the last 15 years I have tried every brand of carbon out there. From Marinlan to the generic brands even some of the store brands that you buy from Petco or Petsmart.Does this work? Oh yeah quite well in fact. BUT so does the cheap stuff. I have bought 3lb bags of generic carbon from a seller here on Amazon and that stuff works just as well.The difference? On this product they break it all into tiny little bits compared to the cheap stuff is usually in pellet form.personally I have considered even grinding or blending (in a blender) the cheap stuff to see if you can achieve the same consistency as the more prepared stuff from this company or Marineland. Not that I can or can not prove ot really makes any difference.Personally I am going back to the cheap stuff. I clean my filter every two months and replace the carbon then and like I said can't see any difference. At least not one worth paying 5x as much for .
I switched from pre-bagged Fluval carbon in my canisters and Aquaclears to this carbon in a reusable Fluval bag, and it's proven to work well in tank keeping the water crystal clear, lasts just as long if not longer than I'm used to, and isn't too bad to wash; there is a fair amount of dust, but it washes off quite quickly in regular faucet flow.The only thing I'd recommend is buying a bigger canister than you think you need--it's more economical in larger canisters, and you go through it fairly quickly if you have more than one tank at home, like I do. I bought the 1L size and ran low fairly quickly filling 1 canister filter and a few Aquaclears. A 2L size would likely last me a more appropriate time, perhaps 6 months. (this based upon changing carbon 1x a month).
Ok, so how bizarre is it that I live in South Fla. and I'm paying top dollar for MOSQUITO LARVAE? Anyway, I have a large Black Ghost that is very shy and loves bloodworms, but will only eat late at night when all the lights are out.I ended up trying this product because all the local pet stores were out of the frozen bloodworms I usually feed him and I had to come up with something. I'll tell you what, these are much more convenient than frozen worms and the Ghost and all the other fish love them too. I predict I will be buying many more cans of this stuff.
I was so impressed with the quick shipment and reasonable cost of most products through Marketplace and this vendor. I am so pleased I will dump the big name fish and aquarium dealer out of Pennsylvania. I will order from the Marketplace from now on. The big Pennsylvania dealer has let me down 5 times in the last 6 months without any apology or feedback. I'm still waiting for my blood worms from them since the first week in May. Still no update on that order either. I'm so done with them. Their loss, not mine. Thanks for the good service test! I will be back!
Iv been using this food for my fish for a while and I'm just starting to realize its killing my fish.I gave this to my fish once a week, every time I used this food at least one of my fish would die.I stopped using this food for a few months and not one fish died, used it again and two fish died.The worms expand in the fishes stomach and kills them.The directions on the back of food says soak the worms, which I never did since I never knew fish food had directions.Well even after soaking the worms in water for 5 minutes the fish still died.
After a bout of supreme disapproval from my cats, Sentry has returned to the original formula and my cats are back to eating it right from the tube.  The tube that I purchased through Amazon came with a sticker on it showing the ingredients clearly.  The original formula that the cats loved had/has mineral oil as the primary ingredient.  The formula that they had changed to which the cats wouldn't touch had corn syrup listed as the first ingredient.  Sentry's customer service personnel told me that was how I could tell when the formula was reverted back.  So, watch the ingredient list, but I can testify that the product coming now from Amazon is the original formula. :) Big smiles coming from me and my cats.
I bought the Sentry HC Petromalt Malt Flavored Cat Hairball Treatment from Amazon because the price is good and because my cat thinks she can't live without it. The packaging looks the same as it always has, but, when I squeezed a bit of the Hairball Treatment out of the tube the same way I always have, the cat recoiled and would not lick it off the top of the tube. However, she still goes to the tube and begs for it. I didn't know what to do. I considered returning the product. Finally, two days ago, I had an idea. When my cat, Beauty, came begging for her twice weekly dab, I dabbed a bit of the Sentry HC Petromalt Malt Flavored Cat Hairball Treatment on my kitchen counter. She licked it up without hesitation!! The only explanation I can think of is that she's afraid of the way it plops out of the tube. Anyway, we're both happy now!(Yes, my cats are allowed to jump up on the counter.)
Treats up to 2000 gallons! Bootle is almost 10 inches high and 5 inches wide. I used it with my fishes inside and their fine. The bottle cap shows how much to add in water " So Easy" Half cap for every 10 gallons and Full cap for every 20 gallons. I water is really clear. IT can take 12 hours to be perfectly clear from foggyness. IT gives the fish its slim coat for pertection of skin and gills and prevents cuts that can kill them. I have 16 platies that are rare colors and since I added this liquid they are better in skin color,swim faster, and mate faster! "Babies"
I have been trying to change the water more frequently (like I'm suppose too) and it is helping my tank but I was using a lot of chemical .. I ordered this because it was such a better price than my local pet store.  And WOW they carefully pakaged it to make sure all my items were safe just in case it did leak (Which it didn't) this will last me a while and was cheaper than my local store (Even saved me a trip to the Store) High 5 for me!
I've been using this product for some time, although this is the first time I've thought to purchase it from Amazon.  I use some of this in the water each time we do a partial water change, which is typically monthly.  This product not only offsets the chlorine in tap water, but also adds protective products into the water to minimize the stress to the fish.I have to say, I've been paying as much for the 8 ounce version of this product at my local pet store.  Thank you, Amazon... 4 times as much product for the same price... and with Subscribe and Save, I can set it up for automatic delivery!
This product has worked well in both of my tanks. It assists in the cycling process versus cycling. The proof is in the pudding, bye a test kit and pre-and post test (after approximately a week). Do yourself a favor and follow the instructions to a "T".In most cases, people who fail, didn't do something right, or expected it to do what it wasn't advertised to do. Don't dump fish in tank in heavy loads just because the test reads ready, give it another week of consistent test first. Yes you can add fish right away, but not too many at once. Remember to let tank run for at least 24-48 hours before adding anything, including this product. This will allow the water to settle and temperature regulate.  Be patient.
I bought this for my Betta Fish and found it does not keep the water clear longer. I suggest using distilled or purified water when cleaning a Betta Fish tank. Once you've transferred your Betta to clean water (do not use tap water), rinse and clean tank, gravel and fake plants with HOT water. Refill 1/3 of tank with distilled or purified water, Pour  fish back in tank and fill tank to 3/4 of distilled or purified water. If you have a Betta, you don't need this. Do you best not to over feed them.
You can&#8217;t just add tap water to the fish tank &#8211; you have to dechlorinate it. This product does just that. It works instantly, so it is very convenient. It comes in a nice little bottle with a built-in dropper. This lets you easily measure out how much you need. You don&#8217;t need a lot. I do wish that they had instructions for the amount of drops you need per gallon. It just says to use 1 tsp per 10 gallons, which isn&#8217;t appropriate if you are just doing a water change or if you have a smaller tank.
This stuff really works. I have a one gallon tank with a baby betta and i bought this for i do not have a filter. It has measurements for a 10+ gallon tank so you have to estimate how much to put in for a smaller tank. The cap is the measuring cup. This stuff does not smell good but it works. It is a gasoline colored liquid and disappears into the water after a few seconds. Does not affect fish if it is in tank while put in. Id recommend putting it in the tank after a water change or when new water is put in. It makes tap water healthy for fish to swim in.
I own and operate three aquaclear 70s on my aquariums. These filters offer the best in terms of value, quality, and function.The impeller can, however, wear down with use. In my case, four years of solid operation before I started hearing progressively worse rattling from the unit. Removing the impeller i saw striations and scratches in the magnetic portion. This is due to pieces of gravel or more specifically abrasive sand wearing it down.  Often after a water change a lot of sediment can get sucked into the filter and housing. This sand causes the motor to make the magnet vibrate off its axis creating noise.I purchased this replacement and dropped it in after a quick clean of the chamber. Started it up and it was silent! Problem solved.Another option to solve a loud filter is to use Vaseline on the impeller and housing. Be sure it is fish safe first, but the lubrication can and does help. Otherwise I would advise just buying this replacement part.
I don't know what you could really say bad about it, My AquaClear 50 came with a broken impeller so I bought this to replace it. A cool thing I learned was that you can interchange these impellers so you could put an AquaClear 20 impeller inside a AquaClear 70 filter so you have a flower flow. Why would you do this? More Bio Media, More Filter Media and so on!If you are new to tanks you will soon realize you can never have too much filter, if you buy say a AquaClear 20 you will soon find yourself buying a second one so save yourself some time and money and buy the biggest filter you can fit then change the impeller to suit your needs.
Our betta seems to really like these worms, although he has never refused food. We give him micro pellets and once a week we feed him a quarter of a pea to clean out his system. Added these blood worms to vary his diet a little bit. I'm afraid to touch the worms. The first day I had them, I think I inhaled some dust from the container and my throat was itchy and swollen for a while. Make sure to use tweezers or some other instrument to pick up the worms.
I bought this mainly to add variety to my Betta fish's diet.  The fish love to eat this and it does not seem to cloud or otherwise pollute his water.  The worms are a bit small and hard to feed to your fish.  Also some people have reported allergic reactions (there is a warning on the product about this as well) so keep it away from small children.  The container has a child safety lid which can be a bit frustrating for some. Other than that this is a great product that your Betta will love.
While my fish loved these, they don't sink. He could sense it because he was swimming around alert and on the hunt, but they just circulated around the opening (Fluval Edge, 6 Gallon). My platy doesn't really go to the opening much as he just waits for the flake food to be pushed down by the filter flow and then he swims and gobbles up the food, but that wasn't the case with these worms.They were supposed to be his Sunday treat/dinner and since it appeared he wasn't going to get them I dropped in a light pinch of flake food and that's when he finally found the blood worms at the opening.3 star rating because they don't sink. I plan on getting bottom feeders and shrimp and this was going to be a &#34;community treat&#34; in conjunction with their normal feedings but that isn't going to work.
I thought this would be a nice treat for my fish.Unfortunately, my fish are 2 medium sized Oscars.Don't get me wrong, they loved this product. However they are so large that it was a huge hassle for them to eat and they made short work of this container. And this issue is no fault of the company.The only complaint I had was that when it got to me about half the container was crushed tiny bits almost borderline dust. These pieces were way too small for really any fish to eat so once the full-sized ones were gone I had to throw the rest away.
My guppies like them.  I think they are gross!  They are a little big for the guppies, but they are determined.  We also feed these to my daughter's little aquatic frog, and he is doing well.  We never see him eat them, but we put them in at night since he is nocturnal, and turn off the lights.They arrived sealed and fresh.  The top has two parts - an outer blue part and an inner clear part.  They were separated and it was nearly impossible to open the top with the blue part on.  It was horribly aggravating.  I finally ditched the blue part and just kept the clear.  Hopefully sunlight does not affect the freshness of the product.
This tubing was much more narrow than any other aquarium tubing that I currently have. It wouldn't work with any of the three air pumps that I have no matter how much I stretched it. Other than that it seems fine - flexible, seems tough and not brittle. But when a product says &#34;standard&#34; and then doesn't work with any of my pumps I think that's a bit deceptive. Looking at the other reviews as well I think whoever is packaging this is just selling whatever tubing they happen to have spools of at the moment.
It's a long plastic tube to relocate air from one place to another at an extremely low psi. It does that well. It's kind of difficult for it to fail doing that. However, I guess it could have holes or something - but the plastic seems to be good quality without holes or cracks. Hopefully it'll last for many years. Although, the one pictures isn't the same one that showed up. The one I received is the blue colored hose - which makes me no difference, but if you're someone that needs/prefers the clear one shown, you may or may not get that.
Soft, tough but pliable hose that is what I expected, and the price was fair.I got a big roll of it that should be 25 feet but I didnt measure. Its not on a spool, its cut from bulk.The inner diameter is sufficient to flow air for my appliication.It smells VERY strongly of plastic. I couldnt believe how pungent the smell of this tubing was... I was a little worried if some gasses coming off would affect my pets. FWIW they didnt seem to suffer any ill effects.If I buy tubing again it wont be this brand because of the smell.
After reading the good reviews of the Booda perch I placed an order for one........what I received was an Aspenpet brand perch.  I wanted the Booda brand as all the reviews for other cloth perches were not that great......I looked all over the cardboard information that is around the perch and no where on it is the brand name Booda.......I will use it & try it but it is NOT WHAT I ORDERED!!!!!! The only thing the description said was COLOR may vary NOT brand!!! Did arrive on time and packaging was perfect.
I've read some bad things about cloth perches (dangerous because of potential tangles with feet, dirty, etc.) but I know that my birds prefer these to any other kind of perch and I've never had a problem with them.  I keep 1 of these perches in each of my cages as the upper most perch, so that they don't get pooped on when birds are up higher.  I've noticed that my birds like using this as their sleeping perch.  It must feel better on their feet than cement nail filing perches.
These were too long for our cage and so I bent them in a zig-zag shape but they were the closest we could get to 30&#34; length for our cages.  We got 2 other lengths from a previous owner of our cockatiels and noticed that the plastic knobs that screw on to secure the perch to the cage was getting stripped so I hope this doesn't happen with these comfy perches but the birds seem to like them and like following the &#34;yellow brick road&#34; - zig-zagging along - lol!I just wish they would come up with ones that is easy to clean the birds dropping off of.
We have a Conure and he loves to chew stuff.  The first day I put a new Comfy perch in his cage, he christened it by chewing some of it up.  I was a bit disappointed BUT, he stopped and it is still surviving in the cage.  I like these a lot better than wood perches so I keep one in both of his cages and he uses them to perch/sleep on.  ;)  He spends play time on the other perches of different sizes and materials (ie: wood, plastic, manzanita branches, etc).  Helps exercise the feet to have variety.
These perches are great!  They make a lot of room and are very comfortable for my birds.  You can position these perches in any direction, any place.  They don't have to be straight.  This  gives them more room and in different directions.  It's great!!!! I have several different size cages.  These perches come in different sizes and can be used in any size cage.  You can pick any space you feel would be great for your bird(s) to feel comfortable and twist the perch. All the cages have these perches!
While I can't yet review how much my bird likes or dislikes the product (she's still weaning) I can at least review the product itself.The rope is tightly wound giving it a lot of support. The two connectors were very nicely designed and fit my 3/4" bar-spaced cage perfectly. The 28" Large perch was just long enough to make a nice loop in my cage and is thick enough for an African Grey to sit on comfortably. The packaging seems to imply Macaws, but I personally find it too small for their feet and may even buckle a bit under their weight.Either way, it is well constructed and well designed in the regard to attaching to a cage. I think this can add some fun and exciting new perch designs in a cage allowing our birdies to climb and enjoy the different texture (assuming they don't decide its a chew toy).
I've seen the comfy perch in the local pet stores, but was hesitant in buying until I had read the reviews on Amazon.  Therefore I decided to order the item to be delivered, and not worry about the crowded local stores.  I just received the comfy perch, and my 3 year old cockatiel gave me a like tweet.  She always looks like she's smiling, (lol).  I attached it inside her cage, and she step onto the perch, and seem to love the feel.  I'm completely satisfied, and love that it's makes her happy.  The product was also delivered super fast.
I have young parakeets and bought the large perch for them.  At first I thought it might be too big, but far from it.  They adore this thing and crawl up and down it constantly.  It is bendable, so I have it snaking down to the floor of a very large cage, and they traipse up and down this like a ladder all day long.  Also, they love to fly off of it and land.  Apparently the extra large footing gives them the security they need to make a safe landing, and they go all day long doing this.  If I had more room I would buy a second perch, as the birds really love it.
Got this because of the near perfect reviews.  I was disappointed.  The only good thing I can say about this product is that it is very quiet.  I wanted to cut down on clutter and reduce the amount of air pumps on my 5 tanks.  Figured I could run numerous air stones and bubble wands off of this.  It can run one bubble wand or air stone fantastically.  It will run 2 ok with a noted reduction in bubbles.  Add any more than that and the bubbles are reduced to a mere trickle.  I set this up 2 different ways to see it was my set up or the item.  First try was with gang valves.  Second try was with all hoses connected with connector tee's.  Same problem with both set ups.  So, sadly, this item is being used on a single bubble wand.  I am now using another brand of pump instead of this to run 8 air stones in 4 separate tanks with no problem at all.
Simply the best and quietest pumps I have ever used. It pushes a lot of air and works like a champ. Reliability is second to none with a great warranty to boot. Like all pumps the diaphrams will eventually wear out (though not for YEARS). These air pumps are made with some heavy duty diaphrams and replacment parts are everywhere on the internet. Replacment is simple enough. Buy it your fish and your ears will be happy you did. Smashes Renas, regular whispers, (especially)JW's, and all other pumps in it's class.
This did a great job of cleaning my cats. It isn't too thick, easily works into the fur, gets rid of bad smell, etc. The only issue is I am not smelling any scent from it, their fur just smells like cat. That could be a good thing, especially since it shows how well it is working at getting rid of odor rather than simply masking it, but personally I like my cats to have a fresh scent after a bath. I will continue using this though since it does work so well.
I  washed my kitten off last night with this shampoo. He is a ragdoll cat which are known for their soft, bunny like fur, but when I washed him with this shampoo his fur is SO soft and luscious. It also shines. I even used this on my angora hamster (not sure if this is recommended), but she was also soft and shiny. It leaves a nice pleasant scent and while it is gentle it also cleaned stains and poo out of my kitten's fur. (The reason for the bath. I am SO glad I got the shampoo before I got the kitten.
It arrived in different packaging, but as far as I can tell, the product is the same. It came to me in a non-transparent red bottle. It gets the job done and it doesn't irritate my kittens' skin. It's a bummer that this is an add-on item, but I ordered two bottles and so that should be enough to last me for a long while. Doesn't have any noticeable odors, either.4 stars because when the bottles arrived, they had both leaked all over the place. Luckily the other things in my package were wrapped in plastic.
Smells great and makes for extra fluffy and soft kitties! I usually pour a little into a spray bottle and then dilute it with some water so that it's sprayable. I wash my cat about once every few months to keep my allergies at bay and because she gets kinda dusty from being medium-haired. She's indoors-only, though, so there's not much of an issue of her getting smelly or actually dirty unless she gets poopybutt. It's nice that it's tearless so I don't have to worry that it'll sting if it accidentally gets in her eyes- her eyes and nose are always a little runny from herpes, and I'm able to wash her face with a little bit of shampoo to work the crusties out without her complaining too much.
I ordered this sponge as an addendum sponge for myAquaClear 110 Aquarium Power Filter. I don't use carbon or zeolite in my filter so the added sponge is good for some extra bacterial growth and as another layer of mechanical filtration.I was slightly disappointed that the newer AquaClear sponge was obviously made from a different material than my older AquaClear sponge. The newer material is more porous and not nearly as effective at catching particulates. I also think there is less area for bacterial growth as the newer sponge is significantly less dense than my older sponge. I wasn't entirely pleased with the overall quality and hope this is just an issue for one batch of these sponges and not the trend for AquaClear sponges in the future.The sponges do their job, but with a denser sponge they could do their job better. I usually trust Hagen products, but I am concerned with this sponge's decrease in quality and hope this isn't indicative of Hagen products in general.
While pet-sitting a red-eared slider, my husband and I found that the small turtle we are watching loves these sticks. Though we have to break the sticks into smaller pieces, because it's a baby turtle we're watching, the sticks do float for a few hours (if they aren't eaten right away) and they are easily broken to a perfect size for her little mouth. She prefers these sticks over all the other things we feed her, so they must be pretty tasty, but I would always suggest feeding real foods as well as this product, even though this is a great product, since an important key to a healthy pet is the right kind of diversity in their diet. I highly recommend this product to owners or keepers of aquatic turtles, especially red-eared sliders, since I'm especially aware of their taste for it.
My red eared slider has been eating these sticks for four years and he still loves them!  These sticks float on the surface of the water for a long time giving Turtle good opportunity to eat them before they sink.  Many online turtle forums claim this is the best turtle food.  I can't disagree.  I live in a dry climate so I bought the more economical large size which lasts for more than a year.  The only food Turtle likes better is live fish, which he gets every two-three weeks to give him exercise.
This product works fine, but please keep your expectations reasonable.Peat is used to soften the water and lower ph.  It does so by reducing carbonate hardness.  This is the water's buffering capacity.  Once the carbonate hardness has been lowered, the ph will start to drop.  The buffering capacity is the water's resistance to ph drops.  To drop the ph, you first have to lower the resistance.Peat may not work for you if your tap water is very hard.  A high GH usually accompanies a high KH (carbonate hardness).  If the water is too hard, peat alone may not be enough to lower your ph.  In my situation, the GH out of the tap is approximately 400-450ppm!  With water this hard, peat alone will not do the job.  You would first need to remove most of the hardness.  Which you can do, using several different methods.  Reverse Osmosis, Ion Exchange, or using rain water.
My water is a bit hard. Maybe too hard... dGH is around 12 and dKH is at 5-6, pH: 7.8I put a bag (about one cup) of these granules in a marineland 100 biowheel filter and I have not seen any changes in pH. This stuff only yellows my water and browns my plants. Its not as bad as it sounds. the yellow water is not harmful to the fish and the brown stuff on the leaves is just small accumulated particles of peat. Maybe I need more peat? Or what am I doing wrong?I also run the marineland filter with a Fluval C2 which only has two small bags of API's ammo-carb.
This product has worked wonders for me with small, external fungal growths and bacterial infections that developed on many of my fish during a columnaris outbreak.  I prefer to use it as a 10 - 30 second dip at a high concentration, or as a 30min - 1 hour bath at double concentration.  I've even dropped it directly on the fish's infection and the fuzz was gone right away with no adverse affects.  It's nice because you can mix it with Kanamycin, Nitrofurazone and/or Metronidazole for an even more effective bath when treating severe bacterial infections.
This product is an excellent treatment to prevent fungal infections in fish.  That said, it also does a nice job of killing plants and, due to the copper in the product, killing invertibrates (snails, shrimp, worms...).  I've also read that this stuff has medicinal value if you have a fungal infection in the brain.  (Yes, apparently this can happen.)  However, I wouldn't endorse or recommend the purchase of this product for that purpose, or attempting self-treatment without doctor supervision.
I was happy to order this product. It got here quick. Saddly after 5 minutes the pump blew. I called pondmaster who refused to honor the warrenty due to the amount of rebuilt equipment comming from sellers on Amazon and Ebay. The seller has said they will return the money and refused to exchange for another product. I paid $10 for return shipping (wich will not be refunded to me) and still no word from the seller. I have had to call Amazon to make sure I get my money back. All I can say is BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!
I purchased this thru Amazon about 3-4 months ago....and it suddenly quit.Worked great until then. Not sure who to contact......UPDATE:Contacting the company and found out that Amazon is not a "designated distributor" for their product so they won't take it back!!I tried to take apart the pump as per their suggestion and found out the pump impeller was Broken!....and the whole thing is now good as a door stop.I don't have the money to waste.And this was definitely a BIG WASTE.
So far this pump/filter setup has worked for me. My pond is 8x10 and 2 1/2 feet at its deepest and 1 foot at the lowest. The pump has been running none stop for 2 weeks now and I have not experienced any issues. The filter that came with it is good, it does the job of filtering and it is also easy to clean.Edit:I have now changed my review to 2 stars. After just a little over 2 months of off and on use the pump has stopped working. I thought it might have been clogged but when I took it out of my pond it was clean and no excessive debris was in the filter. If you are look for a pump to run continuously then stay away from this one.
A lot of the reviews said this stone won't put out as much air as the pictures show, so far, so good for me. A couple notes, though - if you use the pass through connection (you can hook up incoming air to one side, and another tube to another air stone on the other side) you won't get nearly as many air bubbles. So keep that in mind, it seems to pass through a lot of the air through the other tube, sacrificing it's own usefulness. If this is the only stone you'll have, though, perfect!
I put this 5 1/2" wand in my tank a little over a month ago. Now only half of the bar produces bubbles. It was great while it lasted but if I have to replace it every time I clean my 55 gal tank, it will be too expensive. I will have to look for other brands. Most of the Penn Plax Air stone I have bought lately just don't last long. They are made in China so what I bought maybe counterfeit or they just aren't making good quality anymore. It seems that the pet stores around me only carry this brand and I think one other. Not much to choose from.
This works well, although I will say my pump didn't!  This stone put out maybe 2 streams of bubbles!  So I bought a better pump and tried this product again.  MUCH better.  I got a pump rated for a 55G tank instead of my 10G pump.  I will say that I get an even stream of bubbles now although I wouldn't say they are super fine bubbles.  They aren't as many/small as the picture, but it still looks nice.I will say I tried to connect this to another stone and it didn't work.  Again, I think I should have gone up to a 100G pump to connect two and have them work, but in reality, they didn't connect together well so I'm not sure if it would have really worked in the end anyway.
Will only pump air about 3 inches under water, then the pressure becomes too much.Batteries are loose so if you shake it it will turn on and off.very short power (3 feet max if not 2 feet) cord makes it obnoxious to set up on a fish tank. Has a clip on the back that will not fit on anything you'd have on our around your aquarium, so difficult to mount or put anywhere.It does what it is supposed to do though, which is turn on when the power goes out. I have mine so the tube is 1 inch under water so itll break surface tension in the case of power outage. Very cheaply does what it says it will.
This is perfect for a backup system for your aquarium. Plug it into an outlet, put batteries in and then it will turn on automatically when the power is out to that outlet. I plugged mine into the same power-strip my filter runs off of, so if the filter stops, the bubbles will start and save the fish.Runs a bit loud, but that's to be expected from an emergency backup system. I actually like that it makes noise, so you can be alerted that it's running right away so you know something wrong with the power to the tank.Takes 2 D batteries, but can run on a single battery. I didn't notice a change in output with one vs. two batteries, so I'm guessing one battery just runs out quicker than with two.As an included bonus, you can use this air pump to aid in transporting fish long distances.
I have bought three different bubble wands. One smaller, it whistles, rather unimpressive in a 20 gallon long tank. I also bought the bendable, strong bubbles, not bad. But this one by far is the best, only problem it whistles as well. I have had no trouble putting it together and it creates a beautiful, thick, steady wall of bubbles. Just bought another one to replace the whistled. Bought four altogether and within two weeks all whistled. My Bettas loved them, but sanity wins in the end. I removed them.
I ordered these to use in a deep water culture hydroponic application.  They produce a good flow of bubbles, but will vary depending on size of air pump.  Heavy enough to stay put and wont float in my buckets.  UPDATED.  After a summer of growing awesome cherry toms these stones held up to roots and nutrients.  Amazing roots like spaghetti noodles, I definitely attribute this to good air flow in the buckets.  I put one in my Aquarium after and I like the bubbles and so do the fish.
I am using several of these for my Aquaponics garden 300 Gallon fish tank. I just have them laying over the side of the tank on the bottom about 4 feet deep. The amount of air seems to be just what I needed for my size tank any the 45 Lph air pump. Only drawback is they do in fact float on the one side. This isn't really a problem for a tank like mine but I can see it being a problem for a home aquarium unless you weigh it down. I noticed there is a spot on the back about the size of a dime that you could actually put in a couple of fishing weights in and then seal it with silicone over the top. That should keep it down and I might do that if it later causes a problem.
I always get the smallest and finest bubbles from the disks.  I've bought this a few times now, for different parts of my tank.  The downside is that they are less versatile than the long block air stones.  I find putting these in corners is nice, but also if you put this in the middle of the tank, put driftwood over it.  The bubbles will roll on the underside of the driftwood and float up in less of a circle.  Gives you more options in terms of tank placement.
I put it in my fish tank and it has great bubbles (so far). My problem is, that it will not stay on the floor of the tank. I have tried weighing it down using extra connection tubing and gravel, but it still wants to float. I also tried reducing the air flow to almost nothing, but that did not work either.  I ended up wedging it behind a large intake tube to keep it from floating to the top of the tank. I like the bubbles but, I don't like the fact that it will not stay on the bottom gravel bed.
What a great little bubbler!  I have to say, if you don't follow the instructions and soak it for an hour or more before hooking it up, you deserve for it not to work properly.  I did so, and it is blowing out so much air that I had to tone it down a bit with the gang valve.  Have two of these hooked up to a "60-100" air pump in a 150 gallon tank, and it is an amazing show for sure!  The fish love it and the tank has cleared up more that it was before hand.Great purchase, take your time and follow the instructions, and you should have a fine air bubbler in your tank.Yes it floats just a bit, be prepared to cover it with your substrate.  I completely covered my two and they still bubble like they were sitting on the top of the substrate.
You're probably looking at this product because you are looking for a good, cheap air stone.  Well, these are definitely cheap.  I had my reservations when I saw how much green &#34;sand&#34; was loose in the packaging blister.  They continued to crumble and flake as I put the tubing on.  I had to pull the tubing off of one to make a length adjustment, and the plastic nipple popped right out of the stone and is not repairable.The ones that did not break do work, but the bubbles are much larger than other stones.  They &#34;hog&#34; the air from my denser air stones.  If you are going to plug in multiple items into your airline, these will use a disproportionate amount of your air.The price was very cheap, but the quality is equally so.  I definitely suggest looking elsewhere.
So I got this for a simple little glass bowl, and it seems to work just fine! The bottom white portion of the filter turned yellowish after a few days, other then that it seems to work just fine. Im not sure if I should worry about the yellowing on the filter but the one fish in the bowl seems to be just fine. I think that the bubbles are a little noisy but that can be adjusted by lowering the air flow. I will update this post after a while and if anything big changes within the next couple of weeks! Thanks
I have used these filters in Betta bowls and small tanks for many years, and they are just perfect  for the Bettas.  I don'tnecessarily run it all the time since Betta fish like calm water, so a few hours per day does the job!  You just pull out thedirty filter and pop in the clean one  (rinse under water first).  They can last  2 or 3 weeks.  When you clean the bowl ortank you can take the filter holder out and clean it up, so you don't have to buy the whole assembly each time, just thecartridges.
Should had read the other reviews before ordering.Upon opening my package I found a filter cartridge set that did not even remotely resemble what I ordered or the ones in the picture. Instead I received "Carbon/floss filter cartridges" which are tube like and small. How does someone mix that up? I could have just picked up the filters at the store but now I need to repackage the item, go to the post office, and then to the store anyway (not going to order these here again). Bad service.
So I bought this thinking it would be great and it is, kinda. I hooked it up and it sounded like someone was making soup. It bubbles and it's pretty loud. My male betta didn't like the water movement so I just took the carbon and stuff out of it and put it in one of my Tetra filters. The noise made me do it.  Ps. If you do but this, rinse the cartridge very well with cold water! other wise it will cloud the tank because of the carbon.
I bought a 30 so I can have a slightly underpowered powerhead to get some flow in my tank and it turned out to be perfect for my 40gal.  As for it being loud, I'd have to say no unless your tank is not producing a small waterfall by your filter, I'd say it probably would create some slight noise but if your looking for absolute zero noise pollution, don't put anything in your tank really.It comes with a hang on back clamp and also a suction cup which is a nice option. It creates tons of bubbles or none at all depending on your adjustment made by an external knob that sits outside of your tank for ease of accessibility.If you have smaller fish, they may get sucked up into the inlet, if that's the case then I suggest the attachment filter.
I really like the AquaClear Powerhead. I use the filter attachment to keep the water crystal clear. Small particles are picked up by the filter inside the tube attachment and after 3 weeks the filter needs changed because it picks up stuff the regular filters miss. The Powerhead also puts out bubbles. I think bubbles add oxygen to the water, and helps to keep the fish healthier. I have a 55 gallon aquarium, and I use two AquaClear filters that hang on the side, plus the AquaClear Powerhead with the attachment. I live in the country so I use well water, which is high in minerals. I put polyfilters inside the AquaClear filters that hang on the side. This  combination of filters keep the tank clean for 2 months before it's time to clean.
This powerhead works extremely well and is extremely quiet. It's made in Italy and the workmanship and material is excellent. The flow is reversible, can be adjusted and has a Venturi valve so you can aerate the water as well. It comes with two attachments so you can attach it to the side or attach it from the top edge.I got it for my 55 gallon tank but the flow was so powerful that I had to dial it down. I'm going to split the flow and put diffusers on them so that the flow will not be that strong.As far as noise goes, it is absolutely noiseless without the Venturi. But if you connect it, it will make noise as the air bubbles will create noise. As I already have air bubblers, I didn't use this function.Overall, very satisfied with quality and price.
I use this for my 10 gallon saltwater tank.  Creates enough flow for the whole tank.  To those that dislike the bubbles that this produces, you can reduce the amount of air intake using the air adjuster valve.  You may get a couple bubbles at the lowest setting, but virtually none.  You can also adjust the power of the powerhead.  I am not 100% sure how this would fair in a 20 gallon tank and bigger, but as stated before, it's perfect for my 10 gallon saltwater tank.  It's quiet, does its job.  5 Stars!
I made the mistake of going for large capacity. These work to good and seem to suck some the gravel past the grates and eventually get clogged. Also the red adjustment to reverse the flow requires dismantling the pump and remove the red insert to get the arm to move back to full suction.Other than these negative this pump is great. I would buy them again but in a smaller size.Vent tubes absorbed water, turned white and shrunk within 6 months in fresh water. Mount design is excellent and strong and input funnel has good range of adjustment.
This is in a 20 long pulling through a hydro 2 sponge filter.With this setup, it has the perfect flow for my aquarium. I'm gonna have to go ahead and be the stereotypical amazon reviewer here though and have one minor complaint , even though this product works perfectly for me. Its just that I thought that this being an adjustable powerhead, it would have a browser range of adjustability. I guess I thought the range would be more like slow flow all the way to a blast. Its a much narrower range. This is also the first adjustable powerhead I've ever bought ,so what the hell do I know anyway.
to really get crap out of tubing the brush could stand to b a bit less soft. It does flex well to get thru tubing but If your trying to get coralline off it's not very effective unless you soak whatever in a strong vinegar bath for a good while first. Takes a bit of scrubbing for algae too! I also had the brush come off also inside my protein skimmer...luckily I could get some tweezers in the hole & pull it out! I got it screwed back in tight but now don't trust it as much!To those that had trouble w/the brush coming off, if u just twist it back into the wire tubing it goes right back! Just tighten it REALLY hard & it'll stay! I've done that after it came off & it's been fine! Still needs to b a bit less wimpy of a brush though!!
It sounds like you're getting a lot but in fact it's a little more than 2 square feet.  Just wanted to point that out.  It's exactly what I get in the store, works great in my filters.  It catches tons of stuff, as evidenced by the fact that when I clean my filters I can wring brown water out of this filter and spray out gunk with a nozzle.  I tend to use this filter for more than one month, sometimes 2 or 3 depending on how worn it looks, and how well it's still catching stuff.  I also tend to use many products, like multiple layers of bio filter and some mechanical filter, and bags of carbon and other cleansers, so if this product doesn't work as well at 3 months as it does at 1 month, my water still stays clean.
I like to use these in my fish tanks to catch debris and food before it gets a chance to hit my main filters. You can cut them to size and one roll lasts years. I use them in the tank on intake hose, food gets caught and the fish still have a chance to eat it, when its dirty I toss it.I also use this inside my filters if I run out of my regular pre filters and need to replace. I cut to size and use till my good filters arrive in the mail.
LLego his fast. on time and very good.Marineland congratulate for your great years of experience and performance in its class and all materials. I consider that there are some better products. But this filter is the best, has good consistency is big enough and long.I bought it to make the penguin 100 filter replacements. Simply cut and paste box with quick-drying glue (obviously add some activated carbon inside) ... and ready ..and you save a lot ...Easy, practical, simple, very fast. I recommend it.
An inexpensive (when purchased here @ Amazon, at least) replacement cartridge, identical to the one that came with my H.O.T. Magnum aquarium filter, which lasted over ten years.Great for occasional 'water polishing', but not suitable for longterm, continuous aquarium filtration, as its ultra fine particle filtration capacity means that it soon clogs with debris (2-3 days)and greatly reduces the filter's flow. It then requires an overnight soaking in a bleach and water solution, followed by a second soak in a dechlorinator solution, before being used again.Be sure to install this filter cartridge with the blue, 'Right Size' foam filter sleeve over it, to help pre-filter larger particles that would contribute to the micron cartridge becoming clogged even sooner than usual.
This cartridge is a good solid filter for use with the Marineland 330 or 350 canister filter and &#34;polishes&#34; the aquarium water well. I alternate between this filter and the filter media canister which acts like a regular filter. The Marineland Canister filter is great and easy to set up and change out the filters. I bought an extra Micron Cartridge and media canister to make changes faster and to have an extra micron filter so while I'm recharging one I have another to put in the filter. (Yes! The micron filter can be regenerated using a chlorine and water solution and reused).I also use a power filter with bio-wheels. The result a crystal clear 60 gallon tank with a heavy fish load.
Can't say too much about it becuase if your system takes this filter pad sleeve, then you have to buy it. And the pad does what it is suppose to do. I was surprise at how the price has gone up in recent years for this item. That is why I recommend washing the pads and reuse them until they begin to fall apart. The best way is to take it outside and use a strong stream of water from a garden hose. The water from the wash can also help your plants grow better.
So I received the filters in a three pack, I purchased these because it was recommended from the tank kit I recently purchased. Everything seems to be okay, except for one thing. The filters seem to leak the material inside the filters. I didn't think it was a big deal at first until I saw that there is six chambers filled with this black rock like material, only four of the chambers are filled. The two chambers that are not filled are on both ends of the filter. My problem with that is, those ends are were the water first makes contact with the filter as well as when it leaves the filter. So the water is not getting filtered as much as it should be. When it comes to taking care of your animals its important that cleaning is done the right way. I will use these up and look for another brand that will fit my tank. Or purchase them locally so I can inspect them before I buy them.
The blue pad gets clogged up rather quickly in my Penguin 100 Power Filter. The filter itself is wonderful. These little filter cartridges, on the other hand, do what all cartridges do. They clog up within a week or two in an established tank. However, if you rinse them out a bit in tank water when doing a water change, it helps a lot (you can get a month out of them easily this way). And if you are feeling particularly adventurous, some even use Marineland brand activated carbon to refill these bad boys. It takes a little touch and a pocket knife to slice open the top of the cartridge, but you CAN empty the carbon out, refill and reuse until the blue pad becomes too damaged.
Works great. I've been purchasing them through Amazon for around 6 months now. I have found that Amazon is the cheapest place to purchase these filters from (especially compared to local pet stores like Petsmart and Petco). I run my filter with two in at a time, rotating which one I switch every two or three weeks as needed. I have found that doing it this way and not removing both filters at once helps keep stability in the water and puts less stress on the fish as the filters contain good bacteria that keep ammonia down. Have yet to have an issue with them. :)
I switched from Tetra to Penguin a while ago, and really appreciate the all-in-one design of these. While I'm sure there integrated plastic backing isn't all that great for the environment, I certainly do not miss having to rebuild filter media every few weeks. It's just pull-out and drop-in, or sometimes I'll just spray the gunk off of the blue side and use that for a while. I've never had a problem with water &#34;poking through&#34; these filters like I did with the others. The convenience is appreciated.
fit my eclipse hood. When i have goldfish in tank these get dirty real quick but with other fish they last a reasonable time. Easy to place in hood and keep water nice and clear.I use a old one for the frame and cut the filter material off and then fill with some charcoal and place a cut to fit filter pad on it and used that way for goldfish since they are dirty and it got costly to replace so often. I use the regular way now ,as is , for loaches and cory in tank. This is an excellent price on them.i stock up from amazon .com when i can.
I have 4 Penguin Bio-wheels running on 3 tanks, so I figured that I'd save a bit of extra cash by using walmart brand aqua-clear filters on the Penguins; since they look identical. Boy, was that a mistake. They may look the same, but in the Penguin filters they use "black diamond" activated carbon, which is worlds different from aqua-clear. You can really tell by the water quality.I will purchase these all the time now, as it's the best price around!
I have used these filters for quite some time.  Hard to find parts for them.  BUT fortunately the filter cartridges are sized for multiple filters.  I will actually be just dumping the carbon out of them into the trash.  You can cut it with a razor blade and dump out the carbon before it gets wet.  Then you can slide in a purigen pack in it.http://www.amazon.com/Seachem-165-Purigen-100ml/dp/B0002A5VK2/ref=pd_sim_petsupplies_5Then throw some Seachem BIO Matrix in some mesh baggies and throw an air bubbler under the BIO Matrix and you're all set.In my case I do it through the media trays.
I bought my first box of these filters at Petsmart for $20 and here they are, same exact thing from the store, only half the price. I wish i found them sooner. It arrived in perfect condition, as if I bought it at the store! I could have bought 2 boxes here, for the price of the i paid $20 dollars for. Oh well, lesson learned. You will definitely save money by purchasing them on here, just make sure you're not completely out before you order them here. I ordered them when I was about halfway through my box, and they got here right on time. Will buy again... Very soon.
What's to say, a replacement convenient cartridge?Please note that when it first slows the water down I canclean it out with pure water a few times to extend the life.Another neat idea, if you tank gets at all dirty or you reallywant to get your water super clean, get "old school" fiberglass and spread it out and put it as a pre-filter beforethe filter.  It's has much more filtering capacity thanthe cartridge or cotton.  You can find fiber glass in laboratorysupplies.Don't know why they no longer sell it for filtering.
These are available at my local big box store at about twice the price. I have doubled up on my 36 gallon with two power filters, so I use more. I only need to rinse them every week and change them every two months now, so it's nice to have a good supply. Before I found these at Amazon I was cutting the filter bags open and putting new charcoal in to extend the usable life of the C filters. Now I can dispose of them as they were intended to be.
These arrived as six filters in a box, no individual packaging for the filters.  Small pieces of charcoal were all over the place inside the box, stuck in the mesh side of the filters and falling all over when I opened the box.  For the price it seems to be a good deal, but I wonder how much charcoal I lost from the filters while in shipping.  I doubt I'll go this route again simply because of the mess made by the loose charcoal.  Price wise it was the cheapest way to get filters for my penguin but I went with a refillable cartridge and washable mesh and I'm going to start making my own filters, works out to be even cheaper than these.
Standard filters that have been working just fine for nearly a year now.  I keep two filters in my Bio Wheel system at a time.  After about six-eight weeks I'll switch out the dirtier (further back) one with the front one, which I'll replace with a new filter.  This helps keep the needed bacteria in the media while still changing out filter as they get too dirty.  Also, I face the blue filter portion away from the tank.  I was unsure at the start of running our tank, but it makes sense to me now that the water should travel through the blue portion first and leave behind all the junk, then filter through the black back slit area.
Excellent, 100% guaranteed. Arrived fast and a super-amazing precione. Respuestos Penguin 100 (mini) brings six respuestos box.Super fine: to place this filter (again) in the penguin, you only need to give it a quick wash for 10 seconds (even with the same aquarium water) so that the sponge wipe a little blue and activated charcoal ... After this, it gets into the filter and ready .. So easy and simple. (This filter takes about 4-5 weeks) and wash interval is 1 or 2 times.A tips, if you check in detail the Amazon site, you can buy the activated charcoal and blue mesh, just trim a mesh box puts a 7-9 carbon stones (medium or small) and just sew .. (easy ). and even can save so much more, but I say these respuestos a good price.Thanks,
I use these filters in my Bio-wheel that I have on my 30 gallon bowfront. This company makes outstanding filters that help keep your fish healthy and your tank cleaner. I have a 6 year old black ghost knife fish and some breeding cory cats in my tank, and I have never had poor water quality or disease thanks in part to this filter. I wish I could get my knife fish into a bigger tank, but even though I can't he at least has great water quality thanks to this product.
I have a Marineland Hex 5-Gallon Tank with one Betta in it at all times. These filters work beautifully and they're easy to install.I used to just put pieces of cut up sponge in the filter to save a little money, but I found the water would turn cloudy and algae would grow much faster after each water change.I replace my filter once a month, and prefer to use some of the filter media from a previous use so I'm not introducing a new filter by itself. I cut off the blue top of the filter and place it on top of the new filter. Been doing this for months with no issues.Will continue to buy for my aquarium.
These small "bales" of hay always come tightly packed, fresh & full of all the yummy tastes our piggies love. I have tried a few different brands of Timothy Hay & thus far I keep coming back to Kaytee as my tried & true brand. As jam packed as these mini-bales come I never feel cheated of product nor is there ever an inconsistency in quality, no seemingly foreign pieces floating amidst the hay like unknown twigs, sprigs or the alike. Trust me Ive found things like that in other companies hay so I would def. recommend this product for your guineas. We use the hay as a snack mid day for our pigs after their pellet breakfast and on average give one large handful per two pigs to nibble on. We have four pigs total so on average a bale lasts us about 2 weeks.
Kaytee is by and far one of the laziest manufacturers of pet products I've encountered. I work at a pet store, and have had ferrets in one of their cages that hated every second, and a guinea pig that hated their food and hay. Their cages are poorly designed, their hay is unhealthy and dry and lacking a lot of the proper nutrients, and they are, in my experience, generally all-around awful. KMS is the best you can get aside from straight from a farm, though Oxbow is good, too. Whatever you do, don't go with Kaytee. Treat your pets right!
As a natural no preservatives product that is naturally sun cured you will have to expect color variations, sometimes it will arrive nice and green other times it will be brown. This is not a lower quality food it is just part of the natural process and your animals will get the nutrients they need from it, hay is primarily used for its high fiber content in addition to other food types and this hay is a second cutting, medium length hay. It is great for small animals like rabbits and guinea pigs. They will not mind if it is green nor if it is brown, we are the ones that add colors to our foods to make them more appetizing, animals don't have those concerns.At $7 for a 24 oz bag it is a bit steep, but Amazon usually has pretty good sells going on that will beat out petco. So unless you live near a feed store and want to buy a proper sized bail this is going to be a good way to go.
Long before the hay's expiration date it started to smell sour so I had to throw half of the package away. I might have gotten a defective bag but I wanted to let potential buyers know.I was using it for dwarf hamsters, who do not use a lot of hay at one time, and after about a month and half is when I noticed the sour smell coming from the bag.*after thought note: my sister purchased a large bag of Kaytee Timothy Hay for her rabbits from another store and had the same problem. About 2 months into the bag she noticed a very strong sour smell coming from the hay.
I bought this hay for a year because I could pick it up at Wal Mart, I could subscribe to it on Amazon, and I thought it was reasonably priced. After finding a local feed store and searching further on Amazon, I feel that I have found the light.Kaytee brand hay is full of dust and tiny pieces that end up being wasted rather than consumed and creating a big mess if your animal lives inside.Not only is it cheaper per oz to buy in bulk, feed store hay (or even Standlee Premium Western Forage that can be purchased through Amazon) is WAY better quality that you can see, and that your animals will prefer.
I have been using copper safe for years because it's such a great value in my opinion. It lasts and works for 30 days, so you can add fish to the aquarium while the tank is being treated to ensure you are not bringing more problems into the tank. I also like it because it removes chlorine and the filters do not have to come out as long as the filters with carbon are older than 5 days. The larger size it the best value for me as I have many larger tanks and the special design in the bottle makes it easier to measure and keep track. Although it is blue in color, it does NOT change the color of the water in the tank. Copper safe gets rid of a lot of diseases for your fish especially the most common ICK or white spot disease. I hope this helps my fellow aquarium enthusiests, Enjoy! :)
Got one of these for my 3 year old Lab/Husky mix since she is always trying to steal my 2 year old Shepherd/Husky mix's Nylabone chew. She loves it! She used to not chew on toys much, but I guess after seeing how much fun her little brother had, she decided to join in. I have had good experiences with other Nylabone products, especially the fact they have been very durable. After several hours of heavy chewing, just the top is frilly and chewed. Haven't had any problems with them breaking either.
This works fantastic for my husky to chew on!  It's a great alternative to raw hide and doesn't show as much wear as quickly as a raw hide does.  He isn't able to break it apart and just gnaws it down slowly over time.  Whenever he is walking around looking for something to chew on we give him this or his nylabone dinosaur (another great chew, but didn't last as long as this one).  I'd say we finally threw this out after about 2-3 months of chewing.  (We decided to throw it out when it was short enough that it looked like he could probably swallow it.)
I have a 70 lb chow/terrier mix who loves to chew and loves toys. I recently got him a bone at a pet store and he loved it, so I figured that the Nylabone souper would be a hit. Well, it arrived today, and he does enjoy it, but maybe a little too much. In the span of a few hours, he's managed to get an entire chunk off the smaller end. He made about as much progress on the natural bone in this time, and it was a cheaper. I think I'll probably just stick with the natural bones from now on.  As a side note, I had a dachshund before this pup. I bought the dachshund the Nylabone variety pack and he destroyed them all pretty quickly as well. Maybe I have just been blessed with ultra-aggressive chewers?
I have a very active and sweet Border Collie mix who loves chasing and chewing. I try hard to match his energy level, and for the most part succeed, but there are times when I just can't. This Nylabone is perfect for keeping him busy during those times when I can't be playing fetch or chasing him around the house or yard. My only slight concern is whether a hard chewer can crack or break their teeth, or damage their gums during excessively hard and long chewing sessions. Excellent product.
I never liked nylabones before I got them for my dogs. They always seemed dirty, hair sticks to the ends after they've been chewed and dogs will make their gums bleed chewing them. But my dogs make quick work of any chewy (they finish even very large edible chewies in less than one minute), so we got the durable nylabones and the dogs love to chew them. They are not indestructable but they last for months even with daily use. The dogs do make their gums bleed chewing them at first but I was surprised to see how clean their teeth are now. A good thing to have for a serious chewer.
My adult German Shepherd destroys things quickly as all GSD like to do. My vet recommended the Nylabone as it was supposed to be good for her teeth, so I got one, but it ended up chipping off about half of one of her little front teeth. In addition, once some chewing has occurred, the bone gets a lot of hard, sharp jagged edges that can cut both the dog's gums and my hands.It is definitely durable and my dog loved to chew on it, but I'd rather spend more money and have her go through a bunch of softer chew toys than to find more broken teeth. Also worth noting is that a different reviewer also mentioned a broken tooth.
Quote Ziggy on this bone.My 60 pound boxer/pit mix is a fan. It's no stick or real bone, but it seems to be the next best thing.  He's been chewing on it on and off for a few weeks and hasn't gotten far which is nice.  I guess he likes the different textures and shapes, but I can't telepathically talk to the pooch so I just take the chew marks for what they are.It doesn't smell and it doesn't get slimy. 3 weeks of him chewing on it and it's still in great shape, so it's lasting a while too.
I foster dogs, and have purchased many a Nylabone. If you have a dog that is driving you crazy and he/she doesn't have a Nylabone, buy one now! Most dogs have a need to chew. If you don't give them something of their own to chew on, they are going to chew on your things or their need will manifest itself in other ways, like excessive energy that drives you crazy.  It's really important to give your dog toys, and I really recommend the Nylabones.  The ends get nasty as the dogs chew on them, this is normal.  I have this size, which is predominantly chewed on my pitbull.  It is just under 8 inches long. You are definitely going to get your money worth from this Nylabone, or any others you choose.
The Durachew Souper size is perfect for my pit mix. He enjoys both the original and bacon flavors. He chews them several times every day for about 15-20 minutes at a time. And after about 4 months, they are only beginning to get worn down. They do make shavings that get stuck to carpets and things, and fuzz/hair/etc gets stuck on them like velcro, but these and Kongs are the only things that don't get destroyed immediately. My dog (who likes to rip his toys apart and eat the pieces) hasn't tried to break and eat any pieces off these. He just chews until his jaws get tired. After he's done with his current bones, I might try the Big Chews for Big Dogs size of Nylabone.Nylabones are worth every penny.
We still watch them with these bones like we do any bone to make sure nothing breaks off but these are by far the most strongest bones to date we have fond.  Our dogs love them and we love them too.  They are heavy and durable.  We give them to our pup's for about 20 minutes at a time and than distract them to something else.  We never leave them alone with the bones in their crates while we are gone.We have had the bones over a month and the puppies are very excited to chew each time offered as a treat and they will probably last a very long time.
This was just the ticket for my 50lb. terrier-sheepdog mix!  He has been doing some hardore chewing and this bone has really held up for a long time.  I usually replace them with a fresh one every couple of months and never once has pieces been broken off.  His chewing just creates a raised surface, its more like it reshapes rather than breaks off if that makes any sense.  This is a great product and will continue to buy the dura chew bones for my dog!
This is the same type Nylabone you'll find at the store but at a better price. Good for doggie teeth while chewing too. My Rottweiler and German Shepherd Dog usually need a new one every month or two since it does wear down (like any chew toy) but I like that it cleans teeth as it does and I've never seen either dog break off a piece anywhere near big enough to choke on, unlike a lot of rubber toys. Also doesn't create the display that rope toys do when it's time to clean up after your dog outside. One of about 2 or 3 toys I try to keep around at all times for the boys to work on so they leave our shoes and such alone :)
