I bought three of these 5/8-inch Flexogen hoses--50, 75, and 100 feet--for different areas of yard around the house.  After a season of use they've proven to be good hoses.  Of course, it's very favorable that they don't leak.  But what particularly impresses me about them is their notably light weight and flexibility, which make them a lot easier to handle than my previous hoses.  The flexibility diminishes in cold weather, but a garden hose is less useful then anyway.They're not especially prone to kinking, but they're not kink-proof, either, nor do they claim to be.  They kink a lot less than one of my old hoses and more than a couple of others, but the latter were fairly stiff, so there was a trade-off.Bottom line:  this was a good purchase.
This is one tough hose and it is thick and stiff.The connections are strong and the hose is industrial strength.I bought this to use with my pressure washer because it is 8 ply and 3/4 inch wide.My old hose was just rubber and it was flexing and twisting and there is no way this hose is going to do that.The hose is warrantied for life and unless there is a problem with a leak i don't think i will ever need to use it.The local big box stores do not sell a 3/4 50 foot hose and my pressure washer will not operate with anything longer than 50 feet.The price and delivery were great and Amazon is the best around if there is ever a concern.
It looks like it came right out of an episode of Leave It To Beaver but don't be fooled by this retro-looking nozzle. This feels great in my hand and functions way better than the plethora of nozzles I have tried in the past. The trigger has a real nice, snappy, feel to it.Unlike my other nozzles that are made from plastic, I actually think this will survive a winter outdoors in PA. The only thing I have to get used to is that the type of spray is determined by the pressure I apply on the trigger. Everything else about it is perfect.
This is a nice hose nozzle - simple design, sturdily made and inexpensive. It can go from high-powered jet mode to gently spray just by loosening your grip. It also doesn't leak at all where it attaches to the hose!My only gripe would be that when you use the widest spray pattern, it can come out unevenly &#8211;e.g., it's not an even &#34;circle&#34; of water coming out, which makes watering evenly a little challenging. But it's not a big deal.Get one, you'll like it.
After hearing so much about this unit, and seeing a couple of them in my neighborhood, I decided to give it a try, even though the price was higher than I ever expected to pay for a lawn sprinkler.I now know why so many  people like it.  It is very effective in watering the lawn, without  spraying water high up in the air (less chance for evaporation, and not  affected by wind as much), and it has hands-off operation once you set it  up.Adjusting the spray diameter is easy, and using the hose as a way to  set the travel path for the sprinkler to follow is a great idea.  The  adjustable speed allows you to decide how much water to apply and how much  ground you want to cover in a period of time.Inspecting the yard  afterwards shows that the ground is nicely saturated, and not needing to go  out and move hoses is a welcomed change. This sprinkler is worth the  purchase price!
The Gilmour Flexogen is definitely the best hose I've ever had, and they are made in the USA.  Thanks Gilmour!  Mine stay outdoors year round (we have mild winters with only a few freezes per year, but very long, hot summers). They are very durable and don't kink.  I have never had a reason to take advantage of the lifetime warranty, but other reviewers indicate that Glimour makes good on their promise even decades later.  I've noticed a few negative reviews here where the reviewer is mistakenly commenting on a completely different hose.
I read all the positive reviews and was excited about it. Now im excited to replace it with a plastic rain bird sprinklerPros: Solid build, strong material construction, quick performer, very easy to adjust the spray pattern.Cons: It does not have a gasket on the bottom thread so youll need to add some plumber's tape to get a solid seal. It has some overspray that goes beyond the spray pattern which is disappointing if you wanna keep from wasting water. Expensive! At this price, I could have purchased two plastic Rain Bird sprinklers.Other: I recently tested three different impact sprinklers (on video) and so far the best seems to be the plastic rain bird, youll see my video review from youtube this one and the plastic one if you view the plastic one.
I've had 2 of these now for 3 years and they work really well.  The range is not quite 41 feet, but that's probably due to my water pressure. i'd say its closer to 30 at most.  another impact sprinkler i have goes a few feet further, but it's not the biggest deal.  The positives about this are that it's very solid- i've never had a problem with it not operating properly, and it seems to spray the area very effectively. Considering that they're going on 3 years now, i'd buy them all over again with no hesitation.
I used to use a really primitive manual edger that I inherited from my father. Blistered hands and time wasted, I decided there had to be a better way and this is surely it.Edging is one of those necessary evils if you want a great looking house. I don't edge every time I mow. Usually I do it every other time. The first time out after a long winter, edging usually takes a little longer. After that, edging is a snap because you are basically in maintanence mode.I also use this around my landscaping and flower beds with equally great results.The blade on the Edge Hog is easily replaceable and the tell tale sign to replace it is when the edge starts to look a little rough and the machine seems slower.
The Black & Decker LE750 Edge Hog 2-1/4 HP Electric Landscape Edger is so easy to use and does a great job of edging my lawn. I purchased this edger because I became so tired of trying to edge my lawn with a string trimmer. The string trimmer did a choppy job, but the B&D edger makes a nice and neat edge on my lawn. Before this purchase I dreaded the job. The fact that this edger can also make trenches is a big plus. I am a female senior citizen and care for my lawn myself. Anything that makes that job easier (like this edger) deserves five stars. I highly recommend this product to anyone who needs an edger that is easy to use and does a good job.
I love this edger!  I have been using it for almost 2 years, and it is still going strong.  It has plenty of power, yet is easy to maneuver.I get a beautiful, straight edge along my sidewalk from using this tool.  It is so easy to guide in a straight line.  I also use it to keep a trench space between my grass and my landscaped areas, which has worked much better than a trimmer.We had a gas powered edger before this one, but it was too heavy for me.  I actually enjoy yard work, but rarely did it because the tools we had were difficult for me to manage.  Now that I have this electric edger, which is significantly lighter without the gas tank, as well as a manual mower, I do most of the yard work, and love it!
If you need an edger, and don't want the trouble of maintaining a gas-powered edger, this is the electric edger for you. It's more powerful than most, and sturdy as all heck. But it's also pretty light, too. Very easy to move around the yard.This tool is as indespensible as my lawn mower. If you're edging your lawn with a string trimmer, or not edging your lawn at all, you'll love the results you can get so easily with this edger.
This is the direct replacement part for the B&D; Grass Hog model NST2018.  I love that trimmer as it is easy to use and I don't have to fight with a gas powered trimmer and all the problems involved with using one.  This replacement spool directly fits onto the trimmer and is easy to change.  The trimmer is designed to automatically feed the trimmer line and I didn't want to mess with rewinding line onto the old spool.For me the 30 foot spool will last a whole cutting season or more and it is just easier to deal with than buying trimmer line and winding it yourself.  This is a good buy and works well.  I recommend it to you!
So what did you want to know? I started my trimming carrier with the Black & Decker Automatic Feed Spool (AFS). It is just plug and go. I prefer my trimmer string to come from Black & Decker. This way I will not come unraveled trying to use some cheap substitute. The spools last longer than expected. But all good things come to an end and you don't want to be half way through the yard when you find yourself strung out.Black & Decker CMM1200 19-Inch 24-Volt Cordless Electric Mulching Lawn Mower
I easily get two years out of a spool of this string while cutting both grass and weeds on my 18v trimmer.  It cuts clean and level and does not shred even on the harder stuff.  On rare occasions you may just break a little of the end off but that just tears away cleanly on your next trim, so no cutting of the line is necessary.  Yes, it is cheaper to just buy the line and wind it yourself, but for roughly $4 and some change it is hardly worth your time and effort.
For years, I lived with a Black & Decker trimmer that required hand-winding of the line spool.  What a fiasco!  Once the factory-wound spool ran out, the line never again fed properly.  No matter how much care one took with the hand-winding, the line always broke off prematurely -- from having gotten jammed up.  I spent at least as much time rewinding the spool as I did trimming grass.  Then I found the model Black & Decker trimmer that takes disposable spools -- like these.  They're a godsend.  Perhaps it's more economical to wind your own spool, but if your time (and blood pressure) mean anything to you, disposable spools are the way to go.  (And the manufacturer says you CAN hand-wind these spools if you like -- so you won't be stuck if you don't happen to have a fresh disposable spool on hand.)
I made the mistake of taking the spool that came with my B & D LST136 cordless trimmer and experienced what it would be like if I tried to save money by buying cord in bulk and winding my own spools.  I painstakingly wound the cord from left to right and from right to left as instructed in the manual.  I dropped it a few times and had to begin again.  I did it right because the cord does advance automatically in my trimmer, but I have to say I am glad I purchased spools that are already wound.  When I have to replace the spool that came with the trimmer, I will be careful to hold the cord tightly against the spool!
It was a little smaller than I expected, but that was actually a plus in my book. It feels durable and I like the fact that there is not a bug tray for collecting dead bugs. If you were using this on your deck or something, may that would be a different story, but you are really not supposed to use it where you will be sitting anyway. I sprinkled a pile of dietamaceous earth underneath this on the ground so that any crawling bugs like ants that come to feast on the new fried bug bits will meet their demise as well.
I recently received this product and just put it out yesterday.  It seems to be working wonderfully and there was a pile of dead insects this morning to show for it!!  I will post again if I have any compaints...but don't really anticipate any.  12/30/08  I now have a complaint!  The light in this unit was faulty.  It still comes on but the light is yellow and not white like it's suppose to be and it doesn't attrack the insects now. The light went out about 2 months ago so it wasn't but maybe 4 months old. 7/27/09 I ordered a replacement bulb on March 22, 2009 to get ready for the mosquito season...today is 7/27/09 and that bulb burned out 2 days ago! 4 month life span...AMAZING!  Needless to say...I WON'T be replacing it again at a cost of $21.99.....and will be looking for another bulb that will work in this unit.
Only draw back I could come up with is my girlfriend is convinced the light is attracting more bugs from the neighborhood. lol.  We have a pool and a pond, along with wetlands on our property, so we simply have a lot of bugs.  This thing is working constantly while it is on.  The zapping can get quite loud, but it is doing its job.  We have it set up about 20 feet from out deck, and 15 from the pool.  You don't want it closer, as it will bring bugs around.  They are attracted to it...which is exactly what you want! Just not right next to you.  Cord it short, so you will need a heavy duty extension cord.  I hung mine on  a trellis, but if you don't have something to hang it from, you may need a sturdy stand...this things is pretty massive, and has some weight to it.
Let me start by saying DO NOT BUY STINGER!!!  I bought 2 from Wally World and both are dead within a week.  I mean the light is barely visible already and it is no longer attracting insects.  I bought them because they were less expensive basically to save a buck.  I ended up throwing them away and buying 2 of these to replace them.I already have been using a Flowtron 1 Acre in one corner of my house for the past 4 years and it is on all the time.  It has been incredibly reliable and effective.  These are the only Electronic Insect Killers I recommend.
....to really tell if it works as we are short of mosquitos this year and I have not attached the bait that comes with it to attract what there are.  I have had several of these in the past and they proved effective and this should be the same.  Bulb cost is minimal thought limits advertised effectiveness to a half acre.  I'm not sure how they figured that out but our deck is 20 feet from a small pond that hatches these guys and this little machine should be OK to zap 'em.
This light is pretty worthless.  It kills lots of moths and other non-biting bugs but didn't put a dent in the mosquito or fly population.  I got this as an alternative to my unreliable SkeeterVac but it does not work and is equally unreliable.  The bulbs blew after 1 season.  Replacement bulbs are $40 each plus shipping.  It takes 2.  That is $90 for 2 bulbs and I only paid $80 for the whole unit.  Thanks but no thanks.Unfortunately, the only thing I've found that actually catches mosquitoes is the propane powered devices.  They are all unreliable too.  Skip the zappers and traps and use deet.
SO living on a mini ranch I got this to cut down on flies and mosquitoes.  The mosquito attractant did a good job, but didn't last that long, and was expensive to replace. The pesky "flies" go to bed at night so they aren't attracted to it.  Otherwise it would just attract "non pesky" bugs in my opinion like moths and I felt really bad hearing them sizzle and zap when they didn't bother me. One night I went out and noticed there was a lot of moths and huge ones all around the bug zapper. I felt like they were trying to tell bugs and moths to stay away, so I took it down.. I know I am crazy and too kind but I kinda believe in Karma and not hurting anything unless it hurts me so I will just use it for bbq's and times where I am outside, and make sure I have the mosquito attractant.. I know I am crazy, but that is how I feel :)
Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent, but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room.
We just received this unit this week, and can already note an improvement in our yard. We have used dunks for some water gardens we have, and have been impressed with the Flowtron unit thus far. A lot of dead mosquitoes every morning. We hook it up to an outdoor timer and run the unit automatically from dusk to dawn.  It will take about three weeks for all the eggs to hatch and mature then we'll see a great reduction in mosquitoes.It's been a very wet in North Texas and we have a bumper crop this year. Am going to explore mixing up some hot pepper and garlic--recipes are available online as a barrier. We hope a combination on factors can help rid us of a heavy mosquito population. Have not noticed any beneficial insects on or under the grids.We compared brands and sizes and selected this one due to reviews of others on Amazon. Recommend the bigger wattage for better attraction of flying insects--with mosquitoes being our main target.
We use these loppers for our habitat restoration work at the Nature Conservancy's Ives Road Fen Preserve.  They can cut a fairly large bush or sapling.  After 100 hours or so of use the linkages wear.  After more hours the fiberglass handles become flexible and fracture where the rivets go through them.  We have figured out how to rebuild/repair both of these areas.  In seven years two blades have broken.  Replacement blades can be purchased from the Corona website.  A homeowner using these would have no problems in a lifetime of use.  These are the best combination of high capability and low cost that we have found.  The anvil type blade can be easily sharpened with a hand-held angle sharpener.
At first I didn't like this Corona pruner because it didn't seem to cut well.  Then I realized the source of the problem was me.  I was pruning deadwood inside a hedge with little clearance for the handles, so the jaws were not fully open and the cuts were being made near the tip of the blade and anvil.  User error.  Not only did the pruner cut poorly in this position, but also the blade tended to twist.  Finally I figured out this pruner comes into its own when cutting deep in the V.  That is where its power comes into play and that is where the pruner works very well. Not sure why the difference, but there it is.  So now I know to reserve this Corona pruner for when its jaws can be opened wide, and to use a smaller pruner or a small saw for tight spaces.
the first thing that happened was that the two end caps fell off. where? i don't know. but i hope to find them. i really think this is a 1 inch capacity lopper. in my experience there is no way this can cut 2 inches of wood. what kind of wood can it cut 2 inches of? yes it is a great tool but for 1 inch branches or less. i am happy that i bought it but it is for light duty and it does a great job of light duty work. i have been outside clearing a lot of branches and brush and i cannot ever see this cutting 2 inches of anything.
I lost my pruners in a move and had let my plants get sadly overgrown while I was SURE I was going to find my old pruners. Finally, my front yard looked pretty ridiculous and I came here in search of relatively inexpensive bypass pruners. I read lots of reviews and decided to go with this, and I'm glad I did. I had no problem using these to cut small branches and bushes. The handle felt comfortable in my (fairly small) hands, it hasn't stuck or jammed, and they feel like they're made to last. Thanks for steering me right, other reviewers. :)
I managed to get this stuff wrapped around all my fruit trees last year (quite a job - it snagged on all the branches and even my buttons, but with the help of another person and two long poles, we did it.)  I guess it worked well enough but I will never use it again since it doesn't just keep birds away, it traps them.  I managed to spot and free a bluebird and a cardinal that had become entangled, before they died of thirst or were found by cats.  But then one day I found a bluebird all dried up hanging from the netting - poor thing, what a horrible way to die.  :(  I want to protect my fruit, but I don't want to kill songbirds, certainly not slowly over a period of days.  So I am going to try some of those products that are supposed to merely scare them away, not kill them.
We bought the Garden Claw several years ago at our first house and never used it, because the handles are mounted for lefties.  That is, the two hand-grips are each curved to the side, giving a feel of turning a wheel when you use it.  This would be great if you put your hands on the grips and turned it to the right to dig.  But the tines on this gadget are positioned so that you have to "steer" the Claw to the left to get them to dig.  Since us righties have more strength in our right hands, it was very awkward to "steer" the Claw to the left.  We spent about 20 minutes with it in the garden that day and haven't used it since.
This is a handy tool for cultivating small areas, but it is not appropriate for anything more than a medium sized flowerbed.  The handles work well to gain leverage, but you will feel it in your muscles if you  attempt to do too large an area!The fact that it isn't powered lets  you get into areas you wouldn't want to go with even the smallest of  tillers, and it does a great job of breaking up the ground to a depth of a  couple of inches, which is perfect for flowers.For larger projects, use  a mini-tiller, and use this tool for the detail work and the smaller beds.  Both tools are a good combination to have at your disposal.
Currently I hate this thing.  I may need to oil it/adjust it or make some other modifications but it squeaks of metal on metal and cuts about 1/3rd of the grass I pass over with it.  I found a manual mower like this in the yard of the first home I bought and used it for years.  It was better than any mower I've ever owned.  This seems to perform like a cereal box toy imitation of what a manual push mower is supposed to be like.  Pooptastic.  I will update this review if I am able to modify it to actually cut grass, but out of the box it seems to make far too many blade passes per distance traveled to ever perform well.  Also the last model I had had two counter-rotating blades and this only has one rotating in one direction against a stationary blade/block.
It's a classic all right, but a clever classic.  This mower is a straight forward push reel mower with a few nice touches.  That second set of wheels replace a roller all right and the clever height adjustment let's you know that someone gave some thought to this device.  One of the one-star complaints regarding this mower involves the difficulty pushing it.  Well, you can alleviate that by simply adjusting the closeness of the blade  or even the angle of the cut; mine was initially a real bear because the blade was factory adjusted to such a closeness that the reel blades added enormously to the drag, far more than the grass did.  Once you've tapped in an adjustment to the closeness of the blade to its stropping plate (remember just 1/4 turn at the most and oil all the blades) it'll be close to effortless.  The main thing, however, is that reel mowers do such a pretty cut.
I am a avid gardener, I take care of the flowers and my husband takes care of the lawn.  We have had too many cases of lawmmower blight;by definition - the weed wacker or lawn mower cuts down my flowers and bushes.  After too many cases of lawnmower blight, I bought this little mower for trimming near my flower beds that are naturalized (lawnmower blight does not happen at mulched beds).This is a great tool!  Very sharp and easy to push, perfect for what I need it for.  At first my husband was slightly insulted by and for the reason of this pruchase, he even snickered when it came out of the box, but when he tried it he loved it and is now using it to trim by our driveway as is cuts lower than our "big" mower.Highly recommend for very small lawns and trimming, remember it is 14 inches wide.I JUST LOVE IT1
This is my second germination set I've ordered in the last two weeks.  This one is even flimsier than the other one by Hydrofarms.  However, the concept works:  place peat pots of seeds in a warm, humid environment and seeds will sprout.  I have mine on a heating pad under a grow lamp.  The peat pots only expanded to just under an inch.An aluminum pan with a clear lid would work just as well, as the metal would distribute the heat better.  I found the lid popped off easily so I check on it several times a day.  I have beans and turnips growing in my peat pots.With care I intend to reuse the pan and lid for multiple uses.  For new gardeners this is an effective way to grow seeds.  I could also place peat pots in sealed plastic bags for cheaper, though. I will report back in a week when the first seeds sprout.
I read the negative reviews and bought the trap anyway because I wanted a humane trap; just couldn't bring myself to kill the one mouse that seemed to have snuck into my house.  I posted a picture; the trap is smaller than a dollar bill.  I found that I was "waiting up" and checking the mousetrap every half hour, because any mouse that it caught would certainly die rather quickly in there.  A traditional mouse trap would be more humane if one couldn't release the catch within minutes of a trap.  I never did catch a mouse with it; I grew tired of checking the thing too often...I wish the trap were just a little bit bigger... but as it is, it is too small for a mouse to live for more than a few minutes.
Having read reviews of several different live traps, had no idea which was best.  So, bought about 4 different ones.  THIS ONE WORKED.  Put them all out with peanut butter and had no sign of any activity except this one.  Didn't know how many mice we had, but caught three with this one and zero with the others and no escapes, it seems, from the others.  They were all put in the same general area.  This one worked, was easy to set, easy to bait and easy to release the mouse.
I've owned two of these feeders and my only complaint with the first one is that the yellow &#34;flowers&#34; come out too easily and get lost.  This resulted in wasps, bees, etc being able to drink the liquid.  I had used it a few years and am supposing they aren't meant to last that long.I bought another one just like it and have had no issues so far.  Otherwise, great feeder with large capacity.  It is very heavy, so I suggest hanging from your porch or a limb.
I don't have any problems with this and neither do the birds. We fill it with a sugar/water mix rather than feeding the poor little critters a load of crummy additives, they really don't care that the water isn't red and the artificial coloring is suspected of giving them health issues.Anyway, I just unscrew it from the cap when I want to clean and fill it, then empty any remaining solution down the drain in the yard and wash it off with the hose before taking it indoors (sugar water really attracts dirt in a carpet, ask me how I know).I have not found it difficult to clean. Once refilled I take it out again, still upside down, and then turn it over before anything significant can leak out. Then just screw it back in to the cap.
I swapped out my old plastic hummingbird feeders for this glass one because the plastic ones kept getting moldy and were so hard to clean. This feeder is way too large for my liking, you need a lot (tons!) of sugar syrup to fill it up. It also took a week for my hummingbirds to go near this feeder and even now it's their second choice to my other smaller feeder. I don't think they like the perches, as they loved my old feeders which didn't have perches. And I don't think they are very attracted to this feeder due to its flat yellow flowers, instead of the pretty raised ones you get on other feeders.
Tthese little gems are O.K. and do work well to keep bees of most kinds out of the nectar; however, there is just no humane way to rid one's yard of bees.  Even though bees are a pain and create a problem for some hummingbirds these guards manage to keep the bees at bay.  Our hummers just look at the bees gathered around the guards and laugh at them while eating the nectar.  Typical of most predators the bees attempt to chase the birds but success falls to the birds.One minor problem with the guards is that some insects are small enough to enter the mesh but too stupid to figure a way out and thusly meet their demise.  When cleaning the mesh of the guards be sure to clean the inside as well.
These did not fit my feeder, but I super-glued them in place. The "basket" part also falls off of the "stem" part ...but I super-glued them in place. The bees will find any small place not covered by glue, so if you try this work-around, be sure to put it on thick...a gel works best. I secured with masking tape to let it dry, too.I like feeding bees, and they have their own plate of sugar water, but I also want my hummingbirds happy. I also hate it when the bees get carried away and drown themselves. Trying to get them out while they are still alive is tricky, although they don't sting when wet with sugar water. This is helping.Today, a new problem: my tall dog can reach the feeder with his nose and is tipping it to drink from it, bees and all. These guards won't solve all problems, I guess!
My order arrived promptly and in perfect condition. Excellent packaging!Quality of Gauge was evident -- solid brass fittings, clear 0-200 lb. increments and metric scale (atmospheres).A special Flat Rubber Washer (included) prevents leaks and helps keep water out of the housing. BE SURE the flat rubber washer is in place and fitting is tight to the spigot or manifold before water is turned on !! Don't dare lose that Flat Washer, 'cause a regular Hose Washer won't work !!IF you have installed the Flat Washer and tightened the Fitting properly before turning on the water -- and you see water inside the gauge, turn it off and SEND IT BACK as defective. Amazon's Returns Policy is the best in the on-line retail business, so it's a hassle-free deal to get an exchange or refund.Good Luck !!
Attaches to any regular outside spicket or your washing machine line.  Seems to read ok, but I'm not 100% sure because I do not have anything to compare it too.  I think it would be beneficial to have a professional with professional tools measure the pressure as well to ensure the most accurate reading.The one negative I have is that the gauge fills up with water under the glass.  I'm not sure if mine is defective or if they are all that way, but I would think the water should not seep in like that.
I needed a relatively short garden hose and this APEX REM 15-foot hose fit the bill at a reasonable price. This Amazon item sells various remnants (i.e. left-overs from longer hoses) so what you get is not necessarily matches the stock photo. I am attaching a photo (under customer photos) of the hose I received - a green light-duty 3-ply hose. It looks just like many longer hoses I bought a local home improvement store. It is 15-feet by 5/8 inches. The hose is reinforced and comes with standard brass couplings. The couplings made good connections and do not leak even without Teflon tape.The hose came tightly wrapped which caused some kinks in the hose - I highlighted two of them in the attached photo. However, after several days in the sun with water running through the hose the kinks are working themselves out and the water flow is not impeded significantly.Overall, I am pleased with this purchase.Ali Julia review
I purchased three of these via Amazon (free delivery) for $8 each and back for more. Great value! I use them in combination with a 4 way connector set and adjustable sprinklers to water each of my raised garden beds with just one quick turn of the hose. Not only are they a much better quality than the sets supposedly created to do the same thing but the price is competitive too. Just the right size to daisy chain sprinklers and reduces the time required to tend the garden...perfect for raised garden beds where regular sprinkler system might be over-kill.UPDATE - I noticed many people complaining over quality...for the record I received the Black hose remnants as pictured. From the sound of it, there are various colors and quality issues. The black ones are very good quality with brass fittings.
This is a short piece of hose.  It may not be the colour shown, so don't buy it if you're using it for decorative purposes.  If you want it to function, it will.Yes, it has a plastic washer instead of rubber.  If you would happen to have a leaking problem, just add some teflon tape (which you should be doing to all your pressurized hose joints anyway as a precautionary measure) - it only costs a few cents a roll.As this is the cheapest such item to serve its purpose, it gets my recommendation.[Mine is red and green, apparently for Christmas].
I've had the same brush for 4 years now. This brush is great. The wooden handle is sturdy, doesn't heat up, and is long enough that you can clean your grill while it's hot (how I usually do it) My one complaint with it is since there is no angle at the head, you end up putting the brush at an angle (since you can't hold it perpendicular to the grill as that would defeat the point of the 18" handle) which means only the bristles at the very front get used. My brush has the front brass bristles worn down and full of grill gunk but 2/3rds of the bristles in the back look brand new. If the head of the brush was at an angle to the handle this brush would be way better.That said, it's still a good brush.Be careful though as it seems Amazon is combining the reviews between the version of this brush that has brass bristles with the version with steel bristles.
Before, when I went to buy a new brush I would always get the cheapies; I thought they were all the same, except some came in plastic while others came in wood or aluminum. I was wrong. You do get what you pay for when buying a grill brush, so buy this one! The bristles are stiff enough to clean up all the grit, yet soft enough to not damage your grate. The brush feels nice and sturdy, it feels well built. Also, this brush has a handy scraper on the end which is extremely handy with the really tough crusties (on your GRILL silly).
Ive had this same grill for about 8 years now and its as nice now as the day I got it. Its big enough to cook pretty much whatever you need to cook on it, of course if you have a lot to cook it may take a little longer. Ive always had everything cook very evenly with more than sufficient burn time with coals. This grill is also small enough that you can take it with you for camping or going on your boat for a bbq on the beach (I just use a bungy cord to secure the lid) . If I need to rid of the coals I just put water on them turn the grill upside down and cover the coals in dirt, if the grill is still hot ill throw some more water on it then wipe it down and off we go..This grill isnt heavy so you can easily dump out the ashes in your trash can or where ever with minimal effort. Very great grill for the price and perfect for pretty much anyone!
I see some reviews state that this is just a smaller version of the larger kettle grills&#8230; and that&#8217;s not quite true. This one is not portable unless you grab the whole grill&#8230; there&#8217;s no way to pick up the whole unit by the handle. The kettles have a handle and wheels so you can roll it around&#8230;once lit this unit isn&#8217;t going anywhere. Also, there&#8217;s no place to put the lid once it&#8217;s removed&#8230; the kettles have a hook so you can hang the lid right on the kettle but all you can do with this one is lay it on a table or the ground. Other than that&#8230; it&#8217;s a perfect grill for the two of us, it&#8217;s easy to assemble, it&#8217;s built rugged and it&#8217;s easily worth 5-stars. I would have given it 4-stars had I not known beforehand that it cannot be moved with the handle&#8230; when it&#8217;s cold you can just throw a bungee cord on and you&#8217;re good to go.
You can tell these are quality grills; otherwise Weber wouldn't give these a 10 year warranty. My 20 year old Smokey Joe recently came to its demise and there was no doubt I'd purchase another. The only difference is they now have a nylon handle instead of a wooden handle. I keep mine outside on a patio 24/7/365 and it weathers the elements without covering it. I also use mine on an old metal wrought-iron table to make for safe grilling. This is the perfect size for 1-3 people.
We have a similar model One Touch Premium home (Germany) and the quality of Weber pays off. I brought the old chinese bbq to trash today ;-).The Weber is very solid build and comes ready to go with drop pans and charcoal holders (wires). Bought a chimney from Weber since the reviews were so good. Tried direct and indirect, keep on training.Will not to back to chinese quality again.Since we live in Northern Germany usage of this bbq is limited to summer time, completed with a Q200 grill.
Our gas grill finally rusted out after 15 years. I was ready to spend $700 on the 320 but started asking myself why? Grilling outside is for leisure, take your time, relax and enjoy the flavor. So I opted for this Weber One Touch Gold - what I have been missing all these years!This grill is so easy to use. I didn't get the chimney starter, I just place some newspapers under the charcoal and it works just fine. I am usually grilling in about 15 - 20 minutes. The ash collector is fantastic, the ashes don't blow around and it makes it easy to remove the leftover ashes. I got blue, it really looks great. The little hook inside the lid makes it easy to set it aside so you have both hands.This is going to be a great summer - now if we could just get some sun here in the NW!
I had alwayws wanted to get a barbeque grill ever since we bought our home last year. I had been debating between 751001 and 741001 for quite some time, finally decided to go with this one for its ash catcher and it turned out to be a wise decision. Installation of the grill was fairly easy even for me. We had three families of visitors when we tried it the 1st time, we cooked a lot of meat, pepper, corn and etc, it was awesome. We have used it three times already within the 1st 10 days after we received it, it's gonna get a lot more use this summer.
This grill is wonderful!  It cooks really evenly and the lid can hang on the side of the grill while tending to the food.  The hinged grate is great for adding wood chips for flavor.  The ash catcher makes for easy cleaning of the ashes and is worth the few extra bucks.  Our grill arrived in perfect shape and was very easy to assemble.  We use it almost every night.  This grill is sturdy and heats evenly and has the Weber name behind it.  We expect to be using it for many years.
I purchased this grill, but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed cooking on it.  With the chimney starter, it is almost as fast to get this grill ready to cook as it is to get a gas grill ready - and you should let your meat set out for about 20 minutes before you grill, so you really haven't lost that much time.The ash catcher is a great feature and don't forget to get the rotisserie attachment.  You haven't had turkey for thanksgiving until you've had a rotisserie turkey!Real Men cook with charcoal and wood and this is the best grill I've ever owned.
This is the best charcoal grill I have ever owned. I have cooked ribs at 225-250 and been able to control the fire easily. I used the 2-2-1 method on a rack of baby backs and never had to think about adding charcoal over 5 hours. By using the vents you can get wood chips to smolder for an hour and not flare up and burn away in minutes.  The ash pan holds at least three cooks worth of ashes and does not leak.  I feel comfortable cooking on my wooden deck because of the ash pan. The only addition i would make is the Craycort cast iron grate.
We had a gas grill for years but opted to go back to a charcoal grill.  This Weber grill made our decision easy.  Outstanding medium size grill for the two of us grilling several items and works well for 4 or more depending on what you need to prepare on the grill.  Suggest using the Weber Rapidfire Chiminey for starting your briquets...it's great and makes your job not only easier but the food taste better without the use of starter fluid.  Great grill....great name behind it!!
After our gas grill had to be retired, we decided to get a charcoal grill.  Weber has a reputation for having a solid product that will last for many years, and I have no doubt that we'll be using this for a long time.  But the legs seem to be made out of somewhat cheaper material than what we had when I was younger. Think I'll be getting the cover to protect it over the winter.This particular model doesn't have the one-touch ash catcher and after using this a few times, I'm kind of sorry we didn't go with that particular model.One person can put it together without help, athough it can be a struggle for a bit.Grilling?  Well that's exactly like you'd expect although I miss having a grated shelf to keep some items a little further from the charcoal.  That just requires a difference in how you mound the briskets.
I love this Weber One Touch Silver kettle. Seeing the kettles my relatives have, but made years earlier, i am pleased that years later, it still seems to be made with high quality steel, a good enamel and tight engineering. The handles have gone from wood to a resin, but they work well. Grilling or smoking, this unit has proven itself worth the money.I wrestled between buying the Silver or the Gold model, but what swayed me was that on Weber's site, the Silver shows "Made in USA" while the Gold does not. The reviewers for the Gold, here on Amazon, state that the box says "Assembled in USA", or something like that. The Weber site has no mention of any of it. I decided to avoid the issues that some with the Gold were reporting and I went with the Silver. It is very solid and I am glad I did.
This grill has one major flaw.....surprised it is still being sold due to product liability. The utterly inadequate ash/ember pan allows a mild breeze to blow the ash and embers out onto flamable surfaces...like your deck, your pine straw, or house. For an extra 50 bucks you can get an upgraded model that has an enclosed ash/ember containment system. If you live in areas prone to dryness or wildfires, you could be taking a big chance with this unsafe grill. I love the way a Weber cooks, but this model is needlessly risky.  And if you have one of these grills,  take precautions like putting a metal bucket under this grill. A paint can works nicely and you can buy clean empty paint cans at Lowes. This will help reduce the fire risk and will keep ash from blowing around wildly.....it also makes getting rid of ash an easy task. If you value the property you live in, or think you owe your neighbors some due diligence, avoid this flame thrower.
I love this grill. This is one of my four weber kettle grills I own.Assembly is a snap. The only tool you'll need is a hammer to tap the wheel lugs on. In 15 minutes you can be lighting your coal.The beauty of this grill is the kettle design which maximizes heat retention and allows the grill to act like an oven with the top on. I've cooked whole chickens, cabbage, bread, and pizza using this method. The top also has a hook on it so you can hang it from the side of the grill while you add sauce or tend to what you're cooking.For best results at indirect cooking, use the hinged 22 1/2 inch grate.  That way you can add coals throughout the cooking process without the danger of having to totally remove the cooking grate.
I've had the 18.5 Weber kettle for about 5 years and have been very happy with it. However, anyone shopping for a grill should consider the full-size, 22.5 grill.We bought the 18.5 because our family is small and I figured this would be plenty big enough. What I didn't consider was that a larger grill will give you lots of additional options for indirect cooking and smoking. The 18.5 just doesn't have the space, even for a small family. If you only want to cook burgers and hot dogs for 3 to 4 people, the 18.5 will serve fine but you won't have much versatility.Now that I've "grown" as a griller, I wish I had the One-touch Platinum. This model gives extra space, an ash catcher, temp gauge, sliding lid and 2 side tables. However, my 18.5 is still going strong after 5 years of steady use and sitting in the elements. Kinda difficult to justify the new grill when the old one is still in great shape.
I got this in addition to my Weber Genesis Platinum Grill. I love my Charcoal grill especially for those times when I want Steak, Burgers, Chicken, BBQ Chicken, for a great authentic taste. It heats quickly (Weber Chimney) about 20 minutes. It is easy to assemble, very sturdy and quite stable. Some reviewers noted they could not move with hot coals and food as it only has one handle. You should never move a hot grill of any kind. It should be used in a safe place away from combustable materials. The Weber Silver Kettle Grill is terrific and I use it almost regularly and in combination with my gas grill for a complete cooking experience outdoors. (I also have a smoker for the real low and slow cooking). The 18 1/2 inch cooking surface is excellent, and 2 zone and 3 zone is possible by adjusting the number of coals used and position. I did 2 zone cooking and all worked extremely well.
I caught over 18 rabbits, 1 squirrel and 1 feral cat with this trap within the first month of its use. The trap is well constructed and holds up to heavy abuse by the trapped animals. The only reason I gave it 4/5 is that it takes two hands to open the trap. If I ever catch a skunk I am going to be in for a stinky experience. It would be nice if this trap had a quick release mechanism that could be operated from a little distance and a long pole of some sort.
I caught five raccoons in six days of having the trap set. Sometimes the raccoon turns the trap over after he is trapped but it doesn't open. The carrying handle and shield came off with the second raccoon. I used a needle-nose pliers to wrap the shield flange around the wires of the trap and now it stays on securely. I also used the pliers to tighten the wires that hold the carrying handle on. Subsonic .22 caliber bullets can humanely eliminate the raccoon without a lot of noise. Marshmallows make good bait. Something fishy will catch raccoons but it can also catch cats and opossums, which I am not trying to reduce.
Using peanut butter and marshmallows in a papercup as bait I have trapped and transported 4 out of a family of 5 raccoon away from my Koi pond.  I take them 8 miles away and release them near a small river.  Only one left is one of the teenagers, I'll probably get them next week.  If I had hired a &#34;critter getter&#34; to trap them, they would have killed them which I didn't want.Easy to set, easy to pick up without exposing yourself to the animal inside.  I like the way it opens, I cover the trap with a towel so they can't see me and just pop the door up.  The minute they see the opening, they are gone.If you are going to transport them remember that it is against the law in some areas.  Also recommend that you put some wood underneath the cage in your car to protect your interior.  Anything they can reach they will try to use to claw their way out.
We bought this ~1 week ago and we've caught 2 groundhogs thus far. We used strawberries for ours. We grated some strawberry on the cage, then tossed one in the back of the cage. We set it next to their burrow, then literally waited 1-2 days each.Some suggestions: Make sure to place the cage so you can check it from afar. We didn't know we caught one for a good portion of the day. Luckily it was a cooler day, so he/she was ok. Also make sure to weight the cage a bit, bc sometimes a moving cage will spook them back out of it. Had no problems with opening the door afterwards, but make sure to open it away from you because they nearly fly out of it!
I put my bait (peanut butter) on the top of the entrance box so it gets between these and the lid. Attracts great and the mice can't get to it so the same bait works for months.No setting required, you don't even really need bait if well placed. I keep these under garage shelving, under stairs, in the floor of the pantry, etc. and just let them sit until successful.There is another model with a clear lid, not needed and these don't have plastic to break. An unadvertised benefit is that these have a "built in alarm" of the catch. The mouse (or mice) will push around on the one way ramp which make a metallic tapping sound to alert you of their presence in the trap.If you want to release live, thats great, but if you want to dispose of the mice, just take the trap and set it in the sun for a bit and the mice will expire fairly quickly.
We purchased this mouse catcher last year when we were suddenly inundated with winter lodgers in the basement.  At first, this trap did a fine job, but then it just petered out on us and stopped working.With items like this it is hard to say where the fault lies, so we are giving it Three Stars.  We had better luck though with the Woodstream Havahart Mouse Trap.Three Stars.  Leaves mice sweaty but ready to live outside again.  For us the trap stopped trapping after a couple of months.
This trap is great.  I've read the reviews and once you get the hang of setting this trap, you realize it is simply awesome.  As mentioned by others:  DO NOT FOLLOW THE BOX INSTRUCTIONS.What you need to do:1- bend the trigger down a little2- use spade shovel in the turf to make slots (2) for the jaws.3- use good sized wood chips to obstruct an active run near the surface--enough so that the trigger rests on the wood when placed.4- check trap daily...you'll be surprised how many moles use the same run.Once I figured this trap out, I've killed 6 in the very first 2 weeks!!!***WARNING:  check the laws in your city/state.  These traps may be prohibited.  One of my neighbors called the animal warden on me and he confiscated 3 of my Victor traps claiming that they are "leghold, steel-jawed traps".  I will be going to court soon...
They are soooo much easier and not near as scary as the old ones.  I don't have to worry about losing my fingers.  I put peanut butter way in the back on the rod instead of where they say to put it, and I catch them every time.I do catch some mice that are small enough to not be harmed, but at least I get them.  And eventually they are not so lucky.  It's so easy to bait and so easy to catch them. Even my kid can do it without harm to her.
This trap can actually catch mice, but if they aren't small, will only injure them.  It also leaves a wiggling tempting snack for other animals to eat, who then take the mouse AND trap to locations unknown. Trap is not selective and will kill or injure anything that trips it. The most selective and humane way to trap is to use a Havahart trap, then euthanize only the problem animals with ether (found as "starting fluid" in automotive stores). Ether is a potent anesthetic which was used on humans in early medical procedures. It's also extremely flammable so take great care.
This is a refill package only and requires you have already purchased the Victor Flea Trap. Our experience with the flea trap has been very good and we have noticed the trap catches anything that happens to stray on its surface.The refills install easily and quickly. We have had to install a new bulb in the trap but that was also easily done. We leave the trap behind a sofa in the den and have noticed a steady decrease in trapped fleas as we've used it.This is a good supplement to flea control and can be safely used with pets.
I purchased these refills at the same time that I purchased the flea trap. There are no fleas in this area who are willing to step on these sticky discs. As a result, the flea trap is of no use to me. These refills are of no use to me as well  and that is why I can give only one star. They cost only $5.76 which is too small an amount to consider returning this item. I plan to offer the flea trap and the refills on the local freecycle website in case there is someone who has a flea problem and wants to try this option.
Not for the faint hearted but a great arm exercise. This thing does pull up lots of dead grasses. Had this for more than 18mths now and it is one of the better tools. But with 5000 sq ft lawn, this is not a long term solution. The metal teeth will bend inwards if you use it forcefully enough; especially when lawn is wet. Not a big deal but can be frustrating each time you try to straighten it back. I'll continue to use this tool for small areas. For whole yard maintenance, I've upgraded to an electrical detatcher. [Greenworks 27022 14-Inch 10 Amp Electric Dethatcher - http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MTQOPVBA281X/ref=cm_cr_ryp_cmt?ie=UTF8&channel=ryp]
I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months, so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning, though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it.
I initially purchased one for use with a rain bird plastic impact rotor sprinkler, I put an 18&#34; extension from the metal ring to the rotor. Works awesome! I have since bought three more and use one of those with another rotor, and the other two for shrub style bubblers/sprayers for my plants in the the mulch beds. One negative which isn't a huge issue for me is that if you leave water sit in it, there will be rusty water. I always disconnect the hose each time and pour out any excess water so it's not an issue, but I can see that if I didn't do that with time it could rust through or clog your sprinkler head possibly.
I am a working Certified Arborist, ISA.  THIS is the best tool out there for pruning, no debate possible.  I use this pruner daily.  Fiskars has the BEST customer support, as well.  Nobody else comes close.  They have sent me replacement parts for everything on this unit, as I needed them.  They have even sent me two brand new units that sit unopened in my work shed, when I simply requested new cutting heads for two units.  They sent me new heads, as well.  They have NEVER charged me one penny for replacement parts or the two, new units. I strongly recommend this tool.  Again, you cannot do better.
The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick, and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result, it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another, which broke due to same issue, but this time was too late to return.  I bought another, more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner
This pruning stick works like a charm. Pull down on the handle or the end ball and voila, cuts through 1+" branches with relative ease.Safety is the name of the game.Thorns and prickles gone.You've got 62" distance between you and some pain. Lower levels on the ladder.This is a must have for anyone having to prune any brush of height or thorns..I have had mine for about 5yrs and it is still in excellent shape.Seems like the cutting mechanism should last a long long time.The pivoting head is very useful as well.
I have a large piece of property in Arizona that requires the removal of bushes from time to time and I figured this looked like the perfect tool to cut the main trunk/branches of a dessert bush; NOT!!!!!It was worth a try, but it is clumsy and will not cut through most of the fibrous shoots of a typical desert bush. I am back to the pick and spade.I have many tools for tree limbs that do a much better job than this.I'll give it to my brother.  :>)Note: My rating is strictly for the said application.
The first one I owned my teenage son tried using it on a limb that was too big and applied too much pressure which caused it to break. As far as I am concerned it was not the companies fault that this unit was abused. I keep it now for spare parts.I am very impressed with the second one I bought. It has paid for it's self many times over and has never given me any problems when it is used properly.I am disabled with arthritis. I do not like heights. This unit is very easy to use and as it stands now I should get many more years of use from mine.
No more getting down on my hands and knees to cut grass that the mower can't reach. I use this to cut grass around my mailbox post, the street lamp post on my property, the big metal box the electric company uses to feed me from its underground cable, the post the cable company uses as my feed point and anywhere else that grass needs cutting which the mower can't handle.These shears are lightweight, are easy to use, cut the grass cleanly and, best of all, they let me stand up while using them. They do not require a battery, power cord, string or anything else besides a hand. Very handy, very useful and very good.
I think I have large hands for a woman but it takes two hands for me to make these pruners work correctly.  I do like the ergonomic aspect and the rolling handle that turns as you squeeze the handles together but it takes two hands for me to do that.8-21-13:  I came back and changed my 5-star rating to a 2-star because yesterday I picked up these shears and walked up the driveway and clipped some Sweet Autumn Clematis to bring that wonderful fragrance into the house.  However, I also clipped and really pinched my right index finger and I was trying to use these pruners with one hand.  They are just too large for me.  I think the swiveling handle is the culprit.  I tried to give them to one of my visiting left-handed brothers and he said no thanks.  They are good and sharp and all but brand new but just too big unless I can use both hands.
This the next best thing to having a full size lopper in the palm of your hand. It's very strong with a power gear mechanism that makes cutting painless.  Because of the power gear action, the trigger handle rotates, softening the blow when the sheers get through the branch.  With traditional sheers, the snapping action can be painful after an hour or two of heavy duty pruning.These are heavy pruners, the grip is very comfortable.  I've only had these for two years, but it's going strong.  I wouldn't recommend it for professional u because of the exposed coil spring which is likely get clogged or damaged under heavy abuse, but it's great for the home owner.This performs the job of countless other cutting implements (small sheers to a medium duty lopper).  It's not a delicate cutter, but until recently, I was using it to deadhead my flowers with good results.
I have been doing yard work for 40 years, so I am no "backyard rookie".  This pruner fell apart the very first time I used it. The "PowerGear" fell off and couldn't be reattached firmly to the pruner. I have used other Fiskar products many times and had normal expectations confirmed.Despite what a few other reviewers might say, everyone has the right to state accurate facts about a faulty product. Poor products deserve bad reviews, both to inform the manufacturer and to warn prospective purchasers about problems encountered. Amazon expects no less.I have processed the return package to send it back to Amazon and will try another unit. That said, I reserve the right to change my opinion should the second unit function properly.
I cut down two very dead shrubs today using these and was very impressed with these lightweight loppers.  I didn't think I'd get the heavier two-inch branches cut because these loppers are so light, but with the right grip the gear holds the wood down and cuts the branch cleanly in half with little effort.  I'm not the strongest person out there and I'm certainly no Hercules, but these loppers made the trim job for me fairly easy.Although these may be harder to use in dense shrub because you need a wide opening for these to work effectively, once you have a grip on the wood the cutting is easy.  And, since they are somewhat long, you can also reach up rather high.  Overall, a very well-engineered set.They are attractive on top of it, and look impressive in my tool corner.
There is power to spare with this lopper. Yes, it has to open very wide to get around the cutting target but if the space permits you to do so the cutting part is almost effortless. This is hands down the best lopper I have ever used as far as ease of cutting. When I finished clipping I decided to apply a bit of oil from the Fiskars Cutting Tool Care Kit that I had purchased. As I was applying the oil I noticed that the black cutting blade had a bright spot. Closer inspection revealed the bright spot was actually a nick in the blade. This was a major letdown after the feeling that resulted from the cutting prowess. I had to delete a star due to the nick and hope that it was just a  rare flaw in the metal. Other than the nick this is a top notch lopper.
This tool makes unpleasant pruning tasks much more pleasant and the ease of cutting makes the work a lot more pleasant!  (If you can bear to think of it that way!)  It really takes the effort out of cutting thick branches.  I carry this lopper along with my smaller pruner--and I don't struggle trying to use the pruner on bush that's too thick for it.  Makes the whole pruning job go faster.I use this on our numerous rose bushes, too.  The length comes in real handy when I'm trying to avoid the thorns.In our neck-of-the-woods, we'll be pruning our roses in mid-February.  So now is not too early to start thinking about Spring-time gardening chores.
These do everything the company says.  I was surprised at how easy larger limbs were to cut compared to my old loppers.  My wife tried these and was really pleased at how easy it was to cut limbs.  (Hint, Hint, guys)  Let me say I would not have tried to cut some of the big limbs with my old loppers (now gone to lopper heaven).  If the jaws of these loppers fit around a limb they will cut it and so can you.  Only once did I have a problem opening them (handles) wide enough to fit a limb inside a shrub, it was a big one.  Most of the time I could find an angle to reach through with and cut inside limbs with no problem.  I would recommend these to anyone who like me enjoys easy work.  At 66 years old and surviveing throat cancer surgery I need that too.
I purchased this at Home Depot.  It can cut 2" or even 2.5" branches with relative ease.  But there is one issue.  The cutting blade broke at some point.  I didn't notice it until I had problems getting the cut to go all the way through.  However, I went to the Fiskars website [...] and found out the live chat button and explained the issue to the customer rep.  She sent a new one out that day and I received it in 3 business days.  Installing the new blade was very easy and it worked just great.Over all, this lopper is a joy to use.  The movement is smooth and the cuts are clean.I wonder if Amazon will ever sell the replacement blade, though.
Fiskars has given me great service over the years, so while I didnt used to have brand loyalty to any particular lawn tool maker, I now buy their products when available.  They're all well made and work well, this is no exception.  The gear drive is smooth and powerful, and as you might expect from a company with its roots in expensive scissors the blades are exceptional and dont need frequent sharpening.  Make sure to spritz a little wd-40 or other light lube on this and any tool with moving parts before using, it'll make them last longer, work better and prevent rust.
I bought these a year ago but hadn't used them much.  I just began using them this spring and loved them - would have given them five stars until today.  Ironically I just ordered another pair yesterday because they are so easy to use - lightweight and sharp.But today the orange clamp that keeps them closed when not in use no longer does its job and they stay open all the time which makes them bulkier to carry as they are much less compact with both blades and handles splaying out.  That's the reason for only 3 stars. After today's malfunction I wouldn't order them again.  Plus the price has gone up in a year from $8.68 to $11.79. They are VERY useful - I just wish they were sturdier.
I've had several of these from various manufacturers. I can't add a lot to the other reviews except to say that(1) they are very capable and surgically precise for pruning. They can handle quite large cross-sections as long as the material is not woody or hard. For example, they're perfect for pruning back conifers to the next junction, even 1/4 in. dia. so long as the material is "softish", and(2) Do not put them away in your pocket or tray or tool shelf without putting the "sheath" on the tip, because these are a very sharp and finely pointed weapon when locked closed. You can get a bad wound when you sit down, or crouch, or bend over if these are in a pocket unprotected.If you lose the little protective tip. use a wine bottle cork. It's greatThat said, they're probably my favorite, or one of my two, favorite pruners. Of many.
These were purchased to replace a larger hand trimmer which I used on my hanging plants, herb garden, seasonal flowers, small shrubs and bushy perennials.These do a very good job on anything that would fall under the category of small and/or delicate because it has a thin and long cutting blade that makes it ideal when you want to trim something without chancing taking out half the foliage. It makes taking off snips of dill easy without damaging the plant or taking off too much.  It is also precise if you are selectively trimming small sections.The handles have a spring action device that requires almost zilch pressure and is comfortable and easy to use even when mounting a morning of garden maintenance. I used it for two hours today and my hands felt fine ----- no stiffness or discomfort.The cost is appealing. Small garden tools can get pricey and since I paid about $8 for these I thought they were reasonable.
Sharp and precise pruning snips are here!  I used these pruning snips for my roses and mums.  I love the spring action handle as this was a great idea.  The tool is light-weight and the quality of Fiskars is one I can rely on.  The size is great and easy to carry with you when you have many plants to prune.  For those family members that like to borrow things and don't bring back, I labeled my snips "Mom" so know one can use them without my permission as I want these back!
I have owned many pairs of this exact trimmer and will continue to do so. I lose them every 3-4 months. I have no idea how or why but i do. So i continue to purchase more. They are tight gripped, the spring is of high quality and will not wear after repeated long use. The shears are sharp and can get into tight spaces (what we need it for). For $11, this is one of the best trimmers you can buy. Enjoy and happy trimming
I'm really weary of buying things that are made in China. Fiskars is located in the USA. I'm unclear on the reason (RICH EXECUTIVES AND GREEDY BOARD OF DIRECTORS) why they would manufacture these snippers in China. Brings me down.Anyway. These are QUITE nice, very lightweight -- you will not be cutting anything more than thin plant material with these BUT they do reach in very nicely, nice thin blades. This operates on a naked steel wire spring, not a coiled spring, so I'm curious how long these are going to last. Comes with a thoughtful little orange plastic cone for the business end of the snippers.These are significantly superior to bonsai-type snippers or repurposed manicure scissors. Ideal for deadheading flowers. I love garden tools and these snippers are a real treat.
I bought these to trim the leaves from my cannabis flowers and they work well for that. For any jobs that require more strength, get yourself something bigger/stronger.They're not perfect, they're not for heavy-duty cutting, and they're made in China.But they cut. I kept a cotton ball and some rubbing alcohol around to clean the trichomes off the blades periodically and had no problem getting through my entire crop. My hands were sore,  but you'll have that after trimming a pound and a half of high quality cannabis.  To help ease the pain, I smoked some cannabis. Worked for me.*I am a fully RCW 69.51a compliant medical cannabis patient*
I always have this tool on me when I'm in the yard.  It's perfect for dead heading dense flowering plant without accidentally snipping the neighboring blooms.  It has a very sharp and strong blade so you can cut only using the very tip of the sheer.  Because the point is so narrow and sharp, it comes with a orange rubber sheath to protect the blade while it's in your pocket.My only gripe with this tool is the flimsy orange clasp which breaks off very easily if you are not careful.  I've owned several copies of these sheers and I've manage to break off the clasp on all three of them by clipping branches a little larger than recommended.  Fortunately, the orange sheath keeps the blades closed, assuming you don't loose it.
I had to go with 4 stars because Amazon stated it was 7-inches long in the description but it's only 6-inches. I checked the Fiskars Website and they show it correctly at approximately 6" in length... but it's exactly that length and the cutting edge is 2". I have a large hand and the length does make a difference for me and I kept pushing the locking lever closed because my hand covers it and my thumb pushes the latch forward. I did trim some lilac bushes with it and it's pretty easy to use, feels the same in either the left or right hand and is quite sharp. However, since I have about 30 more bushes to go I'm going with the larger pairFiskars 9920 Garden Multi-Snip with Sheathand these will fit much better in my wife's much smaller hand. If you have a small hand they you'll likely be going with 5 stars because I can't find any other issue with it.
Never splitting wood before I went into this venture a bit nervous.  But I did end up splitting a 1/4 cord of wood from big logs rather easily.  I heard the trick was speed. However I found just the normal almost over the head with &#34;no extra push&#34; but having good control worked every time.  The bade did exhibit tiny chips, but I kept it sharpened as several recommended.  The price is great and it feels virtually impossible to break. Although I read some had broken the handle. I did over swing once but it did not seem to mark the handle. It did make me concentrate that much harder. I did find stepping back a half of step kept me from compensating as I bent coming forward. I am sure each person swing is a bit different.
If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made, but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear, just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!
After splitting hundreds of cords of firewood, this is the best splitting maul that I've used.  The hollow handle cuts down on the weight and the efficient design of the wedge make splitting wood much easier.  I was able to split 3-foot cedar rounds relatively easily after failing to be able to with my old splitting maul.  I use the 36 inch handle, but sometimes choke up a bit to get more force.  This is an excellent design that allows you to split wood more quickly with less effort.
This is an item I purchased based on reviews.  I barely looked at any other splitting axes.The reviewers were right.I am new to splitting, but watched some videos to learn.  This is a solid axe, yet the lightweight handle gives a great balance and reduces fatigue versus heavier, wood versions.  I have a lot of Fiskars tools so I know their plastic-composite is incredibly strong.  They also have a great warranty.In short, if you use this axe how you are supposed to, you will not have a problem splitting logs.
I wrote reviews on my other Fiskars products and this one is King of them All. I love this axe. With this woodsplitting axe you will not want to own any other splitter. This baby smashes through logs with one medium force swing. The logs explode. I couldn't believe how much wood I split the first day I had this axe. It comes with a great head cover, the axe is light and I think the handle is indestructible. Best money you will ever spend on an axe, especially for wood splitting. No wedges required.
Unfortunately nothing beats gardena. They kepp tight even after years and years of usage. connect as well as disconnect easy.My parents have some that are at least 20 years old and still fine.I am not sure how many attachments are available in the US but in Europe, this is the Rolls Royce of water hoses. You can get sprnklers, waterguns whatever you can imagine....and of course they are REALLY expensive.....well, you get what you pay for.Before I forget, one thing that makes these connectors so great. Once you disconnect the water stops! No dripping and when you connect the &#34;hot&#34; hose...you will not get drenched......If I was unclear pls ask, I will answer if I can
I thought that a plastic quick connect might turn out to be cheesy, but I gave them a try anyway.After only one month at the end of a light duty hose, the male end just snapped in half. The plastic sheared in half at the middle of the fitting with the male end still engaged into the female snap. Yup, it was under normal water pressure but it wasn't like I was using the hose as a tow rope, or pumping benzene through it.I've had both brass and aluminum hose quick connects wear out over the years, but never snap in half like that.Next time I'll listen to that little voice.
The size of this item as described is the very maximum outside dimensions.  Anything you want to put inside it will need to fit the interior of a box about 2 inches less on width, length and height.  Not saying the info is deceptive, just not as clear as it might be!  I have a small air compressor that I thought would fit inside it because it is a bit less than the 21 inch height from the description but the inside of the box is a little under 18&#34;.  I was able to make it work by leaving out the bottom tray and trimming away some of the reinforcing ribs in the lid...which reduces the strength making it unsuitable for sitting on but I didn't plan to sit on it anyway.
I am very happy with this deck box. It is very roomy. I keep all my garden supplies there. It was very easy to install, just 5 min, snap all the parts and it is ready to use. It is sturdy too. We sit on it and it holds me, my husband and my 3 years old with no problems. I actually store there some vegetables and fruits, like potato and apples, when I do not have room in refrigerator and I know that animals won't get it. It nicely blends with my white walls of the house.
The fatal flaw with the design of this hose reel is that it can not support the weight of a 100' hose full of water. The first problem was that the wheel part wanted to separate from the spindle due to the weight of hose.  Finally the part you screw to the wall gave way and broke in half after about a year.  This is a waste of money - anything plastic is essentially junk.  I have now replaced it with a full metal version from another maker that was about three times the price.  It looks like it will work forever.  Also, this reel BARELY is able to hold 100ft of 5/8" hose.  It is probably more suited for 50 or 75ft.  If I had it to do all over again, I would have purchased a quality reel the first time.
This stove top smoker is one of the best products I have ever used (and I use it often).  I have had this thing for about 5 or 6 years now.  It is as good as the day I bought it.  I smoke chicken and ribs mainly but you can smoke just about anything that you could in a regular smoker (just not as much in terms of amount).  It is easy to clean and the wood chips are reasonable in price.  You only use about a teaspoon to a tablespoon depending on what you are smoking.  I would highly recommend this product.  The best wood to use is hickory (it is the all around best for all types of meats).  The next best as far as i have found is the Cherry.  It imparts a nice fruity taste to meat.  If anything happens to this smoker, I will certainly buy another one.  This product is one that lasts and lasts!
I just tried my stovetop smoker and was amazed at the results.  I've used a large outdoor smoker for years, and was skeptical about the stovetop smoker.  I used it to prepare chicken breasts, and they cooked fast and were juicy and tender, and had just the right amount of smoke flavor.  I'm looking forward to using my stovetop smoker for seafood and vegetables.  It's a great way to add flavor to food, and a very healthy way to cook.The smoker is constructed from heavy steel and is well made.  I could smell the smoke as the food cooked, but it wasn't intense and there was no smoke in the house.  I'll still use my outdoor smoker for batch cooking or for smoking large birds, but expect to get a lot of use out of the stovetop smoker.
Used once and really like it. I smoked whole chicken, but I cut chicken in half and smoked about 1.5 hours on lower heat. The chips birned, so next time I would add more chips. I did have to finish chicket (to add some crispiness) in the oven for 10 min. The chicken came out excellent, best chicken I ever cooked. With chicken smoked potato and came out very nice as well with delicate flavor of smoke. Also, I considered as a bonus the aroma of smoked wood that fill out my house, loved it. It was not strong, but flavorful. Highly recommend this product.
I've had this grill for about two months now and I love it. It's nice to see that Char-broil has taken the initiative to break free from the standard black, rectilinear grill. This grill tucks neatly into the corner of my back deck and looks great. Friends are always commenting on it.As for cooking, the smaller grill surface has proven to be ample for parties of four when cooking fish, steaks or skewered items. For sandwich-style grilling (e.g., hamburgers, hotdogs, etc.) you can cook for twice that many. The cooking surface itself is a refreshing change as well; the metal slats are thick and give restaurant-style grill marks to your food, while providing more surface area for smaller items to sit on. The Patio Caddie comes with hickory-scented briquettes that enhance the flavor and mask the gas scent.Be sure to consider the Patio Caddie if you're in the market for a high quality gas grill in this price range. You can't go wrong!
This is a perfect grill for small groups.  I typically only grill for my wife and I so the size is perfect.  It wasn't too difficult to assemble and the parts machining is excellent, everything fit together very well.  I have only 2 problems with this grill.  First, the hangers you attach to the lid to allow you to hang the lid from the side of the grill are quite a pain when placing the lid.  Makes it difficult for the lid to fit snugly.  Not a problem, I'll just take the hangers off as they don't work that well anyway.  Second, I grilled on it 2 days ago, on a fairly calm day weather wise.  For some reason the flame kept going out.  Took me an hour to grill 4 steaks, should have only taken 20 minutes.  Not sure what causes this problem as I haven't ready anyone else experiencing it.  It's annoying enough that it keeps the grill from getting 5 stars.
With the included attractant I caught one yellowjacket.  They preferred to go to the hummingbird feeder and when I took the feeder down they flew away.  Using apple juice I caught some even with the feeder up and more when I took the feeder down.  They live for several days and most of them eventually escaped at night.  Next year I will put this in the refrigerator each night to chill the yellowjackets, kill them while they are torpid, and then put it back up.  Apple juice worked in the fall but something else might be required in the spring.
By far, the most effective pest control for Yellowjackets I've ever come across.  How effective you ask?  We had a major Yellowjacket problem and I went to 4 stores...all of which were out of this trap.  At each store, there was at least 1 person (one place had 3) looking around for the traps because of the yellowjacket problems in this area.  Finally the 5th place I stopped had just restocked and their shelves were full...and yes, there were 2 people already picking them up when I arrived.Come home, put the solution on the cotton ball and by the end of the first 12 hours, we had caught 13 yellowjackets.  I come home tonight from work and we are now up to 25 yellowjackets this device has captured in under 24 hours!Now those are measurable results!EDIT:I just added a photo...over 40 yellow jackets trapped in just 3 days!
Does not seem to actually capture YJ's, but their annoying buzzing stopped when I put one of these about 20' outside of my veggie garden. Somehow it seems to work. YJ's, hornets, were making nests in the GROUND, in dying roots from pine trees which I had cut down YEARS ago...the roots seem to never completely rot, but leave a hollow which apparently invites these guys. And they are protective of their nest area.I use the stuff which comes with the trap, nothing fancy like apple juice and peanut butter.I bought a 2nd one this year for near an apple tree where these guys get their sips from fallen apples or apples which the birds have started to pick on. Hope it works there too.Recommend.
I am guessing the 'attractant' used in these traps is derived from poop.WORD TO THE SQUEAMISH- this bag will be FULL OF FLIES, and the whole thing will be pulsing from the dying wing-beats of the hundreds (thousands?) of flies inside the bag. It is NOT for the faint of heart.YUCK. It's giving me the shivers just to look at the picture.Flies are gross, a clear bag full of horse poop smell and dying/dead flies is worse!Find a different solution.
I'm updating my last review where I said it didn't work. I've since moved it to a new location and this trap collect hundreds of flies. I can really see a difference when I got outside now.I would also like to add that I didn't take this down during hurricane sandy and it held up to the really bad rain, and very high wind pretty well! I thought it was gonna be all ripped apart when I went out there to look at it. The winds reached at least 90MPH. So don't worry if you get a bad storm. As long as you have it tied up good it should stay.
. . .whether they're being attracted for a mile radius.  I didn't think I had a big fly problem.  We had a few flies.  We're in a residential neighborhood in tropical Hawaii, not a horse farm or overly near a public park.  Still, the trap only lasted a week before becoming filled up with what I estimate might be one thousand flies.FWIW, this trap works.  It attracts flies to a smelly liquid trap where they subsequently drown.  During the week I had it up hanging 20 feet from the house in a tree, no flies came into the house.  I'll take a break for a week, then try it again to see if the trap lasts longer and whether the fly population seems to have decreased.FWIW, take two, I developed a macabre fascination with checking on the trap every few hours to see how many more flies had been caught.  Ick.
We had a fly problem a few years ago, so I tried these traps. I was very impressed with the sheer number of flies it caught (my wife was just disgusted). This year we had a bigger infestation, so I tried theRescue Reuseable Fly Trap with Attractant #FTA-SF4and they were nearly ineffective. I purchased a few more of these disposable traps and they're amazing at attracting and catching flies. The smell, however, is quite bad and is almost more offensive than a few rogue flies.The major advantage of this type of trap is that it works in the daytime, when flies are active, unlike an electronic trap like theFlowtron Model BK-40D Electronic Insect Killer (One Acre Coverage)(which I also purchased).The irony, I found, in having such effective attractants is that you get more flies. I moved my traps to the far side of the yard, away from the house, and suddenly we have fewer flies trying to sneak in the side door. (Obvious?)
I can't fathom a fly catching product working any better. We experienced a few flies in the house this Spring so we purchased this product. In less than one week, this product caught over two hundred flies. What is kind of funny is that this product attracts flies to it...who knew there were that many flies around my house. While the product captures many flies, it also attracts them.  Flies that were not necessarily a problem were captured. Day one a few flies are trapped, and each subsequent day--- by the fifth day, the amount of flies caught was unimaginable. I am going to rid the entire neighborhood of flies at this rate. I am going to stockpile this product.
I have a four year German Shepherd and during the summer months the flies tend to munch on the tips of his ears. I have tries all types of all natural insect repellents, none of which ever worked. I also tried flys off which was fair but not 100%, not even 50% effective. So I decided to eliminate the flies to eliminate the problem. I then searched Amazon, my go to company for everything and I discovered the fly trap. I was skeptical at first but I opened the top and filled with water ad directed and hung it near my dogs house. Within hours I saw many flies trapped and within a few days the number of flies in the area has decreased tremendously. I will buy more fly traps and if you have a problem with flys, you should too.
These things work great!  Make sure you follow the directions to open/set it up, then fill it with water and hang someplace out of the way where the flies collect.  I've hung ours about 50 feet from our patio, under a pine tree where we have a quail block feeding the birds.  Lots of flies gather round there, and these traps fill up quickly.  Nary a fly makes it to our patio, even when we have our meals out there.  Before the fly trap, we were constantly swatting and shooing flies while sitting on the patio.  So glad I found these!  Only downfall, they are a little stinky, I can smell it when I walk by about 8 feet away, but since it's not close to our 'living space', it's no problem.
I am an ISA Certified Arborist, so I can tell you, as a professional, that this product beats all other similar products out there, hands down.  I use mine on the job just about everyday, and it stands up to pretty tough use.  It does go through webbing straps every now and then, but restringing new straps is easy, once you get used to it.  Customer Support at Fiskars is second to none.  They have replaced, at no charge, numerous webbing straps, the extension tube and a cutting head.  Rest assured, unless you are a professional out there, you will probably never have to change out anything on your unit.  If you ever have to though, I can assure you that Fiskars will be there to help you out, via their toll-free number and quick e-mail response team.  I recommend this unit and its smaller brother.  Both go into the trees with me, sixty feet and higher, and both give reliable service.
Purchased this item at 11 AM.  Used free supersaver shipping. Received the next day. Unreal.  Apparently these are stocked in local warehouses. I live in a small Ohio city. The tracking number immediately showed a UPS exception. This was a first. The product itself is nice. Well made.  Easy to use.  Some commented on the shipping carton.  It was a long box, with 2 separate box pieces taped together.  The UPS man told me it looked like it may be damaged.  It was fine.  I do agree that there should be a box long enough for the item to fit in.  The pole is solid enough that there was very little chance of damage. The box is so odd shaped that nothing else will be piled on top. This will be a useful product. Added:  Minor dissapointment.  Just saw this in my big box grocery store for $ 69.00-full price. This is a full price store-not a discounter.
This is a nice, light weight tool for trimming small branches high in trees and shrubs.  It easily cuts branches up to 1/2 inch.  The only reason I did not give it a five star rating is my experience with other Fiskars' tools with the same type of adjustable head. The head is a weak point, after a few months of use my experience is that the plastic head will fail.  Even though it has a lifetime warranty; returning for repairs is just too difficult to be worth the trouble.
This was a nice idea, but it doesn't work to well if you have the lid holder.  Whenever I take the lid out of the holder, the tool holder falls off.  I don't really need it, because I have the perfomer which has a built in tool holder on the table, which I forgot about when I ordered this.  The tool holder should have some kind of locking clamps on it so they will stay in place.  I can see how they would interfere with the lid closing all the way if they are hung off the grill itself and imagine that they don't stay in place when the lid is taken off.  I like having the extra set of tool holders so I think I am going to trying clamping them down on the lid holder with pliers.
Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools, I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills, so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now, I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close, or that the tool holder would fall off. Well, it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum, since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use, your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)
This charcoal slow-cooker & smoker does everything as advertised.  It is well made and easy to assemble.  I have done 2 cooks so far (baby back ribs, chicken, sirloin tip & salmon).  As long as you don't keep adding smoke-wood, but only do it at the beginning (and do it sparingly) you will have well cooked and flavorful food.  I recommend trying the "best ribs in the universe" procedure for your first cook - found at [...]  I highly recommend this cooker and think you will do the same.  P.S. - Amazon.com has about the best prices and delivery you will find around.
I used this in Vietnam, where the local butcher, Hang Kau Pung, asked me to use my gas grille for his yak. After butchering it, we used the grille to smoke it and had a problem when the ribs did not fit on the Weber 3601 Rib Rack. I had 5 Weber Rib Racks so they were useless and we had to put the cooked meat on the fly dirty ground near treated sewer water. I suppose if you are using pig Ribs they fit but be weary of larger meat animals.

This thing is ridiculous!  It holds a temperature better than my electric oven.  I can load it up with charcoal, set the vents, and it will be rock steady at 250 degrees for hours.  If you have a favorite BBQ restaraunt that you think is pretty good, try their best menu item and compare it to the "Q" you'll produce on this cooker and you'll never eat out again.  I've made baby back ribs, meatloaf, pork butt, spare ribs, and fatties (smoked sausage rolls) and they've all turned out delicious.  Buy it, you won't regret it.
This is a great product.  It lives up to the Weber name.  The WSM is well built with tight tolerances so heat does not escape.  It is easily possible to get a consistent even burn at 215 degrees for 6 or more hours with a single chimney of charcoal.The two cooking grates allow you to cook a lot of food at a time, and either grate can easily fit several racks of ribs, a 15 pound brisket, or 2 or 3 pork sholders.The water/drip pan holds about a gallon of water and allows for warm moist heat, causing a natural convection and ensuring even heating.It is a breeze to put together and out of the box you will be cooking delicious slow cooked authentic barbeque!

I have been using this rack all summer and still have yet to see it rust as someone mentioned in an earlier review.  The rack is certainly a space saver and comes in handy when you have a lot of grilling do.  I have used it when smoking chicken and ribs in my Weber Kettle, and noticed that the meat may tend to touch when placed in the rack so not all areas may be exposed to the smoke.  If this happens, I may rotate the pieces or just leave it like it is since I'm not entering anything in a competition!  Everything still has the same great taste but the parts that were not exposed to the smoke will have a different color.
I have used this twice now.  Once for baby back ribs (pork loin back) and once for St. Louis style trimmed spare ribs.  It worked great both times, but was easier with the spare ribs than the baby backs.  This was because the spare ribs were straighter (less curve to the rib bones) than the baby backs and stood upright better.  The curve in the baby back ribs made it slightly more difficult to remove a single rack of ribs to rotate it.  But this was a minor issue.  Overall the unit worked great.
You won't find a better way to start your coals for the Webber Smokey Mountain cooker.  Following directions I had half of the coals I needed nice and white hot for my cooker in about 10 minutes.  It is built better than the ones I have seen at Ace Hardware and other places.  There is an inverted cone grill at the bottom that enables the starter to have more surface area for the newspaper sheets that you use to get the thing started.  You will not be sorry you ordered this along with your WSM cooker!
This past summer I tried a charcoal grill for the first time and as a result my gas grill was never taken out of the garage.  It's become an obsession of mine and now I have three different grills, one smoker and a collection of different wood chunks.  My newest obsession never would have taken root if there was not an easy, foolproof way of starting the lump or the briquettes.  I don't have any other chimney to compare this to but it works perfectly every time.  Two sheets of newspaper, dump in your fuel of choice and light it.  10-15 minutes later the coals are ready to go.  If you think the newspaper gives too much ash try paper towels sprayed with some cooking oil instead.  If you grill on a deck be careful when you light it or where you put it after dumping out the coals as it gets very hot.
I haven't used lighter fluid in years, ever since getting one of these.I didn't believe that just a couple sheets of newspaper would be enough to get the charcoal going, but that's really all you need.  I use natural charcoal exclusively (you know, real wood, not gravel and clay briquettes), and this works perfectly with that kind of charcoal.You'll reduce the amount of time necessary to get a usable fire, and you won't have that annoying starter fluid smell or taste on your food.Two caveats to consider: this thing gets very hot by its nature, so use oven mitts when grabbing the handle, and be careful where you put it after dumping the coals, so as to keep small children and yourself from touching it until it cools.
I finally gave up on the lighter fluid and bought this last summer.  What a brilliant idea!  I have always used lighter fluid and was notorious for using to much because the charcoal wouldn't light fast enough.  That problem is solved with this chimney starter.  The coals ignite quickly and a full blaze is going within minutes!  Once the flames have died down, just dump them out and start grilling!I have the Performer grill but when I bought the grill, the store didn't have any cartridges so I have been using the chimney starter all summer.  So it's a nice backup if you have the Performer but no gas cartridge.This is a good product for the price.
I have another no-name chimney starter that I bought a few years ago for around $15.  I've used it for cooking dutch oven for a couple of years and it has worked fine, or so I thought.  I recently purchased aWeber 2820 Smokey Mountain Cooker/Smokerand bought this Weber Chimney Starter at the same time.  It is MUCH bigger than the generic starter I've been using, and the additional lift assist handle is great.  The conical grate inside the starter allows the charcoal to get up to temperature much quicker than my old unit.  I don't know what I'll use my old starter for now.  From now on, it's only Weber for me.
As an avid griller and lover of cooking on charcoal, I can't say enough good things about the Weber Chimney starter.This simple to use chimney style starter quickly lights enough lump or briquette charcoal to fill your 22 1/2 inch weber grill WITHOUT LIGHTER FLUID!!Lighting is easy. Simply add charcoal to rim of chimney, place parafin lighters or newspaper in the bottom. Light newspaper or parrafin lighters and place on charcoal grate in grill.  In 20-30 minutes you will have orange hot smokin' charcoal.This is also a must for cooking things with very long cooking times such as turkeys or roasts.  About 30 minutes before adding additional charcoal, use this puppy to light your coals, and then add to the fire as needed.As I mentioned earlier, I reccomend using this in conjunction with the Weber parrafin charcoal lighters.  On windy days they are easier to use than newspaper.Once you use this you will never go back to using lighter fluid again.  A must have for anyone who owns a charcoal grill.
this kettle rotisserie works GREAT. it's a much better design than what's shown in the ad. what I mean by that is the one in the ad shows metal tabs that rest on the grill, with the new design they got rid of the tabs and flared out the bottom of the ring so the whole ring sits on the grill giving it a nice tight seal. it makes controlling the heat much easier than the previous one. WELL DONE WEBER now as far as the motor it's super quiet and works very well. the spit is one piece steel much better than the two piece rods the ring itself is the same quality as the weber kettle grill. I really didn't want to spend that kind of money on it but after receiving and using it I'm glad I did. this unit is well made and expect to get many years of great grilling out of it.
Super fast shipping. Great addition to my Weber 221/2" Performer barbecue! What's confusing is that I called Weber's customer service and they told me that the rotisserie would not fit the Performer barbecue. OK then I e-mailed there tech staff, e-mail sent back also saying that the rotisserie would not fit the performer!(Neither correspondence could tell me why it wouldn't fit). I read the reviews on Amazon and there were two which said that the rotisserie fit and worked fine on their performers. So I purchased one and they are correct it fits and work's great.Thanks guys!! I will be calling Weber again today to dispute their claims!
After brining my 13 lb turkey overnight, I started up the coals and set the turkey spinning. A little over 2 hours later, I took it off the grill and let the bird rest on the countertop. The smell drew every teenager in the house to the kitchen. The bird was completely picked over before I was able to make the rest of meal. So much for the other food groups. It was completely devoured. There was literally nothing left. My wife, daughters, and their friends kept repeating, &quot;That was the best turkey I ever had. You deserve a trophy!&quot; We now have their friends calling wanting to know when I'm going to roast another bird.Folks, this is a must-get addition to this grill. Forget about the chicken with the beer can up the old caboose. I am not the most experienced grill master in the world but this thing made me into a neighborhood hero.I'm off to Safeway for another Butterball. I wonder where I'm going to put my next trophy?
This rotisserie cooks great.  It adds another dimension to cooking on the Weber grill.  Like some mentioned in the other reviews, the rotisserie does not have a real tight fit with the lower half of the Weber grill.  I don't understand why Weber just did not make the bottom lip of the rotisserie the same as that of the grill cover.  Then it would have been a perfect fit.But regardless, the rotisserie works and cooks great.  I expect many years of rotisserie cooking with this piece of equipment on my grill.
This is a very sturdy little item for yard work, but it is very low to the ground to be handy to sit on if you have any back problems or you carry any extra weight.  Would be nice if it was a few inches taller.  The storage compartment under the seat is kinda inaccessible, and it would be nice if the seat popped up so you could get to what you store in there.  Would also be nice to have a "tongue" so that you could pull it along.
This is my second cart.  The old one is still serviceable in the garden after years of HOT and freezing weather.  I use this new one in the house to scoot around cleaning floor boards or anything hard to reach.  Saves my back. I haven't found it has a weight limit.  I have used it to scoot some pretty heavy stuff from place to place.  Unlike the description the top does not open although some of the photos on the box are a different model which does seem to have a hinged side.  No matter I just reach under.  It would be even better with a couple drainage holes. It can sometimes be difficult to roll on rough ground but given its light weight I just move it and sit back down. Highly recommend if bending is hard on your back.
We actually have two garden carts this one and another that is all metal. The metal one even has a seat like those you see on an antique tractor. The metal one looks to be the better one HOWEVER my wife prefers the Garden Hopper over it. It feels sturdier than the metal one and does not tip as easily. I have noticed that the metal one now needs repainted and some bolts replaced. Not so with the Garden Hopper. It has sat out in the sun for days and it's paint has not faded. We do store it inside during the winter but we do that for the metal one too.My complaint is about the hinged lid. It takes too much force to open it. I realize that this is necessary because you don't want the lid coming open when you pick it up to carry it. Honestly it's just a minor complaint to me and does not detract in any way from the quality of this cart.All in all we are both happy with this cart.
I bought this last week direct from the company so that I could take advantage of a bundle deal. Wishing now that I had purchased from Amazon so that I could return this easily.I would imagine that this item would be great if you are using it for grass maybe or in an area that is bricked or concreted. In my case, in the woods with dry leaves on a gravel driveway and wind all the time it is a recipe for disaster. The flame is not very focused and unless you absolutely fry the weeds, they don't die. Even the young ones. I ended up pulling the weeds the next day around the house, but I guess I need to find another solution for my 800 ft. gravel driveway.In negotiation right now trying to return the torch. I'll post later about customer service.
I've used the "vaporizer" twice and love it!  I have a gravel driveway - what a pain to use Roundup to kill the little grasses and weeds sprouting in the spring; it doesn't take much to fry them plus, on a cold day, the gravel gets warmed by the torch so my feet stay toasty.  I was initially concerned about lugging around the big propane tank on my dolly - not a hassle at all, the torch extends about 10 feet out so a big area can be covered.  Just be careful with dry grass - it catches on fire easily so keep an eye out for persistent flames.  Otherwise, a big time-saver - I wish I had some snow or ice to melt.
Buying this product was some of the best money I ever spent. So much fun I am surprised the government has not made them illegal. I love this product. It doesn't stop weeds from growing back, but you'll actually want the weeds to return so you can burn them again. I am 6'2" and I wish the handle was 8 inches longer, but still love this product. The hose could be another 2 feet longer, but again, you want to own one of these weeddragons. The first day I had this item I used it for four hours non-stop. I did not want to go inside when it got dark. Get one of these and buy yourself two or three propane bottles. One bottle of propane will last a long time with this baby, but you'll want fresh gas once you discover all the things you can burn with this baby.
This is well made and sturdy but I just don't find myself using it because it's so heavy to carry to the garden - especially if you're carrying tools as well.  Instead I usually end up taking along a light plastic low one-step stool from the dollar store.  It's true I do struggle getting up at times without those nice handles to push against but I don't have to lug the heavy thing around and for me that's more of a chore. It just doesn't feel comfortable either - the seat is too high and the kneeler too low and neither is very soft.
I have owned this bench/kneeler for some years and would not part with it.  It is lightweight but amazingly strong.  It is a ready made seat for me in the garage, and it doesn't take up much space.  I am (unfortunately) 175 pounds, and this bench supports me easily.  Because of arthritis, the kneeler option is a must for me out in the garden not just because of my knees but because the bench's legs will help me stand up.  This is money well spent for anyone you know who is a serious gardener.
I really like this bird feeder but not for the fact that squirrels can't get into it. I have two dogs that make sure that doesn't happen. Heck half the time they don't even let the birds on it. But I love it because I went out the other day and four of my six bird feeders looked fine and had seed in them but when I inspected them the seed mix had gotten wet and clumped up so it no longer would come out of the feeder. Not this feeder! The water can't get in to the seed area because the squirrel begone hood. This was the only feeder that was completely empty even though it was the newest edition and held the most seed. It's a hit with me, the birds, and maybe even the dogs!
I probably would of given this a better score if the design of where the two little prongs are, was different. They support all the weight of this big bird feeder, and its heavy when filled...its good its a big one, filling less often interests me. BUT...the large plastic tube has two little holes drilled in it to have a little piece of metal stick into each hole to hold this, and I am thinking in time, just from the elements and the sun/heat that with taking this apart to fill, refill, etc the plastic will fatigue...then you have a very expensive bird feeder that the squirrels can't even TRY to get into anymore.To me the design of it and how it will probably not last too long is important as this is a pricy feeder. On the upside, it was easy to assemble. I was interested as to where it was made, it says its made in the USA of US and CHINA parts. Draw your own conclusions.
Between the weight controlled port closure and the tilting and wobbling dome, this bird feeder certainly lives up to its claim of being squirrel proof, BUT it lets so much birdseed fall out of the bottom as the base tilts under the weight of even the tiniest bird that squirrels and large birds can gather up as much birdseed they wish.Probably not quite the solution to the problem you were looking for.Note: The bird feeder comes mostly assembled, and I made no attempt to check the already assembled parts.  After a month one of the perches somehow unscrewed itself and fell off.  I recovered the perch and the nut but could not find the locking washer.  If the locking washer was never there, that would readily explain how the perch came off, and when I checked the other three they were still tight.  So it might be worth a couple of minutes of your time checking that all four perches are screwed in tight when you first unpack it.
When I received this product, the bolt to tighten the baffler was not the correct size so I called the manufacturer. They were quick to respond and sent me a second whole bird feeder. The issue with the second one is that it was missing all of the hardware. Since I received this as part of the Vine program, I was not going to waste any more of my time trying to get this manufacturer to ship out the correct parts.We gerryrigged the baffler, but it makes removing it to put more seed in very laborious. So far after 2 weeks no birds. It does take awhile to get birds to a new feeder.Why the one star? Too expensive and the manufacturer has obvious problems with packaging. Not worth the time and money. Buy something for less money. A hint on keeping squirrels away from feeders is to remove any from areas where squirrels can jump to. We have six feeders and no squirrels. Now deer are another thing altogether!
The assembly is easy and the design is good but not perfect as it does not stop small chipmunks getting at it. But this feeder prevents squirrels from feeding on the seeds. I have used this over the past one month and we have few chipmunks in the yard to cause enough trouble at the feeder. When a squirrel jumps at the feeder, the metal dome tilts and wobbles to throw the critter off balance. The weight-activated base also tilts to close off the four feeding ports. The feeder is designed satisfactorily and the metal dome and feeding base is well constructed. The glossy heavy-duty powder coated finish protects the feeder from sun and rain. I have rated three stars for its quality and overall performance.1.Perky-Pet 336 Squirrel-Be-Gone Wild Bird Feeder
I own several Perky-Pet brand items and have always loved their products.  I really love EVERYTHING about this squirrel-proof, EXTRA LARGE bird feeder; except for the price.I have 5 other feeders in my fenced-in yard and the birds in my yard flocked to the feeder on the very first day I hung it up.  No clogging, no squirrels, great design and super easy filling are the main things I really like about this feeder. If you don't mind the price, I would urge you to purchase this feeder.  It is undoubtedly my favorite feeder in my yard!Happy Feeding!
This is a nicely made feeder, easy to assemble, fill with seed and hang.  I have had it up for about a week and so far no squirrells have  been able to get to the  food!  I have it hanging from a shepards hook  that  is cemented into the ground! The birds have had no issues that prevented or made it difficult for them to eat at the feeder.While it is nicely made, easy to assemble etc. it is in no way worth $72!!!  I can't imagine anyone paying that kind of money for a bird feeder that is suppose to keep squirrels out of it.
I let the feeder hang for about a week under 4 different trees.I would purposely put some bird feed on the ground in hopes that they would eat it and then move up to use the feeder.For some reason I never could entice them to try it.Even squirrels climbing neighboring trees and the tree it was hanging from ignored it.The design seems to make sense but I think the main problem is the way the little metal perches are sticking out instead of being in front of the seed dispensor like a more traditional feeder.Maybe when the ground is covered in snow it would draw birds to it.Or maybe in the spring when birds are busy making a nest they would try the easy supply of food.But here in the late summer/early fall they just avoided trying it.
All of the reviews criticizing the design are correct. The link between the bottle and the suction cup assembly is fatally flawed. On the feeder I received, the glass blob and the runners on the suction cup frame fit together so tightly that there's no way to get the feeder off the frame when it's stuck to a window. Once it's on the window you have to wrestle the entire assembly off to refill, and then go through the tortuous process of remounting the suction cups. Good news/bad news - the feeder is so cheap that it's not worth paying the postage to send it back. Despite the much higher cost, I think the only maker of hummingbird feeders worth buying is Aspects.
I wanted a glass hummingbird feeder and decided to try this one on my window before springing for some of the more glamorous-looking blown glass ones. I mounted it on my kitchen window, under an awning on the northeast side of the house, not at all expecting anything to happen. A ruby-throated hummingbird found it the very first day!It took some force at first to separate the mounting bracket thing from the feeder itself. In fact, I had to drop it first for it to break loose and detach! Fortunately, nothing broke. I probably could have just soaked it in some hot soapy water and it would have come apart easily.You can't beat glass. I'm just totally getting away from plastic these days....
I too had trouble at first and gave this feeder a bad review but after fully reading the directions the brackett with suction cups separates from the bottle . I suggest you clean the window fully , which I did and it has never come down , been up for at least a month. When you refill hold the brackett in place with one hand and slide the bottle up and off with the other. It also does not leak. Since the brackett separates from the bottle it is very easy to apply suction cups to window. Forget all that about rubbing the suction cups with friction to make it stick.
This set of three, multi-colored bottle brushes is perfect for cleaning hummingbird feeder ports and other small holes and places.  For example, I have reserved one to clean out the small spouts in my fountain which tend to clog with algae as the summer wears on.  Each brush is about 3.5 inches long, with a tapered head that begins at 1/8 inch and widens at the base to 1/4 inch.  The brushes can crush down to a much more narrow diameter than that, of course -- the width of the wires that hold the brushes, less than 1/16 of an inch.  The plastic handles are rigid, although they can accidentally be snapped in two with pressure.  The wired support of the brushes themselves is only slightly flexible; you won't be able to work these brushes around corners and inside the base of a feeder bottle.These are basically short, rigid, reusable pipe cleaners.  They are perfect for cleaning hummingbird feeder ports or any other job requiring those qualities.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
This little light is easy to assemble, needing not much more than a screw driver to tighten the nut and screw. Once it is clamped down on another sturdy object, it stays put.  It doesn't wobble or come undone.  The cord is five feet long.  Depending on how far away this lamp is from the plant, the effective radius is plenty enough (about 24" from a foot away).  I use this over a germination set next to my bird cage, and my little dove gets some of that light as well.One thing about this that may be dangerous to other users:  the black hood that goes around the socket gets VERY HOT!  This lamp would not be recommended around birds or small children.  However, set in a nice location this is a pretty lamp that provides good swivvel and warmth.This clamp comes with a 60-watt bulb, packed in its separate cardboard support.
There is no reason for the manufacturer to put red food coloring into this mix. There are numerous concerns about the effect on hummingbirds.  This is reason enough to not buy this product.  Buy a product without the dye.Better yet, just buy sugar.  Use 4 parts water and 1 part sugar.  Boil the water first and then add the sugar until dissolved.  You will save money and perhaps a hummingbird's life doing this versus buying dye tainted food.  Hummingbird food is only sugar with coloring.CAUTION.  DO NOT use artificial sweeteners or honey, use only sugar.  Honey and sugar substitutes will malnourish and quickly kill hummingbirds.  Sugar Only!
I love Perky-Pet feeders, but they should be ashamed of themselves for selling this. They do not need artificial anything, especially food coloring! All you need to do is bring 4 parts water to a boil, and 1 part white sugar, let boil a couple of minutes and let it cool. If you are too lazy to do this, you shouldn't be feeding hummers. It only takes a few minutes, and you can make more and store it in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. Hummingbirds also get their nutrition from real flower nectar, and small insects.
Here's some opinions I have after using this blower for a couple of weeks now.1. The vacuum bag is hard to take off. I seen in another comment that, do not to slip in in all the way. Haven't tried that yet2. The On/Off knob. Sometimes I found I bumped into it with my hand causing it to move it's position.3. I found it easier to let the bag lay on the ground instead of using the strap around the shoulder when vacuuming leaves.4. The Magnesium Impeller will fit on this unit. I ordered and installed the Magnesium Impeller from Toro model 51598. (thanks to Allen who commented about that in his review)5. Would be nice if it had one more lower setting on the blower6. It's very light and has plenty of power
Received this Toro for Father's Day and I love it. Sweeping and raking are two of my least favorite yard chores, and this unit has instantly become one of my indispensible tools. Although I was able to vacuum up green hedge trimmings w/o any real problem, I went ahead and ordered the replacement impeller from the heavy duty Ultra model (they are interchangeable), for an additional $30. I was going to mount it right away, but now have decided to run the plastic one until it breaks or wears, then switch to the magnesium one. It makes sense to do this, as the magnesium impeller is very light, yet this Super unit is 4 lbs less than the Ultra, which helps at the end of the day.
This Black and Decker has worked well in my father's tiny 25' x 80' yard, but I wouldn't want to use it for a larger area. Here are my observations:Pro -+ Easy to Use; just plug it in and go+ Quiet; can use it anytime day or night without disturbing the neighbors+ Lightweight; my elderly father had no trouble using this when he wanted to, but my son also was able to help outCons -- No Cord Included; you need to provide your own heavy duty extension cord- Watch the Cord While Cutting; like using a vacuum cleaner, you need to be mindful of the cord so you don't accidentally run it over (I recommended the bright orange color ones that are easy to see against the green grass)Overall, we are very happy with this for use on a small yard.Highly Recommended!CFH
After using a heavy metal mower for years, this was a blast of fresh, light air. You can mow one-handed and wrangle the cord with your other hand....HOWEVER, we have officially just broken 2 of them. The first one was killed when the blade hit the protruding metal sewage pipe in our yard. The second one just broke now when I set the blade too low and hit an old tree root under grass. The blade got bend, and may be replaceable if the main stem is also bent. I also hit a rock a few weeks ago and almost broke it then, too...Best for even yards without anything that can bend the blade. The cord is a total pain to wrangle and keep from going into the blade...May consider a rechargeable battery model next....
I feel like I am vacuuming my lawn instead of cutting it, and the cord gets quite annoying to constantly move out of the way.  But as far as quality, cost (no gas) and quick startup, it's very good.  I would recommend if you can get past the cord getting in the way all the time....it definitely took me probably twice as long to cut the grass than it normally would with a gas mower just because of having to move the cord over and over again.  But it cut well, was very quiet.
I bought this product back in 2004, replacing an older gas mower after my neighors house caught fire from a leaking gas can in his garage. Used the electric mower until 2007, when I treated myself to a mow/blow/go gardner. I just stuck the machine out in the side yard and never touched it. In July 2008, I pulled it out to mow a newly planted lawn not covered by my mow/go guy. Plugged it in, and it started right away, try that with a gas mower. My new house has 2300 sf of front and back lawn, this mower just gobbles up that lawn. It does bog down in taller/thicker patches, hence only 4 stars. But it gives a nice clean cut. Changing the blade was easy. And it does a nice job of mulching, my lawns look great. I will never own a gas mower!
I originally chose a more expensive knee pad, ignoring these because of the single strap. However, when the ones  I ordered didn't work right, I came back to these. The other Fiskars products I have purchased have been very nice.When I first put them on I fastened the strap across the crease behind my knee and it cut into me. Immediate pain. However, I found it easy to adjust the strap below my knee (which actually pulls the cup into place better) and even crawling around, the straps stayed away from that painful spot.I will be using these for both gardening and crawling on cement under our home to replace the filter on the heater, so I am extra pleased with the waterproof nature of them.  They fit me nicely, and once I adjusted the strap, very comfortably. The cup shape keeps them from slipping to the side.
This is not what you want for heavy duty wear, like dragging your knees around on concrete all day.  These are light-weight and comfortable in that binding area behind the knee:  Perfect for kneeling to do work in your garden.  As a gardener, with several veggie gardens and plenty of shrubs and rose bushes spread over an acre and a half, these knee pads are perfect.  Both my husband and I have a pair.  They have a lifetime warranty, too!  I couldn't ask for more.I love Fiskars and when I have a choice, I always choose Fiskars:  This brand very seldom disappoints.
I bought these for two reasons: 1 - I paint a lot (walls).  2 - I have little nieces and nephews who like to ride on my back as I crawl on the floor!  For the former, they work great-  they don't add any weight to me as I walk around and go up and down ladders, etc.  I can get on the floor and paint near the baseboard while on my knees.  It's great.  My knees aren't the best and these help a lot!  For the latter reason, they're great too!  I can quickly get these on and then let one or two (or three!) of my plentiful and beligerent nieces and nephews ride on my back around the house!  Good excercise and quite tiring!  But for the price - you can't go wrong.
I made the huge mistake of buying a cheap $2 trowel from my local HD, of course, it literally snapped at the handle while doing some light digging.The Fiskars trowel on the other hand, is built to last. I couldn't really tell from the pictures, but once I inspected and held it, I could feel the quality and after testing it, I noticed a huge difference, the way it handles dirt/soil and the little work it takes to dig, is simply great.What I like the most is the design, the handle is a  solid metal piece, thick and extremely durable. It didn't bend while digging and it felt very comfortable. The handle is wrapped in a rubberized sleeve which happens to be very ergonomic.Nothing much to say really. This is great gardening tool that I'm sure will last.
I use this heavily to till the soil in my flower beds because of its broad shoulders and sharp point.  Although its used mostly for troweling, it's  narrow enough to be used for planting and broad enough for transplanting.  I have a tool for every job but I find this is the only digging tool I really need to bring along.  If you're debating which type of  hand digger to get (planter, transplanter, troweler, etc.), I would stick with this trowelerThe handle is very comfortable, important when jabbing it into the ground repeatedly to loosen the soil.  The wooden tools I've used in the past have been very hard on my hands but, I come away with no pain with this design.The polished alumnium is VERY strong, light weight, mostly scratch resistant and does not rust.  The textured material on the handle does collect dirt and has to be scrubbed to get clean.
I've used this for around a year now, absolutely love it.  I keep getting more gardening tools and haven't ran out of pockets yet.  The pockets are all different sizes, some very narrow for something like a pair of scissors or a marker, there is a big one that fits my PH tester perfectly.  I also have theCustom LeatherCraft 1140 EasySeat Lightweight Plastic Bucket Seat for 3 1/2- 5 Gallon Bucketswhich turns the bucket into a chair and seals the interior if you want a dry spider-free place for gardening gloves.
Do you find yourself constantly looking for the last hand tool you used when working in the flowerbeds? Are you forever walking back and forth to get the right tool, or to toss the weeds you just dug up in a lawn bag? If so, you need a garden caddy, and you could do a lot worse than this model. While it's not made of heavy-duty canvas like the $60 models, it's strong enough for every day use, and it can last through several buckets. I bought this one for my girlfriend, a passionate gardner, and she's very pleased with it. Might even get one for myself.
Using these in Japan. I have used them previously in Canada. They were sent to me by family since I wouldn't have purchased them again. In my case at least, Octenol seemed to reduce the kill rate...at least the number of zaps I hear throughout the day and night. It was the same back in Canada, at least the kill rate wasn't any better with the cartridges. The other down side to these (if they do have any effect) is that it's highly dependent on the direction and force of the wind. If the mosquitos' hiding/breeding area is downwind of these then great...if not, then what? Given the massive and ongoing cost of these...I would just hang another zapper. I'd be willing to bet that would be MUCH more effective.
My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules, citrus sprays, commercial pest repellants, or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running, the cat came by, got blasted with it twice from about 15' away, and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard, but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!
I would have given this five stars but the connections loosen with use and I have had to hand tighten the connection right beneath the scarecrow head a couple of times.  I use the two scarecrows to scare critters from our newly created garden pond.  I bought the two scarecrows along with Yard Sentinel's RC Ultrasonic Pest Controller.  They work in unison and are effective!  I have the Yard Sentinel set to only operate after dark for raccoons and any other four-legged critter.  Everything has remained undisturbed.  And, I did not put on the yellow stickers so they are solid black and (to me) less obtrusive.  This was a great investment.
It sprays water but the cats just walk beyond the area that gets sprayed. They don't seem to care.They (I have two) have a tendency to break. The settings dial never worked properly, and even when turned off for four weeks somehow ate the battery.Animals must be large, probably raccoon or bigger. Definitely doesn't go off for birds or squirrels (though butterflies immediately in front of the sensor sometimes did.) For me it is a source of aggravation and would probably serve me better used as a projectile.
This product not only works well, but it's also fun to watch!!, especially when rabbits, cats, or dogs come to do their business in your loan or rabbits eating your grass, this thing blast them with a burst of water before they can escape!! I love watching this in the early moring hours. Also when a dog or cat wants to take a poop in your yard and the owner of the pet just lets them do it with cleaning up behind them, this thing will blast the animal with water and they will run away from you property. Have fun watching!!
I was skeptical that this scarecrow would deter the deer in my yard.  I'm very glad that it exceeds expectations!  I placed it facing the parts of the yard where the deer trails end.  Heard it go off during the night a few times during the first week, followed by the sound of snorting and stamping deer.  For the first time in years my yard is not a deer buffet--as a matter of fact NOTHING in my yard has been browsed this year.  So glad to finally see some perennials that I haven't seen in five years.  I have tried all kinds of things in the past to deter them and nothing works.  If you have deer problems I highly recommend giving this a try.  If only there was something for winter (besides deer netting).
Everytime I forgot and walked out onto the the lawn, I got sprayed pretty good.  That's the problem with this unit. You either have to leave it on all the time and get soaked or remember to turn it on every night before you go in..........or buy an outdoor  timer and hook it up to the hose, which I ended up doing.  The Deer ate 25 flats of impatients I planted last year....... along with 15 Hostas, Daylilies, Verbina, Phlox and anything else they decided to munch on.  Bought these toward the end of the season so I'm not sure if they did any good to deter the deer...........they pretty much ate everything before I  got it.  We'll see next year  ( 2013 growing season) and report back.
My daughter gave me the scarecrow years ago and it sat in my garage until a few weeks ago. I am currently replacing her rear yard fence and her idiot neighbor has a dog that started coming into her yard and relieving himself on her grass. Needless to say this women is a real jerk who takes no responsibility for her kids or pets. I remembered having the scarecrow and immediately put it in her rear yard. It has worked flawlessly keeping the little monsters, both canine and human on their own property. Her other neighbors asked me about the motion activated sprinkler, they are also having problems with the kids and dog and are now getting their own.
I needed a hedge trimmer that was light and easy to work with to trim grass around my deck and rock garden.  I have used this trimmer for summers and it does exactly what I need at a very reasonable price.My requirements:1. Light in weight2. Easy to operate3. Strong enough to cut grass but not strong enough to fling rocks or damage pots with flowers which edge the grass4. InexpensiveThis trimmer met all  my requirement perfectly.  I am able to trim the grass in a matter of minutes, it works well in small places, and it gets all the grass in one pass.  After two summers I am still using the original string, and did not need to replace it so far.Note: this trimmer requires an outdoor-rated electric extension cord which is not included with the trimmer.Ali Julia review
This product was lightweight and easy to use. Even a person with back problems will be able to use this product with ease and minimal strain to back. It was easy to assemble and I had no problems with using this trimmer.This product was good for trimming; however, it did not work well for cutting thicker grass and weeds. I found it fairly easy to change the spool wire on this product.  I recommend buying the trimmer bundle that comes with extra wire and spool.Over all, this was a good product and served its purpose and the price was right. My husband loved it.
I hate to think of myself as having fun at some other creature's expense but - BWAHAHAHA, bite THIS, you bloodsucking fiends!!I first saw this being used on a vacation to St. John.  The employees in the cantina each had one, and were waving them around slowly in front of their faces, almost in a hypnotic way.  Apparently that is the best way to get mosquitoes, according to these folks (who should be VERY familiar with mosquitoes and their ways!)  If you try to swat at them too fast you will just blow them away, but if you move the paddle around slowly they will just fly right into it and go sizzle sizzle sizzle ...!  ;^)Heed what everyone says though: don't hit yourself with it while the buttons are pressed, and don't let kids "play" with it.  It can give you a nasty burn.
I don't own these but saw them at a flea market. No question in my mind why they were up for sale (but should have gone in the trash IMO!) My friend discovered -- the hard way! -- that these deliver a VERY unpleasant shock if touched to human skin! Mind you, this friend is a large manly guy, not easily affected, yet he howled and dropped it! So you can imagine the jolt of voltage that must have been involved here! I would not want my children in the same room with these devices, nor my father with his pacemaker, or even my pets to inadvertantly come in contact with the live zapper screen. What were they thinking!?!?!?
Really, this is a very effective means of pest control. The safety feature of having two buttons pressed in order to activate it, and having them displaces so you dont accidentally turn it on is nice. When you strike, you get a big blue jolt, which from my experience, makes it fun for the kiddos. Also, i touched the racket while it was on....the current is definitely pretty strong. It wont kill a person, but it does hurt, which is a strong indication of its effectiveness against the much, much smaller insects. They dont always die first zap, but it always stuns them at the least, allowing you to toss them outside or dispose of them however you see fit.A good way to spend $10 IMO.
This is the cheapest made product I've ever owned.  To insert the 2 batteries, there is no flap that you open.  You have to take the whole handle apart with a screwdriver, then the circuit board falls out and the 2 switches fall out to the floor.  Insert the batteries, put circuit board and switches back in, insert each tiny tiny screw and the nut (3 each), hoping the screw doesn't fall out while you're holding the nut.  Are you kidding?  I'm returning this, because I don't want to go through this each time i need to change the batteries.  I just bought another one that uses 2 D size batteries, you just insert the batteries into the flip open compartment in the handle.
This compost starter really speeds things up. I use a tumbler as well as a compost pile which is reserved for leaves, branches and the like. Although the package says you will get humus in 60 to 90 days, I am already seeing progress.  Despite a cold snap, the compost is progressing.This product was sent with the box contained in a plastic bag.  There was some leakage although no obvious rips or tears.Nothing works like progress and this product does speed the composting process. Recommended.
I use a tumbler that I rotate every few days.  I sprinkled a cup of this into the compost that was already in there, with some fresh vegetable skins dropped into it, and within a few days there was a noticeable increase in the matter, with a black, rich compost all around.Now mind you, I live in southern Arizona and we already get the hot, dry heat this time of year.  I don't plant my summer garden until the monsoons hit in July. By then this compost will be ready.  I can actually use what is in the tumbler now for my growing tomatoes.  I keep the compost damp and turn the tumbler regularly.  The outside heat helps keep the matter hot.One thing I noticed when I first used this on my compost is that the bugs that were already in the tumbler scrambled.  Apparently even beetles and roaches give way to this stuff.  And that is a good sign.
I bought a rotating composter last summer. It took all summer to turn my yard waste into compost. Actually, by the end of the last summer, while the compost was almost done, it was too late in the season for me to use so I just left it in the composter. This spring I had great compost. That's almost a year for that batch. This year I am hoping to speed things up a little.This product contains the microorganisms to get things started quickly. I added this product to my yard waste a few weeks ago. I have already noticed an improvement on the progress of the compost process compared to last year. Hopefully I will have usable compost ready to spread in the garden by the end of summer.
It can be quite hard to get a compost pile going. We have tried a couple different ways and couldn't really get what you are suppose to get from a compost pile, we would always end up with just garbage and flies. We researched online and watched a lot of videos. It has to have a certain mixture of types of things that you add. We had way too much household food in ours. We also decided to forgo our compost bin and decided to go with a tumbler composter after a couple failed attempts in our bin.This Ringer Compost Plus helps get your compost going. We are now having much better luck. I suggest doing some research yourself if you are just beginning. There is more to composting than just throwing your scraps and coffee grounds into a bin.Spring is the perfect time to start and the Compost Plus gives it a head start.
I setup bins and a tumbler to compost this year.  Our city recently changed the trash system and I'm growing a vegetable garden so it just made sense to compost much of what would otherwise be thrown out.I've started using this in my compost bins along with kitchen scraps, brown and green matter.  It seems to be speeding up the process, but it's hard to say how much difference it makes.Next I'll try it in one of the two holding bins I have for dry leaves to see how much of a difference it makes.Glad to have a chance to try out this product.  If it speeds up the process, I'll be purchasing more.
I've been working on a compost bin for about a year now, and noticed lately that it wasn't heating up as much as it had in the beginning. When I received the RINGER COMPOST PLUS I added about half the box to my current compost pile (a turning drum style) and by the next day found that the head had returned which means the composting process is back in full swing. My ONLY complaint, and it's minor, is the smell(!) of the contents of the box! You certainly don't want to store it in your home or even in your garage - it's THAT strong. I wrapped mine in plastic to keep it dry and tucked it under a sheltered area near the garden. But hey... smell or no smell, this stuff works!
Starting a compost pile has been on my list of things to do. I was unfamiliar with this product but after reading about it I was impressed.Although it'll take some time to determine if this stuff is a miracle worker, it has gotten me excited about using grass clippings, leaves, and other lawn debris to start a compost pile. The ingredients included in the easy-to-use box will hopefully 'heat up' the pile and get it into compost more quickly.I'll provide an update when I see evidence that it worked. Until then, though, it has gotten me started on composting.
I've had a "passive" compost pile for several years - basically just a big pile of kitchen and yard organics.  After two or three years, I'll start a new pile, and use the good compost from the old one.  Since I've been doing a bit more gardening, I thought a more active, rapid compost would be nice, so I tried the Ringer.  I've followed the directions, kept the pile moist, turned it a bit.  I can't tell much difference, though honestly, I never really looked too closely at the pile before.  It may be decomposing faster, but it isn't a warm pile like I sort of expected.  Maybe it's better - I can't be sure.  So I guess this stuff isn't for me.  If you're a very active composter, then maybe it will work differently or better for you.
But it does seem to work. Added it to a mix of green and brown compost, with an approximate ratio of 1:2, and the mix is warm and decomposing. Essentially this is a bunch of microbes and some nutrients to either accelerate, or perhaps jump-start your compost. If the bacteria are already around, as they would be most places, this product isn't strictly necessary, but could help out with the compost. Hard to tell without a real side-by-side comparison. if you're in a rush though, it's likely to help out.
I have been making compost for several years now. I have a compost tumbler with a crank handle that rotates it. I started a batch in late winter and was having a hard time getting it to heat up. This compost starter did a great job of really getting it going. If it is really cold outside you will have to be more careful to have your ingredients shredded and in the proper carbon to nitrogen ratio. Otherwise this starter will work well if you have more brown than green. In the summer when I am composting mostly greens, then this starter is pretty much unnecessary. I save some of the finished compost from each batch to start the new batch with. If you are doing a passive pile then this stuff is even more of a help because you can add it to each new layer as you build the pile.
I have a compost bin (two actually) and can't wait to use it in my garden this year! The Compost Plus seems to be making my compost material even better, richer, darker. I love this product! The only issue is that the directions say not to add paper to your compost. What??!! Doesn't everyone add paper? Well, I called the company and after a few passes around the office, I was told, then confirmed by another employee, that they don't want to have to list all the kinds of paper you can and shouldn't use in composting. So, they just wrote 'no paper' on their box. Easier for them I suppose, but I'm glad I called because I love adding old newspaper to mine.  Hope this helps! Happy composting!Sheri - writer, mom, mage
I will have to review this product at the end of the summer to give a better idea of the help/quality of the product.  My first impressions were that this was a small amount of stuff.  I also think that it stinks.  I am going to use it in a compost bin, rather than the recommended ground idea.  I don't like to leave compost on the ground, as it attracts rodents.  So far my stuff has been in there for three weeks.  Will update again later.
We have an open air compost pile that has both yard and kitchen waste. After putting a fresh batch of veggie scraps and egg shells on the pile, I poured the recommended amount of Ringer 3050 Compost Plus 2 over the pile and watered as directed.  A week later I checked the pile and the kitchen waste was already unrecognizable. The Ringer 3050 Composte Plus 2 was doing a nice job of helping the scraps and shells break down.Can't wait till the compost is ready in a couple of months to use in my garden.
When I first bought a rotary barrel-type composter I was really excited to get some nutrient rich material for my garden.  Unfortunately it wasn't that easy.  I followed directions but it never seemed to do what it was supposed to do.  The grass stayed green and wet and the leaves stayed dry and brown.I started using the Ringer Compost Plus over a month ago and I can honestly say that it has made a difference.  FINALLY I am getting the type results that I had been wanting.  There might be another way of accomplishing this without a compost starter but for me this is working just fine.
I have had this since 2011 and used 8-10 times so far with no issues. Best chain saw on a pole for the money. Works great for cutting branches. Beats a hand saw type hands down.After my first use of the chain saw I was thoroughly impressed. It worked great for cutting small to medium size branches. I would highly recommend this product for anyone interested in a chain saw on a pole.Keys to keeping this working well is keep the chain oiled. It does not do this automatically like a normal chain saw.Moving the cord around is kind of a pain but no more then I use this it is fine. I saved a bunch vs a gas unit and maintenance is much easier.
Well had this item for about a month now, and I shall say it is a great saw, the only down side of it is once it is on the pole and fully extended, it is a bit on the heavy side, but other than that this saw is just great, lots of power, blade/bar size is perfect for cutting through damn near everything, easy to use, I mean this thing is so much fun to use it should be illegal :)  Changing unit from pole saw to chain-saw is so simple even a caveman could do it (like me).  So if your looking for a great quality pole-saw/chain-saw I would definitely give this on a try.
This saw is awesome. Took it out for it's first use today. Great power on demand at the push of a button, no worries about gas or oil, just the lube the chain and you're good to go. Sliced through moist maple like butter. Handled branches up to 8" with ease. It did, however, throw its chain after an hour of use, which was entirely my fault; do what you're supposed to, and adjust the tension are the new chain has warmed up (and therefore expanded!) a bit. A great, versatile tool!
Lots of reviews so I'll keep it short.  I've used this both on, and off the pole to the point where if it died I'd still be happy with it, but it's still going strong.  Lots and lots of use.  I keep it sharp, adjusted and use the prescribed 30 weight chain oil.It also allows me to make cuts either from the ground, or on a ladder, when I'm in a better position to get out of the way if something falls.  We've used this to safely make the final cuts on limbs that were still hanging from a gas chain saw cut.
Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated, and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence, no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn, so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side.
Besides the cost of propane and attractant cartridges you have to buy about every 21 days, you need to figure in the cost of using 1 of the CO2 Quick-clean cartridges at each tank refill, at a cost of about $4 each. Depending on what you pay for the propane, attractant and CO2 cartridges, it sums up to a cost of $20 around or more at each tank refill. Since you have to refill the propane tank, replace the attractant and use the Quick-clean every 21 days, this adds up to an operating cost of over $400 per year! I'm posting this because it is something you may need to budget for and should seriously consider before buying.
It worked great for one season but when I went to start it up for this season it wouldn't start. I did everything the manual and website said to do when I put it away last fall and did everything the manual and website said to start it up this spring, including wasting three of the "clean out" cartridges and it still doesn't work. Plan on buying a new one every year if this is the one you choose.  Their tech support does not answer emails and the wait for them to answer the phone is nearly endless.Bottom line: avoid this product.
Expensive hunk of junk.  Orig. purchase date Nov. 2006, after the first one we'd bought quit working just a little after the warranty period ended.  The 'head' on this Defender has been repaired three times and replaced twice.  If you get a replacement head from them, there is no additional warranty past your original purchase date (even though they sent you a new one!).  Save your money for something else.  Ours is dead again.  We purchased an inexpensive replacement plan through Amazon, but we're done with the Defender-we're throwing it away.
I bought these last fall thinking they'd be great to trim the grass along the walk way. I don't remember using them at all last year; today I pulled them out of the storage space in the garage and discovered the blades refuse to close together.  They stay open about an inch and a half!  There is no way to adjust the closure space so I guess I just paid for a piece of junk. Too bad, the other Fiskar products we have are great. They missed to boat on this one and need to go back to the drawing board.
I have had really good luck with Fiskar's products and thought I would give the grass shears a try.  The have lived up to my expectations and then some.  The rotating head is a really nice feature that I've not seen on other brands. When trimming the grass near the concrete steps and brick walkway, the rotating head allows me to get very close so I am able to make an even cut.  The blade is very sharp, even after several uses with no sign of rust.  The blade locks in place and makes storage easy so I don't have to worry about cutting my fingers when reaching for it in the tool shed.  Great product!
Though I have several string trimmers, there are areas best cut by hand - like around the vines climbing the two metal arbors out front. If I accidentally cut those vines, I'll be in big trouble, and so when trimming around those long babied vines I use the Fiskars grass shears.The shears cut well through grass though thick woody stems can stop them in their tracks.  The up and down handle mechanism is comfortable and doesn't cramp my hands like some of the side to side units. I like using these when trimming around the Virginia creepers and any prized flowers that I don't want to harm.After three years the shears still cut well, and though I only use them a few times a year, they're a great tool to have in the garden shed when the need arises. I've noticed that my pair doesn't close all the way when put in the locked position. That has never been a problem.Would I but these black and orange (Oriole colors) shears again? Most definitely.
I purchased this exact model from my local "Wal-Mart" and actually paid more than I would have here, but I needed some clippers and fast.First off, they are not rigid at all..  What I mean is, as long as you are clipping a few blades of grass, you are ok, but really put it to use, and you soon find that it will lock blades and not function. This is due to the very poor construction.  Too much "slop" between the blades often make either both blades lock together or separate so much that nothing is cut.If you really want a good set of clippers that actually work, look further as this is a "novelty" item more than an actual functioning tool.
I bought this thing when they still had the wooden handles.  Being an avid sewer, I am quite familiar with Fiskars scissors and have many pairs that I rely on and have for many, many years.  So, when I saw these at the local garden store, it was a no brainer in my mind.  SO glad I have these!  Of ALL the tools like this I've owned over the years, this set of Loppers from Fiskars is the only set that hasn't broken, become jammed, or some other weird thing.  I clean them after each use to keep diseases spreading from plant to plant.  They're amazingly easy to use, especially for women, and boy, the clean cuts it makes just makes everything you do a breeze.  One of those items I am SO glad I found!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
Love these loppers - I've been using them for almost a year now.  Great for those jobs where I used to use small hand pruners that took lots & lots of effort (you know those branches that are really too big for hand pruners, but that you don't want to get the big giant loppers out for, so you squeeze & squeeze the pruners until the branch is finally cut??)  These cut SO easily & cleanly that they're a pleasure to use.(As an aside, I had an old pair of Fiskars hand pruners that had become badly misaligned.  I called the company to inquire about how I could fix them, and they just replaced them for me.  Great customer service!)These loppers are really for relatively close branches; should you need to prune branches that are farther away, you'd want to buy longer ones.Highly recommended.
Not long after I bought these I made the mistake of trying to prune old wood that was really too great a diameter for a small pruner and I broke the cutting blade.  Feeling embarrassed, I wrote to Fiskars and asked them if I could buy the part I'd broken.  Instead of replying they sent me a new pruner within days.  I want anyone shopping for garden tools to know that this is a great company that stands behind its products even when their customers fail to use them properly.  How often does that happen these days?  (I now always make the trek to the shed for the larger loppers when I need to cut old, thick branches.)
Has the usual (very slight) fade after 5 months, BUT it is not very noticeable I only mention it because I notice everything (live in SB,Cali and we get moisture/sun every day). The material is thick and sturdy...I bought this for my 48-50 inch grill so it would fully cover the sides and it is working out great. Cover would get 4.5 stars but I rounded down due to the color of green being slightly different, to me, that what it looks like in the photos. Will update after a full summer if it holds up and doesn't crack, then bump up to 5 stars.
I have had this cover on my grill for over a year now in Minnesota, where it has endured a wide range of harsh weather.  The cover has held up wonderfully.  The only word of caution is on the color.  It is clearly shown in the listing as having green left and right panels.  They may be green when you first buy the cover, but they will quickly turn to brown when you put it on your grill.  To me, this is a minor drawback, but others might find it more objectionable.
I bought these to take care of a mosquito larvae problem in my bog garden. They work well and the frogs are not bothered by them at all. I have a few rare green frogs in the bog here and the dunks don't harm them at all. This particular package, however, was very dry and it seemed like they just crumbled after hitting the water. It does not reduce their effectiveness at killing larvae, but it's not a very attractive result, especially if you have water lilies or water plants. You end up with a lot of bits of cork floating around and getting all over everything. Guess that's better than a bunch of mosquitoes, but...
I thought I liked the idea at first and am glad I waited to write a review because when we first got it we were so excited and could not wait to put them in everything until two birds ended up dead and we have more Mosquitos then we know what to do with!We do NOT recommend this to anyone unless you don't care about nature and other living beings!  Also if you enjoy getting bit all the time by all means buy this , but I would never again and I had to drop it off at our neighborhood program which we call STOP program which stands for Stop throwing out pollutants because we found out you cannot throw it in your regular garbage cause it is considered a poison!Terrible product!
These mosquito dunks work!  I purchased them for a small, outdoor fountain that we have sitting amongst our large blue hostas.  We only need about 1/4 of a dunk so we break it & put it in the fountain. It will usually separate so there are several small pieces of mosquito dunk that float around in the fountain. We don't like the looks of it so we're considering putting the dunk under the removable top piece of the fountain. Rain will cause the fountain to overflow & we'll have to replace the mosquito dunk more often because it'll float right over the edge.  I also use a small amount in the saucer of my outdoor plants. So far so good, I haven't seen any mosquito larva in my fountain this year.  Locally, I saw this product for between $9 & 10 dollars.
I bought this to restring my Black and Decker Trimmer. I used to buy the pre-strung cartridges from them, but they cost a small fortune compared to using this. I have re-strung two carts. and have had great success with them after using this product. The line feeds through just like the original line and does not seem to go any more quickly than the original. Definitely a great way to save money if you don't mind spending a few minutes restringing.EDIT - 5/10/12After over 2 seasons of trimming, weedwacking, and edging - I still have tons of string left! What a great investment! My property is not very large, about an average size lot for Southern New Jersey. (around 3500 sq feet of lawn space).
Ok....I have not had to re-string my weed-eater yet, but two things with this item. I bought this because it was recommended by Amazon with the purchase and the cost was reasonable.The things you should know..............1) Realize you are purchasing a spool of trimmer line, not a package that you can just plug into your trimmer. When I get to where I have re-strung the trimmer I bought (the GreenWorks 21212 4 Amp 13&#34; Corded String Trimmer) I will update this.2) The string seems to be of a much heavier gauge than what shipped with the trimmer. Again, I will update when I re-string, but I am hoping the replacement string will work fine.Again, I don't know all the specifics, but  I wanted to alert people to the oddities I encountered in the purchased and visual examination.  It may work just fine and when I get to that point where I am actually using it, I will update the review and star rating.
I cooked a Turkey on my Charcoal Rotisserie for Thanksgiving 2010. I used the Pecan Wood Chips according to the instructions on the bag, and WOW!!! They put a taste into that Turkey that is hard to describe!!  It was so delicious and jucy. I always wondered what Pecan Wood smoke would do to meat, and now I know. No turning back now. I must try some Ribs with these chips next, and a Roasting Chicken.....mmmmmmmmm!!  Highly recommended. Will purchase again.
I couldn't find this at my two local hardware stores, they didn't stock any bar and chain oil surprisingly. I used this in my newHusqvarna 450 18-Inch 50.2cc X-Torq 2-Cycle Gas Powered Chain Saw With Smart Start (CARB Compliant)and it works great. They don't recommend you use any motor oil or different purposed oil so I definitely recommend this product. I had some husqvarna chain oil in my last chainsaw for years, and to be honest I can't find any difference in noticeable viscosity or functionality of that product over this (it was a lot more expensive).
If you do a lot of tree trimming or cutting you know the value of good chain oil.  You need to use it to prolong the life of your chain and bar for your chain saws.  I just trimmed 18 large trees and this oil helps to cut quickly through the large branches and protect and extend the life of your expensive chainsaw parts.The thing about chainsaw oil is that it is stickier than regular oil because of an additive to enhance the viscosity and it stays on the bar better to lubricate it while it is doing its job.  It also does not sling off the chain as quickly as motor oil. When oil slings off the chain and bar, a lot of it is going onto you, your clothes and shoes. When you are trimming a tree above your head it is nice to have it not dripping back down onto you.This is a good product and I recommend it!
After testing 4 areas of soil and a couple of control tests, none of these test results could be trusted.1. Tested lemon juice fresh from a lemon: pH read "6"... when it should have been the lowest value on the chart or more (pH of nearly 2 is lemon, so these tests give unreliably "alkaline" results). The purified water test also came out "alkaline".  All of the yard samples also came up as the most alkaline result, 7.5.2. Tested freshly decomposed manure compost exactly to the package directions: none of the K, P, or N tests reacted at all after 10 minutes, 20, 30... or even 24 hours later. Manure compost should at least read "adequate" for nitrogen! None of the soil samples from the yard reacted either, so the indicating agent in the capsules is useless.So, all in all, it was a tremendous waste of money and time.
A decent quality product that appears to be more or less accurate however, I'm not thrilled with the fairly ambiguous rating system for the test results:  I conducted all four tests on a veggie garden soil sample.  The pH test was great - clear results.  The N, K and P test parameters are pretty loose, though.  Essentially, you can tell whether your soil is deficient but it's pretty difficult to discern the difference between the &#34;adequate&#34; reading and the reading indicating an overabundance of the given substance.  I posted a customer pic on the vendor's listing to illustrate results.  Who knows if they will post it.  I don't think I would re-purchase this item.
I am  Master Gardener and I must admit I broke the Cardinal rule of gardening, I never test my ground.  Even when the MG program offered it to me for free when I graduated, I could not be bothered.  I thought I could adjust my garden when I needed it myself without any help from a test kit.  Until I moved, this house has a wonderful piece of property that I use for my vegetable garden and for the first three years everything was perfect, until this year.  Nothing wants to grow, so I broke down and bought this item, low an behold I have a problem, nothing major but my phosphorous is completely depleted and that is the explanation for the way my veggies are growing.  I found out what must be done and I did it and everything is turning around..Good sound product I recommend it to the gardener that thinks he/she knows it all, (but we really don't.)
I like the 10" size.  It holds a substantial pot, whether you change the plant three times a year, or keep one perennial as I do.  The holder goes onto your deck rail in a few minutes.  While it is not heavy duty, it will hold even a tall pot easily and securely.  Holds enough soil for a second story deck like mine to trail a vine twenty feet, or a huge Swiss or trailing begonia.  Not much else to say except no problems and sturdy enough to last for years.
This hanger works great for hanging my potted plants from my side porch. I don't have an overhang to hang plants from hangers, so prior to this, I was only able to set my flowers out on my side porch on my table, not hang them. This holder slides right over the railings of my porch and lets me hang flowers off the side so they are viewable from my driveway and the street out front. It's also a nice solution when you don't want to drill anything permanent into your porch to hang flowers. Just slide this holder over a railing and set your potted flowers inside, that's all there is to it! I like that I can also move this to other areas of my porch, if my flower are in need of more sun.
This attractive black pot holder installs easily. I appreciated the versatility as it can fit 2 x4" to 2x 6" inch railing. I am not mechanically inclined but was able to affix this to my deck with no problems. It is designed with a "bumper" which prevents the pot from tipping. The black color should blend with just about any d&eacute;cor.This is a convenient way for me to keep a pot of fresh herbs in close proximity to the grill on my deck.  The hardware seemed a bit flimsy but so far it has held. This is a good way to bring a color to your deck, balcony or fence. Recommended.
CobraCo's adjustable flower pot holder is a flexible product that can be used to fit on deck railing up to 4 inches across.  The brackets easily attach in 1 of 2 configurations depending on the width of your rail.  There are 3 screws on each side to lock the bracket down.  There is a bottom bumper support to rest against a post or rail to keep the plant level.  The holder easily accommodates a plant pot of up to 10 inch diameter.This is an easy way to beautify your deck.  Just add plant, and water.
I chose this item for an indeterminate tomato plant.  After I initially set this holder at the desired spot, I then assembled this with my hands before my husband brought his power screw driver in to complete the job. The brackets are now securely mounted on our back porch.  I noticed that the brackets can be used from either the long or the short side, depending on how wide the frame or sill is.The holder leans a little down but that is the desired effect I want, so that the plant can benefit from the western sun late in the afternoon.  The deep brackets keep this holder from getting blown off in our strong spring winds.
This is a good, standard pot holder.  The metal construction is sturdy and it keeps my plant perfectly perched on my wood railing (a plus because some of the non-adjustable holders I've found are meant for a skinnier metal railing and don't work for my situation).  So functionality wise, these have been perfect.  But aesthetically, it still pretty utilitarian looking.  There's really nothing in the way of ornamentation or decoration.  Because of that, I like using this with a pot that is well designed and pretty on it's own.Aesthetics aside, it functions as expected and is perfect for people (like me) whose railings are not a uniform size.
Decent quality though not quite as sturdy as I would have wanted.Good news though, it fits 6" or less rails with an adjustable arm.  My package had all the items included.  Some folks complained the brackets weren't included but I noticed mine were just lying in the bottom of the box separate from the rest of the item.  Perhaps the customer missed them or perhaps the shipper missed them.  Not sure.  But without those it is useless.Holds a 10 inch pot.  Looks nice.  Just wish the metal was a bit better quality.  I worry it might wear, bend, or break over time.  I will update if this occurs.
When I originally set this up on our front porch railing, I was very pleased with the ease of it.  I was able to do it rather quickly and without assistance.  I chose to put a flower pot that has trailing vines in it, that way the frame would be hidden a bit and it looked great.  If I were to rate this item on that alone, it would get 5 stars.  But then I was at our local hardware & garden center and saw similar pot holders for half the price.  I ended up buying two of them in the same 10 inch size top add more pots to our front deck and they were just as easy to install and work just as well.  So for this I do drop this item down to 3 stars.  Don't get me wrong it's a good item, but why pay more than you should? I definitely recommend shopping around if saving money is as important to you as it is to me.
I can't get over how easily this product changes to fit my needs.  I have a wide railed deck railing outside and  narrow railed wrought iron railing around a balcony in my living room inside.  I can switch this within in minutes to fit either railing.I don't know how long it will have to be out in the weather to affect the paint on this, but I tried a sharp knife  and it took a very sharp one and a lot of pressure to even scratch this - but yes it does scratch under a lot of abuse.It is built so that it has a piece in the back that acts a bit like a stabilizer so that the flower pot will not be at to sharp of an angle -water/heavy rain will drain out but the soil will stay inside the pot.
I have this attached to my rails on my back porch.  I just planted a bunch of geraniums(red and white)and put the pot into the holder when I was done.  Very sturdy-that was one thing that I was afraid of was that it was going to fall over. But the brackets are very firm-dont think I will have a problem with them this summer.Nice product. It looks better when you get it. When I saw it on Amazon it looked very cheap but not when you get it.Might buy a couple more to match the one I just got!
It is flexible, can hold 50+ pounds (lbs), and sit on practically any railing up to 6-inch wide incl. thin panels of thick glass thanks to the clever design of the adjustable attachment brackets.  You can ignore the manufacturer's claim that the bracket can adjust 2-6 inches.  When using only 1 or 2 bracket's bolts (of 3) closest to the pot's bowl - after bending down the end of the horizontal flat (bar) of the L-shaped clasp - the vertical clasp's flat (bar) holding the pot can be fastened as close to the bowl as 0 inches.  It is safe to use just 1 bolt, as the distribution of even a high vertical load results in a very small horizontal component force, which can very little pull (shear away) the bolts, one of which can easily handle.  However, the overall look is less than inspiring.
So this flow pot is adjustable, can attach to deck railing, and will, in fact, hold a flow pot.  So as far as meeting expectations to the letter, sure, it worked out.  It's OK.But actually using it brings up some downsides.  The metal, while strong, when supporting a wide-based pot, seems like it's taxing its available strength to hold the bot up.  Also, depending on the pot, the side rails may be too high or, in my case, far to low to hold a tall pot in a way that looks and feel secure.  Nothing has broken or fallen out, but...I'm just waiting for it to happen.Overall, it's an OK adjustable pot holder, but it doesn't impress me very much and really isn't any better than average.
This is a nice sturdy product but it doesn't work well on my deck railing.  I have a board railing with slats, rather than a thick beam, and the unit just falls off if bumped.  When I move it so it sets against the slat it doesn't lie flat on the top.I can secure it by putting another screw or bolt behind the rail, but it's not supposed to need that. If you plan to order these, get just one first, and make sure it will work for you before buying enough for all your petunias.
No way does this product perform as promised.  And what a waste of time it was trying to make it work!I don't think this company considered all the possible railing configurations before making its claims.We have a wooden railing on our deck.  At the top of the rail, one 2x4 is on end and it is topped by a 2x4 laying flat.  Any which way we tried it, it did not hold, would not grip the railing and kept falling forward. The screws are on the bottom of the L-shaped arms that are supposed to hug the railing.  How in the world are you supposed to tighten them when they are facing the railing?  Only if you assemble it OFF the railing; then you can't get it ON the railing.(I think I got all the parts:  I received the basket, two L-shaped arms, six flat-head screws and six plastic cap nuts.)
The printed instructions on this wire hanging flower pit leave a little to be desired, but I can't complain about the adjustability. The bracket part really does accommodate a large variety of ledges and edges.The holder looks unassuming when hanging over the fence, and is big enough for most medium plant pots. It looks GREAT with a flowering plant draping down over the edges.The black vinyl coating is nice and should help keep this from getting rusty too soon. It seems pretty strong, and the weight of a potted plant seems to stabilize things quite well.For some reason, my set came with four extra metal brackets, and a ton of extra bolts. I wasn't able to figure out what to do with the extra brackets, which are metal, like the entire set-up. I will probably recycle them, unless I can figure out a reason to keep them around.
This is a wonderfully realized product. Whether mounted over narrow or wide railings, the included brackets configure securely for either wide or narrow installations.The ten-inch option that I acquired has a depth of five and a half inches - eight inch baskets are also available, both in either black or white. The construction is sturdy. The bumper that keeps the holder level against the vertical support of the mounting area is rounded, so that no matter where I install this, I am not at all worried about scuffs, scratches or unsightly indentations.I love CobraCo's Adjustable Flower Pot Holder. This is the perfect item for helping to get another flower pot up and out of the way. It's well-built, it's easy to use and it really livens things up.
We have coyote fences in my neck of the wood which are Latilla wood rods wrapped around an iron post. It's not always easy to find something which will hang easily on the inside of the fence, which is why I was interested to see this planter design. I find it works perfectly although it may be just a tad too flimsy for anything with a substantial weight. That being said, I think it will hold up lighter plants with no problems whatsoever.It looks well built and the adjustable part screwed together nicely. The other nice part about this is that you can move it wherever the sun is and then move it back to a shady place to rest for a while. It's a nice idea and I will recommend it to my neighbors who are always trying to figure out gadgets so they can hang flowers on their coyote fences.
We have all different types of fencing in our yard--split rail, decking and wood fence. The CobraCo flower pot holder accommodates them all.  It has a nifty L-shaped clasp that adjusts two ways to hang from virtually any support--for thinner railings (2-4") and thicker railings (4.5-6").  I was worried this pot holder would be like so many others that tilt forward on an angle when a heavy plant is actually sitting in it.  To my delight, it sits perfectly vertical, thanks to another nice feature, a bumper that hits up against rails and prevents any slant.  This is a generous sized pot holder.  It can fit up to 10" pots, and if weight is an issue, it could also hold a large coco fiber liner instead.  One of my favorite summer pastimes is relocating flower baskets, and this is the perfect gardening companion.
This is a nice, versatile pot holder for any sort of railing.  We live in a townhouse, and each unit has a fenced-in, concrete patio.  There's really no place to plant flowers, so a container garden is an only option.  I didn't want many containers crowding the ground of my small patio, so I opted for hanging them places.This pot holder is exactly what I needed.  It's 10 inches at the top, and will accommodate a range of flower pots.  The fastener is adjustable, to make them useful in a wide variety of locations.  I was able to fit it to our fencing perfectly.  It's sturdy and well-made, and I expect it will last through many cycles of flowers.
This is a no frills Adjustable Flower Pot Holder, but it doesn't really need any frills. There is no fancy ironworks on this one, but it really doesn't need it as long as it works.  I put this on on my 4" railing and it felt secure. I lined mine with the brown liners that come from hardware store so that you just have to put in the dirt and it looks great!  It can hold up to a 10" pot of flowers and that's pretty wide!  All in all, I like it!  This on is Vinyl-coated steel and the longer one the same company makes is Powder-coated steel and feels much more substantial.  Couldn't ask for anything to be different.
First of all this does what it is supposed to and in that it is a fine product.However,Took me awhile to figure out how to get it to work (directions not so clear and not 100% self explanatory)The screws and slides allow for probably most desk rail widths.  But the tricky part is that there is a support on the pot which requires that it be braced against a post or a baluster/picket.  My deck railing has a very old style (and no longer code) style "X" between posts.  This left very little spacing options for where the pot could be placed.  From below it looks lovely but a direct look at it the two anchors to the railing don't looks so neat (tempted to place a pot on top of them to hide them).
Over the years I have tried a number of flower pot holders and have always been disappointed with the quality of them. This flower pot holder is made of strong and sturdy steel that is vinyl coated and rust proof so I don't have to worry about rust stains on my deck rails or the holder hanging crooked because of the flower pot weight. It can hold up to 10" flower pots or even several small flower pots so it has great versatility. It was easy to install and looks simple, yet gorgeous. The only thing I didn't like was having to drill my new deck to install the flower pot holder. Overall, it's a great item that's a cut above the rest.
This is a substantial, yet almost invisible pot holder. Come to think of it, though, I have a light pot and plant in it; if I had this attached to a railing on a second story or higher railing, I would think twice about placing a heavy pot in it for fear that it might break and fall. I like it fine on our first floor railing.The nuts to adjust the holder could be better. I would suggest using stainless steel wing nuts--or even plastic with brass thread insert knobs--to replace the acorn nuts. Even with those changes, this is still a reasonably-priced plant pot holder.
This is a simple sturdy product that works.  It is holding a potted Geranium easily on my porch railing.This is easy to put together. When you hang this on a railing the flower pot holder is held securely thanks to two brackets and a bottom overhang.There are three screws on each side of the top of the flower pot holder.  There are two brackets that the screws hold.  On the bottom of the flower pot holder there is a four and a half inch by two and a half inch overhang on the back of the holder. The brackets and the bottom overhang secure the flower pot holder in place.The instructions say this will work on iron, aluminum and wood top railings up to 2 3/4 and wooded 2x4 and 2x6 railings.  It fits up to 10 inch pots.This is sturdy and seems like it is made to last.
I really like this Flower Pot Holder.  It fits great on the railing that leads down my back steps.  It was quick and easy to set-up and it's a really nice quality.  It holds my flower pots really well.  It's nice, simple & basic.Having just one of these seems odd.  I would definitely recommend getting yourself a set.  I think they would look better if you had 2 spaced out just a little bit from each other.I like this Flower Pot Holder and I would recommend it.
Cobra's 10-inch adjustable flower pot works well for those who would like a pot that can mount to their deck or patio railing and hold a pot up to 10-inches in diameter at the top (and 7 inches in diameter at the base). The adjustable railing brackets have screw/bolt combinations that will accommodate railing widths between 2 and 6 inches. The pot is simple to adjust, install, and use. It will accommodate plastic, wood, metal, or clay pots as long as the dimensions are correct. The neutral black color works well anywhere.
On the product label it says this pot holder is "for decks, balconies and fences".  The planter has U shaped brackets that are designed to slip over a flat 2x4 or 4x4 or 2x6 railing, but this design doesn't work on a privacy fence.  My fence has no top mounted 2x4 so there is no place to hook the bracket.  I even tried screwing the brackets into the fence's 4x4 post, but the pot's brackets are 4 1/2" apart so that didn't work either.In the end I just hung the pot on the wooden support of glider/swing that I have on the patio.  Not exactly where I wanted the pot holder, but an okay place I guess.
Havahart 1020 - Small rodentsI have a larger Havahart from about 20-25 years ago that works to this day and is able to catch squirrels without any difficulty. The wire mesh on that model is too big for small field mice, so I bought this 1020 to hopefully catch some of these smaller mice and rats. They tend to crawl into my engine compartment and store seeds or other rubbish.The 1020 is quite small and light weight. Its construction isn't very good, everything seems thinner and lighter than the older design. The bait tray is easily sprung. A gust of wind will set it off, and it renders it useless in windy conditions outside. Understandably, a field mouse is going to be quite light so a heavier trap may not spring when the mouse touches the tray. Unfortunately, this also makes the 1020 very touchy. I recommend using it indoors or in a covered area close to the suspected location of the critters.Overall: 4/5 stars, the construction could be better, but time will tell
I just bought an emergency back-up generator.  It's just like a snow thrower.  It you buy it, you probably will never need it and it becomes another gas-fired device that needs maintenance.  Unfortunately, we need both.  Ocassional power outages and significant snow storms here in Maryland do happen.  Even though we hopefully will never have another 40&#34; monster storm like the one a few winters ago, we do have frequent violent storms enough to justify the generator and I just about wore out my snow thrower on that one storm alone.  I think we're do for more.  Hence the generator cover.
When I was looking for a nice storage box for my front porch -- I ordered this product based on the other reviews.  They were right!  It WAS easy to put together.  Less than 2 minutes, no tools, no kidding.  It's very sturdy and doubles as overflow seating when necessary.  Very handy.  I even went back and ordered the larger one.  One note on the color:  It's more of a light taupe than the whiteish tone you see in the picture.  No matter. I highly recommend it.
It took all of 5 minutes to assemble except for the top. That took about 4 more minutes to figure out. This product literally snaps together - no tools needed except for the top which they claim just snaps on like the other pieces. Maybe if your a body builder you have the strength to bend the tab by hand but I couldn't.There is a simple solution - after sliding the right side hinge into place - use a medium sized flat blade screw-driver inserted between the tab and the hinge and carefully bend the hinge back toward the right and slide the hinge over the tab and your done.I doubt that if left out in a heavy rain-it would be water tight - but that is not an issue for me since I am using it to store ceramic & stainless steel accessories for my Ceramic Egg Grill/Smoker.
We try to keep unused containers stored upside down to prevent standing water that leads to mosquitoes breeding.However, my garden area consists of raised beds and earthboxes around the perimeter.  The earthboxes have reservoirs that hold water and mosquitoes often breed in them, leading to a garden full of mosquitoes.It really helps to drop some Mosquito Bits into the fill tube of each earthbox during the season.  I have a few other large containers that have attached saucers that fill with water.  They get some bits added too.This product works well.  A container lasts for quite awhile and makes it much easier to be in the garden and yard.
For every soil sample I tested this powder with, it indicated it was 7.5 ph.  I even tried some of my almost pure peat mix in it and it said it was 7.5, which is the highest the meter will go so I'm assuming it's just bad powder.  I tested the same soil in the other compartment with my liquid ph tester (also bought on here, good stuff), and it showed the real PH values (5.0 for my peat mix), 6.5 for my other regular soil.  So it gets to keep a star because I'll use the container for testing with my liquid ph tester.
Soil from different areas of the yard test a bit differently, and I got repeat results. This would indicate the tests are at least consistent and sensitive enough to be of use. I'm happy to at least have a good idea of the soil and don't have to worry that it is way off. Since a couple of fruit trees were not so hot, I wondered about that. As it turns out, all my areas are a bit acidic, so I amended the soil and hope for good results.What people say about the small capsules is true. Pretty darn tiny and probably very difficult for many people to use without spilling. What would bigger capsules cost?  Nothing probably.Five stars if it would also kill gophers and weeds.
Inexpensive, this kit consists of ten single use tablets.  Instructions are clear and the contents -- a vial, ten test tablets and an eye dropper for water -- are well-designed.  For the price, it provided me peace of mind on my growing conditions and prevented me from pH conditioning the soil where it did not need conditioning.On the downside, readings are not precise.  You'll get a good idea of the general soil pH within a .5 reading, but nothing specific.  That's probably okay, however.  Most times soil conditions are not exact from place to place anyhow and a general idea is what most of us need.
It is a very simple yet effective test when someone needs to know the ph of soil (outside for the most part).The ONLY CON i have with this test is the pill capsules filled with the reactive powder which in the end is the catalyst for the color. You do need ph'd water or a very distilled water to test your soil with. If you use tap, you are taking the chance of an off reading due to the ph of your tap water. For the price and complexity it is well worth it. Not a perfect 5 stars but 4 is an understatement.
I love this hedge trimmer!  I have a fair number of bushes and hedges that need trimming, but always hated having to trim them mainly becuase of the tools.  I had a corded model (also a B&D;) that cut very well, but the cord was always a real pain -- it always got snagged on something, and I ended up spending more time dealing with the cord than actually trimming. Looked into a gas model, but the weight was an issue, as well as the noise.The cordless B&D; is a fantastic tool! It lets you concentrate on the trimming. Ready to go in a second (no cord to unwind and plug in) and the battery lasts a decent interval. No, it's not an everlasting battery that will run for hours, but that's an easy problem to solve -- just get a second battery so if the first one gives up before you're done, you just pop in another.Nicely balanced and easy to handle. Highly recommend!!
This cordless trimmer has plenty of power and makes short work of bushes and shrubs around my house.  Uses the same 18V battery as my B&D; drill, so it's nice to have a spare if I need it.  First time I used it, I went out planning to spend 5 minutes or so trying it out.  Instead, I was outside over 45 minutes and got most of my trimming done.  I've never used a corded trimmer, but I can imagine how much trouble it would be to deal with the cord.  This is quick and easy.I think the main thing about a battery operated hedge trimmer is that you need to take care of the battery.  Keep the battery in a moderate temperature environment (don't leave it in your freezing garage or storage building), and keep it charged.  If the trimmer doesn't run for long right out of the box, you probably have a defective battery.
I bought the B&D Cordless Hedge trimmer a few weeks ago based on the comments made by the people here in the reviews.  I am very pleased with my purchase. I found the power to be adequate for trimming shrubs around the yard. I didn't find the weight a problem as did some who reviewed it. The safety lock is an inconvenience. As some did, I fixed it to where it would stay in the locked position. It makes a big difference. Time will tell how the batteries will hold up. So far I have no complaints. I would recommend this trimmer
I love this little blower!  I can grab it at a moment's notice and blow the leaves, pine needles, and other debris out of my courtyard.  SOOO much easier than dragging out the corded electric blower for quick light jobs!  Fits my "girl hands" nicely, not too heavy, not too noisy, lasts about 15 minutes.  For the big jobs, I'll still get out the "monster" electric blower that works like a hurricane coming through, but with this little guy I find myself blowing leaves and stuff frequently now, instead of dreading getting out the big one for a small job.  I'm going to look at the other items they make that uses the same battery pack too.
Purchased as part of the home care package this little blower is great for loose material on hard or semi hard surfaces. While it doesn't have the power of my 230 mph corded one, there is one application where it shines.Even on a low setting the "high power" blower will always blow mulch off the beds when trying to clean out leaves and grass from among the scrubs. Getting the cord through all the shrubs is no picnic either.Provided it's dry, this little guy gets in between the bush's, shrubs, plants without blowing all the bedding into the yard, saving a few hours of raking.
I've had this electric broom for about a year. It lacks the power of a corded blower but nonetheless it does the job for me. I use it to clean up the sidewalk and driveway after mowing the lawn or after a windy period leaves a mess. It works great and I can do my front yard and back yard areas on a single battery charge.I wouldn't recommend this for blowing leaves off a lawn as it may not have enough force to make that job easy. I don't own another blower and don't expect to because I don't feel I need to. In the fall when our trees drop their leaves we rake them.We now have four B&D; tools that use the same type of 18V battery. All four batteries are constantly in their charging stations so are always ready for use in any of the four tools. This is a successful design that is flexible for our use.
Still works same as when I first bought it.  It's not a high-powered blower, and it will go thru the battery pretty quick, but if you want to just grab a blower to blow off your patio or driveway without dealing with cords or anything this is great.  I've got a ton of concrete around my front and back yards and two batteries does the trick.  If for some reason I want something really high-powered I will pull out the old corded blower, but it's rare.  My common use is blowing off sidewalks after mowing the grass.
Great little machine. For less than 100 bucks you get a trimmer that does a good job. Can be used as an edger also. I don't have large property but I can use this maybe 3 times before charge runs out. They give you two batteries with it and you can always have the backup charged and ready. Why mess with gasoline and mixing oil. Just turn this on and go. Very light weight and easy to manuever. Can adjust the height to suit your needs and no bumbing to advance the string. More convienent than gas or electric and not alot of money.
No more dragging 200 feet of extension cord out when it's time to do some yard trimming. This thing is light weight, strong enough for moderate trimming, and no gas or cords to deal with. It's much like a cordless screwdriver or drill, use it, plug it back in...use it again. It's the ease of it all that makes it a winner. If you plan on taking down HEAVY brush etc...go for the cord, but for maintenance around the yard...this is it!
I live in one of those communities that have common grounds which are kept up by a service; as a result, I only have to tend the grounds in and around my house.  I used to have to lug a power cord out to do it.  With this device, though, I can charge it up overnight and then bounce outside for perhaps 3 minutes of effort at the most.  You have not experienced convenience until you've had the luxury of no gas and pullcord startup or long troublesome power cord, just a battery powered tool.  It is definitely not for large estates, but for simple short jobs, it is perfect.
I can not believe that I am using the same animal others have reviewed. I looked on the box to be sure. This is my third year and it is still working as well as the first time I tried it. I have a small lawn and what used to be reachable by mower is now only reachable by trimmer. With all the compost I use and other earthy products, the lawn has risen above the driveway and sidewalk. By using the "Groom 'N' Edge" button to rotate the trimmer head 180 degrees to convert the trimmer to an edger, I not only groom the lawn but also cut away the overflow dirt. Maybe this is why I seem to use more Black & Decker AF-100 String than the average reviewer. I think this thing will never fall apart; if it does I will go cordless.
Purchased as part of the cordless homecare package this trimmer is by far the best unit for our subdivision home. As the homecare package has three batteries and a three bank charger we're never out of power. It will do medium to light trimming and edging without skipping a beat. Light and easy to use, just pick-up and go. The cordless broom cleans up the mess in and flash and your done!Gone are the years of frustration and struggle weilding a gas powered unit, or getting sore yanking the cord trying to start it. Or (ok, I admit it) throwing the gas powered units on the ground in frustration and disgust.
I purchased this trimmer in May 2008 and I am very happy with it.  I have used it about 5 times.  The majority of my weed trimming is done by a yard service, but I needed a trimmer for touch up and weed trimmer in areas outside the lawn.  It is very nice to put in a battery and go.  Battery life is good.  I can get about 20 minutes of hard use (briars, thick weeds) and about 40 minutes of light use (grass) out of a fresh battery.  The unit comes with two batteries.  I have changed the "string" once and it was easy.  The trimmer is light and quiet. May experience with the cordless trimmer resulted in me purchasing the B&D cordless pole hedge trimmer.  They use the same battery, which is very helpful.  All and all very good product, if you understand your getting a light duty trimmer.
I love B&D; tools and have a variety of 18v tools.  I never really owned many gardening tools and decided to buy this and give it a whirl...no pun intended. :-)  The package comes with 2 18v batteries, a spindle of twine, and the hog it self.  Charged one of the batteries for 18 hours or so and off I went to get rid of weeds.  PERFECT....this worked for about 30 minutes on full power and 15-20 minutes on half power with one full  battery.I was impressed...as the 18v electric broom died in 20 minutes...I have now used it about a dozen times and my results are exactly the same....  Replacement twine is avail on Amazon and  your your local big store... :-)5/5 - Great Product, Great Value...especially for us beginners.
I have a large bay window with a window seat in my kitchen that gets natural light from three sides. In the spring the seat pads get stashed and out comes and insulated mat that covers the surface, this heat mat, and plant tray with fortified planting material for seedlings or plant cuttings. This mat keeps the plant tray warm and encourages rapid growth without doing much more than keeping the plants warm and fed. In a matter of 3-4 days, the plants sprout and show root growth.I like this mat because I get fast and effective results with this every time I use it. It's a good product that pays for itself with its success rate and the fact that it makes me feel like a gardening pro.
This little device worked like a charm starting my seeds last winter. I couldn't believe how much quicker it took for them to germinate when using this mat. I put it on a timer with my lights and found it easy to use and setup. It kept a nice warm temperature, never getting too hot. Hopefully it will last for quite awhile as I only get to use it a few weeks a year.UPDATE - Year 2 -Seed mat is working as designed again this year. I need to get another one as I have doubled the amount of seeds I am growing. Definitely recommend this product.
I have used this to help germinate some cucumbers I started indoors in a small greenhouse tent. At night when the grow lights are unplugged the inside get fairly chilly like the rest of the house, but with this heat mat I can leave it on all night and not have to worry about the seedlings. I would say it keeps the inside temperatures a good 10 degrees warmer than without it. I found the cord to be a little short but it's really no big deal. Before purchasing I compared this with the ones for sale on Gardener's Supply and this seemed to be much better value for the size.
This is our third year growing tomatoes upside down, so to speak.  At first I was dubious, but now we look forward to growing our own tomatoes.  We have one for large roma tomatoes and another for small cherry tomatoes.  We have to grow these up and away from wild turkeys that roam in our neighborhood looking to eat any and all fresh vegetable shoots.  We placed them on an upper deck with a drip system.  For optimal growth we have them hanging up against the house so more heat bounces off the house onto the plants; heat is ideal for growing tomatoes.  We regularly trim and pinch off new growth so that all the energy goes into the tomatoes.Four star:  These are plastic and are only useable for one year.  I have had a couple of the plastic breakdown before the fruit bearing season was over and had to duct tape it back together.  We will keep using these for our particular situation.  We love our fresh tomatoes.
This may look like a gimmick to you but it's not.  This planter can actually grow tomatoes and other vegetables.  All you need is a sunny place to hang it.  If you live in an apartment or otherwise have no garden space, try this.  They call it a tomato planter but it actually should be called a vegetable planter.  Last summer I grew tomatoes, bell peppers and cucumbers in them.  I believe it needs to contain more soil (larger) to be an ideal tomato planter.  It grew lots of tomatoes but peppers and cucumbers did even better.  One trick to know (not applicable for tomatoes)- take the top plastic cover off and plant 2 vegetable plants per topsy turvy-- one in the top and one in the bottom.
Especially with cherry and grape sized tomatoes. Amazing production, it's out of the way, well-engineered, they even include a nice big metal hook to hang it with! The plastic-fabric sides WILL disintegrate in a couple-three years, so don't expect this to be a lifetime purchase. But it works great, you'll have more tomatoes than you'll know what to do with! I ordered two of these to replace the single one I had bought a couple years ago. Very clever idea, highly recommended! HINT: don't use cheap potting soil!
I am a Master Gardener, which in my state means I need to have continuing education each year and teach minimum amount of hours.  We can't teach old wive's tales, just scientifically proven plant info (but some of the old wive's tales have been proven, so they are O.K. :-) ). These upside-down planters have been a big discussion point and unbiased studies have been done on their effectiveness.  They have been proven to produce less than conventionally grown plants.  I am giving two stars for the novelty factor, but I would never recommend them for anyone who actually wants tomatoes.More work + more expensive + less fruit = thumbs down
This does exactly as advertised. The Black Russian Truffle Tomato i put in mine was growing famously. Actually, it's growth was fairly unprecedented, until....the whole thing fell and the plant's main stem was crushed. See, when the planter is watered properly, it is also incredibly heavy for its size. So, the lesson there would be to make sure whatever you hang it from can hold quite a bit of weight. I would say it needs to be able to hold at least twenty pounds, since the total weight of a fully grown plant with the planter and all the requisite soil and watering will at least end up weighing this much. It might be safer to shoot for 30 pounds though. However, that was a user error problem on my part for not planning properly. The planter itself is great. You cant overwater, as any excess will simply run out the bottom. A good solid and inexpensive purchase.
Bought two after watching neighbor's do fairly well except for watering neglect.This year will have her hang closer to our yard so we can keep eye on it.These two, when set, will be accessible to daily watering as needed.  It doesn't look to be any 'foam ring' in these 2.  BUT one can always stir 'foam packing peanuts' into dirt/potting mixture, which will create some lightness to over all hanging weight, as well as help with water retention.As to Fabric rotting/giving out after one season vs the earlier reviews. Sounds like the typical of past 4 yrs of IMPORTED product where the MFG has reduced the quality of the fabric.
This product works as advertised, my tomatoes are doing very well.  However, it is VERY heavy when filled with dirt and watered.  You need a sturdy hook and place to hang it.  I was having problems with it drying out quickly (granted, I live in New Mexico, where it is quite dry) even though I had added water absorbing crystals to the soil.  I ended up removing the top 6 inches of soil and placing a plastic milk jug in the top.  I punched some holes in the bottom of the jug and I fill this with water nearly every day.  The water then slowly seeps in to the soil instead of running out the bottom, dripping is reduced and the plant gets the water it needs.  I would give it five stars if some system were in place to keep it from dripping so I could use it indoors and if it were a little easier to plant.
This is the second 4 foot hydrofarm grow light ive purchased.  I bought one last year and then again one this year. (The first one still works great)  I use the grow light for my seed starter kits and noticed that the seedlings directly under the light grow alot stronger and healthier than the ones on the outside edges.  So thats where the 2nd light purchase came in.Having the lights hang from the adjustable strings is a pretty nice feature.  As the plants grow you can raise the light up by the pull of a string.The only thing i would change about this light that would make it better would be if it had 2 bulbs so it covers more area.
I've been using this to keep plants alive during the frost, I didn't think they could grow anymore because of the cold. This thing makes them grow! I was surprised. The plants went from about 12 inches tall to about 18 inches. I keep the light on for about 16 hours a day, and if it's warm enough outside I put them out there on a roller.My only con is that the frame could be built better, other than that it's great if you have a few plants you need to keep alive during the winter. It's good even if you want to start plants.
I have a small greenhouse and I'm using this Grow Light to keep my vegetables going. It provides light in Winter to 5 Earthboxes full of vegetables. Does it work? I have 5 planters full of vegetables, some blooming getting ready to fruit, and some squash and cucumbers with fruit on them, and there is ice and snow on the ground outside, very little natural light this time of year.It seems flimsy, and you wouldn't want to kick it around or place it somewhere with lots of traffic and people bumping into it. Otherwise, I haven't a problem with the fact that it isn't SOLID. I move it around a little every day or two to make sure everything is getting some light. It handles that just fine.I'm thinking of getting another one or two. If it wasn't so expensive, I would. I haven't found anything I like better.
As you can see, most of these reviews are very old.  I have one and it is very sturdy and designed quite well. The lifting mechanism works great and is a great improvement over most of the more inexpensive systems that require moving each side separately.  I would definitely recommend this system - its a nice dark forest green and the paint job is excellent - you could put it in the living room and it would look just fine.  I can't comment on shipping and packing as I bought mine at a retail store but I would have to say the package itself seems pretty well packed so if anything breaks I would say the retailer you bought it from did not protect it well enough in the shipping box.  It is, afterall, a lightbulb and should be shipped as such, with plenty of pellets.
When I retired, I wanted to retire my home made pvc light stand.  Mind you, there was nothing wrong with it.  Having said that, these light systems by Hydrofarm are fantastic.  I have four of them and used them all winter.  Packaging and instructions were right on and they are absolutely wonderful. I wondered at the system for raising the light up and down because it seemed so simple.  Well, simple and smooth it is.  It raises and lowers the lights in micro inches if you want. In this way you can raise them as the plants grow and it seems not to wear out at all with one season behind them.  I wish I had done this way before I retired.
Unlike some other reviewers, I find the build quality satisfactory. It is a little small for potted plants, however. When raised to the highest position, the lamp has a 26" clearance to the ground. The high-efficiency bulb generates a little less heat than standard fluorescent lights but is still hot enough to scorch leaves that come too close. In short, the maximum height for the plants is around 24", sufficient for a seed starter but way too low to serve as a mini-green house for plants that need to winter indoors.
I am very impressed with this unit!  I was able to start most of my seeds indoors this year and the ability to raise and lower the light easily to make sure you don't end up with spindly plants is great.  The light does not put out massive amounts of heat at all and is *incredibly* bright!  What amazing technology.  Highly recommend if you are a gardener who lives in an area with a short growing season.  The unit is extremely portable and lightweight.  It is also so simple to put together almost anyone could do it.  I prefer putting it on a table for easier access to plants and I also bought an inexpensive timer so I wouldn't have to remember to turn the unit on and off while working.  Great value.
This is very heavily built and well designed.  For a compact grill it reaches cooking temperature rapidly, and can hold 6 large burgers easily.  You can adjust the grill height to two positions. So far I've found the high position cooks best for my own style of cooking.  It's is easy to clean (set it on the grass and hose it out).  The bottom grating is showing signs of rust, so I've started using WD-40 on it after I rinse it out.  However, it is so stout that I don't know that the slight rust would cause a problem for some time.
This thing is awesome! Just big enough to cook for a small get together, but small enough to fire up for just two.  I currently have 8 different Weber Grill/Smokers - but I find I use this grill more than any of them.  A handful of lump charcoal and this baby is good for at least 4 hours.  Still learning different ways to cook with it, but this is much better than starting the range up in the hot summer.  TheLodge Logic 5-Quart Pre-Seasoned Dutch Ovenfits perfectly on top, and you could probably get two of them to fit without issue.It's also nice to place in the center of the table and everyone can cook their foods on it, then after cook marshmallows.  Food, Friends & Drink!  Life is good......
For starters, there are no instructions. Look at the pictures. There only two screws and they hold the body to the base...kind of. There's a door on the front, seems intuitive, but when you pick the grill up by the bail the grill tilts forward and the door flops open. Maybe I'm slow, but it took a good ten minutes to figure out what went where. Also this is a pre-seasoned grill and there are no directions as to use and preserve the coating.Edit: I just used it and could not dump the ashes. Even a cheap hibachi has wooden handles to grab. With this you have to heft it by the bail and tip it which isn't easy to do one-handed given the weight of this thing. I really want to love it, but, so far, we're not doing well.
After all, it IS cast iron.  It should last a lifetime.  It was very easy to put together, and we expect to use it for making kabobs on these warm summer days.  I think it took all of about 4 minutes to put it together.  There were no instructions and none were needed.We already have a charcoal grill, but sometimes you want just to cook enough for say two people and that's it, with no left overs.  This will do the job very nicely and not use a lot of charcoal.Oh, they recommend you place it on a concrete patio block to protect any surfaces underneath the grill.  The legs will get pretty hot, and the concrete block will absorb most of that, and not allow for any charring to take place under the unit.  You will need to have protective gloves on to handle the draft vents.
The Lodge Logic L410 Sportsman grill is wonderful. I received this as a Father's Day gift and put it to work. 28 briquettes and cooked 4 1/3Lb burgers and 4 jumbo hotdogs to perfection. 1" thick steaks cooked perfectly. Easy to assemble and clean.  Took a lightly oiled cloth to clean out any residual ash once it cooled. Stores nicely. I will mention it is heavy so be careful. It is cast iron and therefor weights a bit. Others have concerns about the tabs breaking off the door, but if you are moving it that much remove the door to move the grill.
I sure do love having this set in my shed.  I've used the blower extensively and the weed-whacker extensively.  I've never used the hedge trimmer, so I can't comment on that.Some perks..* it comes with two rechargeable batteries, which is super handy for heavy work days.  The battery charger also holds/chargers both batteries at the same time. Bonus.* Lightweight.  I never felt worn out carrying any of these around the lawn.* A wall mount with hooks comes with the set. So, I was able to hang these all neatly in my shed, just like in the photo.* Durable, good B&D; quality.The only bummer I've found with this set is that the leaf blower sucks the life out of the rechargeable batteries rather quickly.  So, don't dawdle when using the leaf blower.
I just wanted to add my voice to those who felt that the battery life was insufficient.  After moving into a new home and using this set to catch up on a significant amount of neglected landscaping, we just felt that it didn't cut it.  We were swapping out the battery every 40 minutes or so (the saving grace was that there were 3 of them, so there was always another one ready to go--so long as you were using one machine at a time).  Also, I felt that the hedge-clipper and the blower were fairly weak at their intended purposes.  The hedge trimmer kept stalling and getting caught on the hedges.  The blower blows grass around--do not even think about using it on leaves.  I cannot speak for the weedwacker, as I was disappointed enough to return the set without even bothering to test it.
The easiest way to go., March 10, 2008By  P. Stein "Bengals Fan" (Beavercreek, OH) - See all my reviewsI previously purchased all three items separately. The broom works great on my outdoor carpet, and is much easier to use than a wet dry vac. Easily blows away lawn clippings. The hedge saw is much easier to use than my electric hedge saw, though not as powerful. Fair tradeoff. The trimmer works fine. Preferable to either gas or electric, though obviously less powerful. Again, a fair tradeoff. If you have to stop and recharge it, no big deal. I received a promotional radio/charger free. I just keep the battery in the radio charger, and it's always ready to use. Great for when you use a portable radio all day. Recommend you try to add the radio to your arsenal. I'm glad I purchased these items. It made my life easier.
First of all, this is a light duty set of tools.  If you've got a large lawn and garden to take care of, I think you'll be happier with a corded approach to electrical tools.  But I've found this perfect for my needs.  Each battery is perfectly capable of powering the blower for five minutes or so, and since you have three batteries you can clear quite a large area.  The clipper and trimmer are top notch and seem to run forever on one battery.  The blower is about half as powerful as the best corded models, but it's adequate for blowing junk over hard surfaces.
I inherited a Felco hand pruner from a dear friend who could not do any gardening any more due to health issues.  I knew they had to be good otherwise she would not give me an old pair of pruners. And boy, are they great!She had these pruners for a number of years, and they are still sharp and cut like new! I haven't had to sharpen them. They feel comfortable in my small hand.  They operate very smoothly, they lock very smoothly, much nicer compared to the others pruners I've used.  And they work!  I can cut through some thick branches with ease, despite being a relative weakling.If I ever needed another pair (even though I doubt this one will break) I would definitely buy Felco Hand Pruner.
I haven't owned these long enough to know how they will stand the test of time, but they seem very well made, have a sharp blade, are comfortable, and have smooth action.  I like that you can swap out the blade after you've sharpened it too many times.  Mine came with a tiny tool that can be used to take apart the pruners, replace the blade, etc.  Seems like something that will be lost instantly.  Would have appreciated it if they had designed this to store on the pruner body somehow.  Also, the aluminum is roughed up a bit towards the tip of the pruner.  I am assuming this is part of manufacturing process but it looks more like someone drug it on the concrete or something.  The rest of the tool is finished nicely.
The most used garden tool is the pruners.  Cutting your plants back, you should make a clean cut as to not stunt their growth.  Again as things like small branches and trees grow you have to prune them back so this tool works great.  I work HVAC and always have a branch up my butt and love these to cut back plants around the condenser.  Buy it you'll love them.  As what people said about rust, these are make of steel and they do get a little rust but nothing big.  Stainless is a soft metal and would not work.
My mom owns a garden design and maintenance business.  I never really took interest in it until my wife and I purchased our first home.  As expected, we are now avid gardeners and landscapers.I really like Fiskars and had a set of them along with a cheap set from Target on hand.  My mom recommended that we step up to Felco Pruners.  She noted how she's had her set for over a decade and either takes them in for sharpening or orders new blades. They are built for life.I keep mine in my house with my nice knives.The motion is fluid and exact.  The cut is fine and thorough.  The ergonomics are spot-on.  I cannot find a weak point or complaint.  Be sure to buy the leather belt holster as well.Felco is a Swiss company that specializes in one thing for over 60 years - cutting tools.I wish I bought these sooner.
This is a high quality food grade DE and is labeled as such .  Believe it is the finest powder I have ever purchased and is rated the purest I have found .  My wife and I use it internally, plus I use it on the yard, under my home, garden and my large dog pens .  It works well in my Dustin Miser (sold on Amazon) , producing a very fine cloud of DE dust .  Because it is a very fine powder it coats things well and kills ticks, fleas, Colorado potato bug larva, most ants, and even most hard shell pests . People don't think DE will kill hard shell pests but even they have connecting membranes between the hard shell parts, and legs that can be damaged or cut . This product was shipped FAST and I highly recommend it and this seller to anyone .
I could not find food-grade diatomaceous earth anywhere locally. Most places had no idea what I was even talking about. I have a relative who lives in a low-income building that has repeatedly been infested with bed bugs. Although they have had professional pest control in several times, they always seem to survive. Tenants are forbidden to use any poisons due to their many tenants with health problems. This diatomaceous earth seems to have solved his problem in his apartment and he's now sharing the secret with his neighbors!This product was a good price; several dollars cheaper than similar products. Shipping was also more reasonable than others. And service was fast-it arrived in little over a week. I will buy from this seller again, should the need arise.
I purchased this to brew my batches of beer outside during the summer months (it gets too hot inside having a pot boil for so long..and my wife doesn't like the smell either). I was very pleased at the quality of construction and the ease of using this. After setting it up and testing for leaks using soapy water...I was ready to go.  As others have mentioned, the paint does burn off many places during its first use. I didn't buy this to look pretty...I want it to brew beer...and fast. And fast brewing it certainly does. After using it a few times, I feel more comfortable cranking it up to high. Definitely watch out as boil overs are much easier than on an inside burner. Overall though, I would estimate almost half an hour is saved by using this burner vs. the stove (I do partial mashes only). Good investment for any home brewer...and it can double as burner for frying turkeys!
[Update June 11, 2012: I'm still using the Bayou cooker several times a week]I bought this for two reasons:1) If it's hot out, I'd rather not heat up the house.2) I can't stand frying indoors.  I don't like the odors and I don't want oil/grease in the house.  We don't have a big outdoor vented hood in the kitchen.  Now I'm able to fry outdoors much of the year.It's a very simple unit.It's light-weight and very portable.  The propane tank weighs far more that the cooker.I use the cooker for wok cooking.  Although I have a very good gas kitchen stove, none of the burners give off nearly as much heat as this Bayou cooker.  At full blast, the Bayou cooker makes a whooshing sound like the gas units used in Chinese restaurants.The reason why I rated it 5 stars is price per performance.  I'm not comparing this unit to more expensive units.
I bought a stove top smoker a few years ago and although I do not use it everyday, I do tend to use it quite often. The problem is that I cannot find the fine wood chips at the regular stores like Wal-mart or Target. These store usually have the really large chips or blocks but not the fine dust like chips one needs for this type of smoker. I have looked at other online stores and found the chips but they were more expensive than at Amazon. What I also like is that this particular pack of chips has an assortment for using with various different meats such as for smoking fish, pork chops, etc. Also, since the smoker I have is a Cameron brand, this is perfect. I especially like the alder for Salmon.
I wish I'd ordered the 75-foot version since 25' isn't long enough! The cardboard label also says NOT APPROVED FOR SALE IN CALIFORNIA or something like that. So maybe the Hose Police will come and get me and drag me away. It's surprisingly lightweight and seems very flexible, then again it's brand new, and the 10-year old hoses this is replacing were supple, once, too. I can see ordering a second 25' length, since 25' is actually not enough to reach anywhere in my tiny yard.
There were forest fires around us last summer and I had a couple of these around.  I set them up to water out in the fields around us.  They worked so well that I bought 6 more just for this purpose.  As I am driving around my area; I see that I am not the only one who uses them.  They are sturdy, don't leak for the most part and the sprinkler head is of decent quality.  Unlike some other tripods, the sprinkler can be replaced with another if needed.  They will fall over if you have a decent windy day.  So, you should check on them occasionally.
I had used rockwool, but after reading some reviews thought I'd give these a try.They keep an even dampness better than rockwool. Rockwool can easily get drenched, but these seem to keep just the right amount of moisture.When I first got them I was surprised how much they looked like moist chocolate brownie cake. Even the spongy feel made me think &#34;This must be delicious&#34;. I never caved into that temptation, but to this day they still look and feel more appetizing than most brownies. I give a star for that alone.They also fit perfectly in the &#34;Hydrofarm CK64060 Hot House with Heat Mat,&#34; which is convenient.
I have had mine for 3 years now and love it. The assembly is minimal and the seasoning prcedure makes all the parts stay in great shape. I do a fair amount of smoking of meats (weekly) and it has been performing well. I have not modified it and manage the internal heat by using the right amount of charcoal and monitoring the unit every 20-30 minutes. Having worked with experienced Pit Masters, they all say the same thing. You have to pay attention to your fire, lift the lid as little as possible, monitor the temp, add more as needed. The only downside, true for all the water-smokers (hence 4 instead of 5) is adding can be challenging but not impossible. Patience is required. Would I buy it again, yes. Most of my smoking is done between 200-225F, and it does from ribs and whole turkeys very well. Even smoked a meatloaf! MMMMMMMMMM
This is a great hatchet that Paul would have liked to have had in his wood choppers tool box. There was a heavy storm in these parts fairly recently with very strong winds that knocked down many trees. Two of my neighbors trees fell into my yard and tore up my cedar fence. I also had my largest hardwood tree get blown over in my backyard where it fell without causing any damage. I sure wish Paul was available to help me out. Instead of Paul, this Fiskars hatchet came to the rescue in helping to clear up this big mess. Yes, I had to use a chainsaw as well when it came to cutting up the tree trunks. But the hatchet made short work of chopping up a lot of the branches. The hatchet has a nice heft and a comfortable grip. The blade stayed sharp far longer than I had anticipated. This is a must have tool to keep at hand. A great tool and a great price...
I have really come to love the Fiskars tools.  I bought a post hole digger which is head and shoulders better than everything else, and this hatchet is the same way.  It is different than others in many ways.  It looks different and honestly a bit fragile. However it is one tough mother.  The lightweight handle gives you more head speed, which translates into deeper cuts per chop.  The angle of the blade and the non-stick coating really slices through wood.  The way the blade is attached provides no place for the head to bind up in the wood which again allows you to cut deeper.  I am buying one of the axes in this line too.  Awesome tool.
I started buying Fiskars products for my floral business.The small pruners were exactly what I needed for delicate flowers.I was impressed by how easy they were to handle & super sharp.Next was to buy larger  pruners,then moved to gardening Fiskars etc. Just loved the sharpness and design.We recently bought a wood stove for our stand alone cabin/guest house& my husband needed more wood split than the usual fireplace wood.I got the axe,then he had to cut some &#34;splinters&#34; for starting the woodstove.This axe perfectly fits the bill ! .It is lightweight,extremely sharp,easy to maneuver,and once again,Fiskars,still made in Sweden(maybe Finland)produces far superior results.Top quality,lifetime guarantee,great addition.Can't find a fault,including a very fair price.
You will not be disappointed with any Fiskars product, and no, I do not work for the company. Wish I did. All the Fiskars axes adn hatchets are wonderful. I went a little crazy a few months ago and ordered about one of every size axe/hatchet that Fiskars make and I love each one equally. The handle, the look, the design, the price. This is a top of the line product. Anything else other than a a Fiskars is a waste of your time and money. Ohhh, Just had a thought....I did buy the Fiskars sharpening tool as well. The Fiskars sharpening tool is a piece of junk. It broke when I tried to use it the first time and I was completely unimpressed, but I did not return it to the vendor, too much hassle. The axes/hatchets are GREAT though and you will love them.
I at first was disappointed with the item when I pulled it out of the box as it is VERY light. But don't let that fool you: this trowel is very strong and perfect for loosing up weeds (in between flagstone or in gravel), mild digging (2-4&#34; rocks) and full potting. I am going to buy another for my Grandma as this item is so light it will be perfect for her. I imagine it cannot handle excessive force, but given it's weight it is pound-for-pound as strong if not stronger than a metal or other material counterpart. PLUS it can't rust, which is great for me since I live near the ocean.
Seems like every other week or so it randomly drops to 84 cents as an add on item. You simply cannot beat that price. I got several for my son and his friends to play with in the dirt and some for the front and back yard. It is a ridged plastic but dug fine in hard dirt for me. Don't go prying up rocks or it might break but for general digging it is just fine. But you can abuse it all you want and if it does break you are out less than $1.
While not as strong as a trowel made of metal, Fiskars 7978 Composite Trowel is still strong enough to handle basic gardening tasks.  Made out of a composite plastic called `FiberComp', the tool is very lightweight.  The blade is oversized, quite wide, and appears to be quite sturdy.  The rock solid handle is probably the strongest part of the tool, and snapping the blade off would take a great deal of force.  The handle has a spot on the top for your thumb, and a slot at the end for hanging.This tool will not corrode, and if not abused, it should last for a long while.  The price at Amazon is a little steep, so may want to check your local hardware store for a better deal.
Fiskars 7977 Composite Cultivator is certainly not as strong as a similar cultivator made of metal, but it's stronger than you might expect, and is a tool that is well-suited for light duty gardening.  Made out of a very stiff composite plastic called `FiberComp', tool is very lightweight.  The handle is rock solid, and while much thinner, the tines are surprisingly hard as well.  While this tool is most useful in soil that contains some moisture and is somewhat soft, it is capable of more rugged performance.  The handle has a spot on the top for your thumb, and a slot at the end for hanging.This tool will not corrode, and if used properly and not abused, it should last for some time.  The price at Amazon is a little steep, so may want to check your local hardware store for a better deal.
I get no joy out of killing them, but the voles have driven me to this. Nothing has worked, not the castor oil, the bleach, the ammonia, the commercial pest deterrents,  or the dish detergent. This week I set up traps, some the old fashioned wooden types and one of these Snap-E traps.I've only caught one vole; it was with the Snap-E within hours of setting it. Set up is simple, no tricky bar to set. Filled the bait cylinder with peanut butter and pulled back the metal bar until it clicked into place. Removing the dead vole was easy too. Wearing gloves I lifted up the bar so the vole could drop to the ground. I buried it right there.It's an unpleasant business, but the Snap-E trap is efficient and effective.Update - I've caught two more voles with this same trap. Removing the vole is so much better with this trap than with the wooden one.
But not mine. It has managed to set off one of 3 I have set up, but it avoided getting caught, just as it has for 3 wooden d-Con traps. When I got these I was very optimistic because the bait is actually hidden and the mouse would have to investigate the smell and put its hand on the trap releases to get a better look at the food. Nothing seems to trick this mouse. I don't know what to do. It's been 2 weeks since I set up these traps.Does anyone have any food suggestions to bait with? I've tried peanut butter, walnuts and ranch dressing.
I have an old mallow bush that has had a white fly infestation every year beginning in the spring and running into November.  It is the only place in my yard where whiteflies have been a problem. Because the honey bees love the mallow flowers, I have not wanted to use a systemic or spray with harsh chemicals so the white flies have been right at home there for ten years or so.  In early March this year I placed about a half bag of earthworm castings on the ground under the mallow, spreading them several feet on all sides of the bush.  To my delight and surprise - no white flies on the mallow or surrounding area this year. They've moved away from my yard.  The honey bees are not at all turned off by the castings and continue to enjoy the flowers.  Now that I've seen how well they work, I will never again be without a supply of earthworm castings.  I can't believe I didn't know about their benefits earlier in my gardening adventures.
We've been inundated by squirrels raiding (taking over) our platform birdfeeder that came with our country home.  After extensive searching and reading of consumer reviews, we decided on the Heritage Farms bird feeder.  It looked extremely durable and it holds a lot of seed.  The perches are weight adjustable so you can exclude blue jays or pigeons from eating the seed if you want.  I had the feeder set up in no time and it took about 1 hour before the first bird lighted on it and started eating.  Soon, the word was out and several birds were enjoying the seed.  We look forward to many years of enjoyment - it's built like a 50's metal toy truck, if you're old enough to remember!!
This has been my best 'Squirrel Proof' Feeder to date and I now have six various kinds of feeders meant to keep out the 'grey hoards'.  When filled with mixed seed it also attracts the greatest variety of birds of any feeder I own, particularly Eastern Cardinals. Is VERY heavy when fully loaded and I found that hanging it is more secure than using the included pole. You MUST use a long and sturdy hanger to keep squirrels from hanging onto a branch or tree trunk and bypassing the weight triggered closing mechanism. Will keep out at least 90% of your Squirrels which usually content themselves to forage on seeds dropping to the ground below the feeder.
I purchased one of these last year and used it this spring for tomato and pepper seedlings.  The ease of use and amount of light provided by this item was amazing compared to an old plant light I'd purchased many years ago.I just ordered a second one and will give my old light to a friend.Since I had a lot of seedlings, I draped a mylar sheet over the entire thing and it reflected the light wonderfully.I really like how easy it is to adjust the height.  My old light only has 3 static levels and you have to maneuver the entire light fixture on the arms from one setting to another.I've already purchased 4 bulbs and expect the two lights to serve me for many years to come.
I had always just used a regular lamp and a south facing window. And only had limited and some what pathetic results despite years of trying. I finally decided to stop messing around. Put this on my Amazon Wish List for Christmas and was happy to get it. Combined with a seedling heat mat under my seedlings I am seeing faster and healthier growth in all of the seeds I planted. Many of those only sprout in full sun, and I do not think any of them would have come up without this lamp. Very excited, and have just ordered another one!
This a very good tool and cuts very nicely. I agree that it does a nice job cutting, however, I give it 4 stars because the handles are a bit weak looking and flex easily when trying to cut live branches that approach 3 inches, and I am afraid I will snap the handle if I put too much pressure. That happens when the handles are fully extended or not...so 4 stars. With that said, it works as advertised. It can be locked closed. Be careful and it should get the job done relatively easily. I just wish the handles were sturdier.
The Perky Pet 203 CP is difficult to fill and clean since the only opening is the diameter of a soft drink bottle.  Perky Pet makes other models which open on both ends allowing you to clean and fill the glass jar though the larger end.  That means that you can use a soapy paper towel (rinse well afterwards with hot water to remove all traces of soap), to clean the bottle rather than having to purchase and use a narrow bottle washer brush.  This model also lacks and included hook for hanging.I have and far prefer the Perky PetPerky-Pet 130TF 8-Ounce Glass Top Fill Hummingbird Feederwhich has not of the above shortcomings and is a easy to fill and clean.  It comes with a small "S-Hook" for hanging, too.
I have had several feeders that leak or the hummers don't like it including the Aspects 153 & 367 models.  I admit the Aspect model are easier to clean but if the birds don't care for it...  I live in Florida where hummers at my location are not large as in Texas and Cal.  So the size is better for refilling here.  Bees are not a problem here  and the yellow bee guards do not draw them to the feeder.  In fact, I cut small hole in the guards so the hummers could feed easier and also I liked the contrast of yellow because I could have taken them off completely. As for the color you could paint them with hobby shop paint or just nail polish.  Anyhow, I like it and the birds like it what else do you need.
I hadn't put out a feeder for several years, but a little green hummer kept bopping over the the patio this past week whenever I was outside.  He'd hover and dart around the chimes and lights, making it obvious that he was looking for a feeder.So ... I ordered two of these because I wanted some that were small, affordable and had a bee guard.Thanks to Amazon, they arrived very fast and my little hummingbird has already found it.He's happy and I'm no longer feeling guilty.These are easy to fill and just the size I wanted.
This is a good Hummingbird feeder, but once you start feeding Hummingbirds, this is way tosmall.Once the  Hummingbirds started coming to the feeder, I had to refill this at least 3 times aday.I then bought the BIG large feeder, and had to fill it everyday.Please do NOT buy the colored hummingbird food. The Red Dye is Unhealthy-poison to the Hummingbirds.The red yellow feeder and sugar attracts the hummingbirds not the red dye.Your can mix your own hummingbird food using :1 cup white sugar, too , 2 Cups hot, or warm water to melt the sugar.Stir very good till all the sugar is melted.. It should be a bit thick.Do not give it to the birds till it cools down.Do not be discouraged if it takes a few weeks before the hummingbirds find your feeder.I could only give this a 3 star for the small size.
The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However, it makes it pretty heavy, so if you are using a window hanger, make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily, backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share, but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days, but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though.
I purchased one of these feeders in the spring, along with one or two others of different design.  It didn't take long for this to win the popularity contest.  Before we knew it, this feeder was the object of pitched hummingbird battles, while the other feeders were virtually ignored.  We quickly picked up two more of the Perky Pet (what an awful name) feeders and now we have more hummers than we've had in years.  Around here, it's mainly Blackchin and Rufous, but perhaps some others will notice the crowd.The smaller capacity is an advantage.  There's less chance of solution going bad, and the glass is easy to clean.  We're finding that the feeders need to be replenished about every two days, so there's little chance of gumming up.  A little pricier than some feeders to be sure, but the birds sure like them.
We've had this feeder for a year and have had good success attracting hummingbirds with it. The bright red color apparently does a good job luring them to our window. It's a little inconvenient to clean but I don't mind because my wife does it.We have it hanging on a hanging device attached to a deck rail in front of a window. The only problem with this set up is that I can barely see the hummingbirds who invariable decide to perch on the opposite side of the feeder.Watching the hummingbirds is a joy. It might be a good idea to add a water baffle to the top to discourage ants. It really works.
The old glass Perky Pet nectar feeder that still have is from the late 1980's or early 1990's.Hope this new &#34;Perky Pet Glass Nectar Feeder&#34; will last as long as that old feeder is lasting!With the construction being very similar i think it might. Differences being:new style has perches & new style has a threaded top & plastic cap where the old style did not have perches & it has a rubber cap & a grove in the top of bottle for a wire to hold the cap onto the bottle.The bee guards on the new feeder really do keep the bees out.If Looking for a glass nectar feeder that the hummers would like;this one by Perky Pet would be an excellent choice!
Buzz, my Anna's male hummer who has claimed my yard and this feederas his own, seems to like this feeder.  I have two now, I rotate them each weekas I clean, refresh them.  They are a bit hard to clean, I use a toothbrush to cleanthe feeder part.  The newer one is a bit different than the one I got a couple years ago,the perches don't seem as good, seem a bit short, but, it works so far.  Price is rightanyway, especially if you only have one or two hummers that use it.
Purchased 4 of these feeders and one of them leaked profusly right away. Sent it back and Amazon replaced it with another one that also leaked. Since then, the other three started leaking also. Don't know if I can still return the entire batch since it has been a couple of months, but I am going to try. I had these same feeders in the past and they lasted several years. Somebody "improved" them.Update: I contacted the manufacturer direct since the Amazon return policy is only good for 30 days and they replaced all four feeders with no hassel whatsoever. Havn't received them yet, so I don't know how these will perform.
I swapped out my old plastic hummingbird feeders for this glass one because the plastic ones kept getting moldy and were so hard to clean properly. This one is the perfect size to hold 2 cups of homemade sugar syrup, which the birds love. It took a good few days to a week before the birds would use this feeder. I don't think they like the perches, as they loved my old feeders which didn't have perches. They don't seem to feed for as long on this feeder as my old feeders either. I also think they preferred my old feeders because they had the raised yellow flowers, this feeder has flat flowers which doesn't seem to attract them as much.
This feeder is very easy to clean and to fill.  Lots of feeding stations.  There are perches all around, and the hummingbirds appreciate this.  Since there is no container above the feeding stations, you can see the birds from all angles, a big plus.  This would be a 5 star product if the design was modified a bit.  If the feeder was a bit smaller in circumference and a little deeper, it could still hold 16 ounces of nectar with slower evaporation and a little more stability when hanging.  This is a good, functional feeder that's reasonably priced.
This thing is great! If I remember, I'll upload some pics. Totally easy to clean. the clear bottom and red top separate and its just a big space to easily wipe out - no nooks or crannies to worry about. Everything seems pretty solid and sturdy, and it is a bit bigger than I thought it'd be, which is not a bad thing. The only negative is that the brass hook is too small to fit on my standard iron shepherd's hook - I think someone else mentioned this too. No big problem though - I am just using one of those big plant s-hooks for now, and later I'll get a smaller one (so it doesn't hang quite so low). Other than that easily fixed issue, it's great! Bought this to replace a standard 'Best 1' feeder.
When filled this is a very heavy bird feeder so be prepared with a steel hook on a post. I doubt that your going to be able to tree limb mount this due to its weight combined with the narrow space between the roof finial and the underside of the handle. But it is a lovely, well constructed, metal bird feeder with a weight sensitive perch. The squirrels can still eat anything that falls on the ground but between the slippery metal and that perch they won't be stealing from inside. And the lid comes off easily while still being able to fill and secure. The bright red color means you can easily spot it outside. This holds a couple pounds of bird seed.
An extremely well constructed feeder, easy for owner to fill, but so far impossible for squirrels to get to the seed. Owing in part I'm sure because of the squirrels ability to get into (either opening or chewing through) other feeders they are very large and do not tolerate well inability to get to the seed they want. The solid steel construction and effective protection of clear plastic windows have made this one of only three feeders on our property the squirrels and/or raccoons have not been able to break into. The simple, wide opening (but securely fastening) access on the top of the feeder make it extremely easy to fill the cavernous feeder. My 91 year old Father-in-law spends a great deal of time at his dining room table reading and looking out his rear window at this feeder and he loves watching the squirrels trying unsuccessfully to get into the feeder! Strongly recommend this feeder for anyone plagued by squirrels raiding their bird feeders. christina & bogie
There are many things you notice right off on this feeder.  It is all metal, very attractive and built very well.I am impressed!!I loaded it up with bird seed and within 2 days the birds adjusted to it and actively feeding.  As you can see by the picture there are clever designed "windows" so you can easily see the amount of remaining seed.Included is the heavy hangar and again clever designed mounting system with screws so you have options on how and where you place it.  I do have it mounted under cover, but it appears to be water proof with its tin roof and painted body. I wouldn't hesitate to put it out in the rain.This would make a great gift for yourself or for someone else.
I can't complain about the squirrels because I put out peanuts and corn for them so I am inviting them into the yard. But they seem content to eat corn and peanuts. They don't bother my other feeders. They are like little monkeys in the yard. I like to watch the squirrels. However this feeder still seemed like a good idea.I have had it up for a few weeks. I have black oil sunflower seeds in it. The birds hit it regularly.It looks great and seems quite durable. I have mine hung from a garden hook.
I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected, but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof, which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make, but it is a neat feature. Overall, I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it.
I love my wild animals, especially birds!  I have several bird feeders and love to attract as many birds and variety of birds as possible.  My one or two problems are squirrels and big black birds.  I was thrilled to see this adorable Perky-Pet Squirrel-Be-Gone Bird Feeder. It is just so cute...just like a little red barn with a weather vane on top.  It is also very well constructed.  It is working great at keeping the squirrels out of the bird feed.  My squirrels can empty a feeder in just a little bit, but not this one.  I love watching them try and try to get food out of it.  I don't want to hurt the squirrels as my husband suggested using a BB Gun on them so I am just so happy that they will not be harmed, but also can't clean out the feeders.  5 stars!
This feeder will most certainly light up any back or front yard, it is THAT pretty.  The paint is a solid and thick laquer, and I like the metal perching bar instead of wooden dowels which can get chewed away by annoyed squirrels over time.  The feeder has a large solid hanger and also comes with pole mount.The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is the filling access.  This feeder top loads, and in order to open the roof piece one must turn the squirrel weather vane.  Opening the roof is easy, but closing it again requires some finesse and delicate realigning of the inside lock.  One needs to be able to look inside to get it realigned, so mounting the feeder on a high pole as we like to do is out of the question.  If the company can figure out an easier way to lock the roof this will be a solid five star feeder.
The Perky-Pet 338 Squirrel Be Gone II Country House is cute.But it's flimsier than it looks from the photos. The construction is thin sheet metal, with sharp edges.I don't know why there are so many positive reviews. It's a less effective feeder than cheaper options (i.e., the birds don't like it -- at least our birds in the midatlantic), and my squirrels have been able to get out the seed. Meanwhile, the seed has a tendency to get stuck with the awkward portals and under the levers.The feeder can be hung from the metal hanger (which is shown in the photos), or it has a large shaft through the middle, so you can stick it on a pole.The weathervane also serves as the latch to open the top, but it's also poorly engineered.
Squirrels seem to give up very quickly on this feeder, as their weight closes off access to the feeder tray.  While that is a great, money-saving aspect of the feeder, and I really like the large size (fewer refills) and level-check windows, the downside of this type of feeder is that it limits visits from beautiful larger birds (woodpeckers, cardinals, blue jays, etc.  Finches, sparrows, and wrens seems to only visitors due to the small landing area it offers.
It is nicely constructed. It is made of metal, so it will hold up. The perch is weight triggered so larger animals like squirrels will lower the perch and block the food. You can also adjust it dependent on the size of the birds in the area. You can adjust it for larger or smaller birds. It is larger than I expected and will hold plenty of food. If you twist the Weathervane, it will unlock the the panel on the top for easy access for refilling. It also comes with an attachment (including fasteners) that you can place on a stand and you can place the feeder on the stand, easy to place and remove from stand. Over all this is a nice feeder.
This is a good sized feeder and it looks good in the yard.  It seems to be a favorite for the smaller birds.  I've had it in the yard for a couple of weeks now and the squirrels have so far ignored it.  Be careful when you are handling this feeder because the edges on it are very very sharp so use care when taking it out of the box.Updated review several months later:  The feeder has been out in the yard for several months now and it still looks good.  However, the squirrels have now discovered that can climb onto the top of the feeder, unscrew the latch, push it off and then they climb inside and have a picnic.  So I will have to come up with a way to make it so that they cannot unscrew the latch.
Said to be drinking safe, this cute little 4 ft hose is perfect for me as a split-off from the main faucet where I have the big hose. On a hot day I like to drink the really cold well water which comes out after garden-watering. The connections are tight. I always put a bit of Vaseline on washers at the beginning of the season, OR replace them with new rubber ones. I do this on sprayers as well. Maybe that's why I had no leakage problems.
This is a good quality water hose that is safe to drink from.I keep a bowl of water outside my workshop door so the dogs can drink whilst they are out with me. I was always wary that water sat in the regular garden hose could have leeched chemicals, and I would be tainting the water of my four legged friends. I now use this hose instead.  Piece of mind, for just a few bucks.Some reviewers appear to have been shipped hoses without the rubber washer. If you dont use a washer, then it will leak. Mine came with the washer and does not leak. The washers wear out over time and need replacing, I keep these on hand:Gilmour 01RW Rubber Hose Washers
I have a spout in my garage that sits about two feet off the floor. So I needed a short length hose to use for filling up buckets, watering can, etc. This fit the bill perfectly. Install was a breeze and it is well made, so it should last for a long time. The only draw back for me was that the hose is way to stiff. It sits in a curled up position and always retains back to that position no matter what I try to do to remedy it. Overall not a deal breaker for me as it has exceeded my expectations.
Bought two of these to try to deal with mosquitos that sneak into the house.  Have caught quite a few small flies and gnats, too.  Ordered an extra pack of glue strips.  Be careful to slide the strip in properly and it will be catching flying pests right away.Nice that these are for inside use but an on/off switch would be a good addition.  To turn off, you have to take out of wall socket.  Since the light is pretty bright, I only put them on at night when we leave the rooms or if we are going to be gone for most of the day.A variation that might also work would be a model that could be plugged in but then attached higher up on a wall where the glare of the light would not be in human sight all the time.  Like the large units you see in commercial buildings but scaled down for residential use.
I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!
This Fly Web Fly Trap is actually much larger than expected and did work somewhat to help control my fruit fly infestation. We tried three products side by out of desperation and here are the results after 48 hours:Terro 2500 Fruit Fly Trap; used as directed, caught 2 fruit fliesFly Web Fly Trap; large plug in light based trap with sticky pads, caught 11 fruit fliesFly Paper Strips, Fly Catcher Trap, Victor Fly Bait 4 Pack; the old standby, not attractive but effective, caught at least 32 (perhaps more)The Fly Web product performed right in the middle of the other two products we tried, but no telling how many it would have caught if it was the only product we used at that time. It also only comes with one sticky pad (which turned out not be an issue since the card was far from full), but refills are availableFly Web Glue Board 10 Pack.We are sticking (mild pun intended) with the Fly Paper Strips going forward.CFH
I have tried and tried to fild a product that would get rid of those pesky knats!! and fruit flies around the house, and I must say I HIGHLY recommend this product, and is the only thing that has worked well thus far. I keep this running day and night and you would not believe the amount of knats and fruit flies this thing catches!! You better buy more sticky pads, because this thing will sure get filled up quickly. This product receives an easy 5 star rating form me.
Some seasons, I get a lot of small flying insects in the house, mainly because I like to operate my whole house fan.  The main offenders are gnats and small mosquitos that get through the bug screen on my windows.  This unit is great because no matter how small, these bugs will stick to the glue strip.  I bought a spare bulb and spare glue sheets jsut to have them on hand.My only wish is that the unit would add a power switch.  I only operate it at night (makes a good night light in the hallway!) and must physically unplug it and set it down to turn it off.  Either that or a darkness-sensing switch.
This is the replacement glue boards for the absolutely awesomeFly Web Fly TrapThese glue boards are very sticky with a small strip on the edge where there is no glue. Easily slides in/out of the Fly Web Fly Trap. These glue boards get so packed with flying and even crawling critters that the card is hardly white! Inexpensive yet very effective when used with the light. Once they are on the glue board they are stuck, period._Bottom Line_ Yes, I would recommend this with the Fly Web Fly Trap to let the glue board and light do the work for you! Easily throw away the critters instead of wiping up splats!
These Fly Web Glue Boards work as well as the single included glue board that comes with theFly Web Fly Trap. To be clear, this is not a standalone product, they are designed to be used in the "Fly Web Fly Trap".The Glue Boards have a protective sheet that needs to be removed before they inserted in the dedicated slot of the main unit. This is easy to do and it works reasonably well.We did a comparison of the "Fly Web Fly Trap" verses theTerro 2500 Fruit Fly TrapandFly Paper Strips, Fly Catcher Trap, Victor Fly Bait 4 Pack, with the old fashion but very ugly Flay Paper Strips winning hands down.Recommended, if you own theFly Web Fly TrapCFH
I feed birds all winter and the sparrows, cardinals, finches, etc. - all come to eat.  In past years water that wasn't ice was the one thing they needed to sustain them.  I bought this to use in a birdbath so that my birds could drink, as well as, eat all winter.  It's very economical to use and the birds think it's just a rock at the bottom of the bird bath.  I'm very pleased with this item.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in keeping our &#34;feathered friends&#34; going over the winter.
Bought this in the summer (much cheaper then) and put it out about 2 months ago.  We have our own "homemade" fountain which consists of a large pot that holds about 10 gallons of water and a shallow dish on top.This product is able to keep the water liquid, combined with the moving water from the fountain.  Night time temps have averaging about 15 F.  The birds have been flocking to it.The cord is very, very short, about a foot long.  That is one drawback because you will need an outdoor extension cord. It is sturdy and does not get too warm.  You can easily pick it up with your bare hands when it is running.Did not notice the impact on the electric bill.
this is well built and serves it's purpose functionally.my complaint is that the hole inside the shutoff valve/bearing is considerably smaller than the width of the hose connection.  when putting this on, you are basically blocking off around half of the capacity of whatever is after it in the chain.i use it at the end of my hose, right before my gilmour quick connects, so that when i change out my sprinklers and nozzles, i don't have to walk across the yard to turn off the hose so that i don't get sprayed (so lazy).  it works fine, and i haven't seen any real loss of range with the water, but i think the change would be noticeable if i put another hose after this connector.
I have these Gilmour connectors all around the house, and I love them.  They are practically indestructable, and exceeds my expectations.  I have them hooked up to hoses, bypassing our water softener.  I also use the double connectorsGilmour 13 Brass 2-Way Connectoras well, which are equally as good.  A must have for every home.I recommend using this with a small piece of teflon to prevent corrosion at the connectors.  If corrosion does take place, it can become very difficult to unscrew it.
I wanted a heating pad so I figured I'd get the whole kit.  This kit is a bit disappointing because the plastic dome does not fit well on the base so there is an air gap.  I have this sitting on a wooden floor and the heater has worked fine.  I just think it was very overpriced for what I got.  The plastic parts are thin and would require me to be careful if I want to use them for years to come.  I had hoped for better.
I placed seeds into a miracle grow potting mix, watered, then covered up the dome and in 3 days every one of the 12 species had sprouted to about an inch tall (or more in the case of fast growing sunflowers).Echinacea, red lettuce, romaine lettuce, snap peas, orange sunflower, red sunflower, chives, 4 different heirloom tomatoes, and dill - all of them are growing like weeds.  As soon as they're big enough for transplanting, I'll be using it again to sprout another 12 or so species for the spring garden.The moisture level is pretty constant after te first and only watering 10 days ago, since you can keep the dome mostly shut (or open it up if that's too wet).My only complaint is that the dome dribbles water when you move it since the set is designed with the clear plastic dome on top/over the edge.  But, that was nothing a tea towel under the seed bed doesn't fix.  For the price, I really couldn't be happier!
This simple and inexpensive pad has been WONDERFUL.  The difference it makes in sprouting my seeds is incredible.  At first, I cautiously placed the pad and greenhouse on a table, fussing over it. Now, its on the tile floor (with a towel underneath to keep the cold ceramic tile from leaching too much heat) and works well without notice.It comes with a plastic egg-carton like tray to start your own seeds with your own soil.  However, I'm lazy.  I just put one of those square trays with the soil pellets in them ($5 from the hardware store) to start my seeds instead; fits and works perfectly.I will not be without this ever.  Temperature is great.  Keeps a consistent warmth into the soil.STRONGLY RECOMMEND.
This Hydrofarm hothouse with heat mat is a simple and effective way to start your plants from seed. The heat mat in particular will last you years and years most likely. The hothouse itself is of questionable manufacture, being a flimsy plastic, but it does what it is supposed to perfectly. There is a vent on top and one to either side of it as well to help control the temp and humidity if you dont use a guage. The 72 seed cells are likewise nothing special, but are again, quite effective. I have placed a variety of seeds in this, from tomatoes, to peppers to quinoa to tobacco, and everything tends to spout within 4 to 7 days. Anyways, even though of flimsy manufacture, the price is right and the goods are effective, so i give this 4 stars accordingly. Just be gentle with it, and if necessary, save the mat in the event that you damage the hothouse.Enjoy!
Very happy with the product.  The heat is consistent and I love the ability to adjust airflow.  The only suggestion and reason for 4 starts instead of five is that condensation tends to drip out.  The plastic could have been moulded with the lip turned up and drain ridges put in which would have kept the condensation in.  It doesn't pour out or anything but I've had to put a piece of cardboard and a garbage bag under the unit to prevent it from ruining my table.  Also happy with Amazon shipping to Japan for me since, even with shipping, it's cheaper than what is available here.  Will definitely be ordering more Hydrofarm products in the future.
When I first opened the package, I was disappointed.  This cover and box is about the same thickness & quality as a jiffy mini-greenhouse that you could pick up for less than 10 bucks.  If you're expecting a heavy duty piece, this isn't for you.  It seems to do the job though.  The little side and top vents are the same quality as the rest, so don't expect anything mind-blowing.  On the positive side they seem to do a pretty good job controlling humidity.  I have them just a crack open to keep things nice and moist and the heating pad is generating enough heat to fog up the cover.  As long as it doesn't fall over and get stepped on, I am sure I'll be happy.  One misstep though and this thing is going to crack and be ready for the trash bin.  I WOULD buy this again, although I'd be much happier if it were 15 bucks.
This Orbit 62001 Lawn and Garden Digital Watering Timer is handy for automatic watering of trees and shrubs. It operates on two 9-volt batteries. It consists of a motor-operated valve and a timer.  The user attaches the female coupling of the valve to a hose bib and the male coupling to a garden hose or drip irrigation pipe.  The timer can be removed from the assembly for easy programming.  There are four watering cycles per day; it can be programmed to run seven days or any day(s) of the week, or every 2nd day or 3rd day. The timer can also be turned on manually.  However, each cycle or manual operation lasts only up to 6 hours.  I found it inadequate because I use the timer for drip irrigation, which by its nature can last a lot more than 6 hours.  Other than the short duration, this Orbit timer runs well.
I have owned this little unit for over a year and it works great.  Why? It is hard for birds to judge the depth of the water when it is not moving so they may pass over your bath thinking that it is too deep.  (this may sound silly to us, but it is true).  I get 2-3 times more birdbath activity now.  You still have to clean your water and I remove the Wiggler before winter.  The batteries last many months.  Honestly, the price is a little steep for what it is, but it is worth it for what it does - attracts more birds.  It should last many seasons with proper care.
Fiskars is a respected brand and I'd buy from them again, just not this particular pruner. The sliding lock mechanism is easy to operate and the pruners have a good spring to them.When I first got this pruner, it worked great. The cuts were clean and straight. After about three weekends of pruning (mostly rose bushes), the blades started dulling and no longer cut cleanly every time. Softer plant parts like dahlias flower stalks get squished and caught between the blades, causing them to stick together and not spring back open. This can leave a messy cut with jagged ends of plant tissue and cambium exposed, especially with stems that have soft, fibrous outer layers of bark, like green rose branches. For woodier cuts like camellia, it is still fine.Sometimes holding the pruners upside-down from the orientation pictured in the product photo helps deliver a clean cut. So, I rate this pair of pruners only average, because it has the same problem as my previous pruner with squishing stems.
If you have rose bushes, the Fiskars Pruner is a must have. I love fresh roses in the house but hate those pesky thorns and always had a heck of a time removing them. With the Fiskars Pruner, I was able to remove all thorns rather quickly (it only took one or two times to get it down) and found the pruners to fit really well in my hand, eliminating any hand discomfort.  The blade is sharp and shows no sign of rust after using them for a season. This is a really useful tool and I absolutely would recommend others to purchase!
Purchased this snow removal tool for my wife, who uses her car on a daily basis for work.  While the car trunk is already filled with an assortment of semi-helpful gadgets, assuring her safety on the road, the Sno Brum is unquestionably in the top 5.  The tool is simple, effective, and does &#8220;what it says it does&#8221; easily. The tool doesn&#8217;t scratch the car body, is lightweight, and yet durable.  Don&#8217;t hit the snowy roads this winter without it!  All the more in Connecticut, a state in which a regulation will go into effect whereby cars may be fined up to $1000 for excess snow and ice flying off.
This is as good as advertised for a car and I've used it for that and will keep it in the car.  But for me the good news is the threads in the snow brum head and handle are the same as with household poles for extending roller brushes or attaching mops.  I really wanted the snow brum to clear the snow off a large hot tub cover and was able to quickly attach the heat to a 10' extension pole.  The handle that comes with it won't quite reach all the way across the cover.
This feeder works so well, I brought a second.  I have alot of squirrels and most have given up.  I must confess a couple have leaped from the pole to the perch, but it closed and they gave up. They try to come off the top and try to chew on it, since it have a metal top, again they given up or fall off trying to stretch to the feeder opening.  This feeder is about squirrel free as possible.  I have loads of cardinals, finches,titmouse, woodpecker and no problems landing on it. It is expensive, I have seen ones in Wildbirds Unlimited for $100.  Worth the money.
The best squirrel proof feeder out!  We purchase our first one in 2007 and recently the perches came loose and we lost them - a simple call and email to the company brought us a new set in just a few days.  Great support!  Feeder is easy to load and easy to use and works great.  When we lost the perches we purchased a new one and then got the parts for the old one - now we use two and they are wonderful - expensive but well built, last a long time and company stands behind them.  Worth every penny!
As a Christmas gift to a friend, I am helping her feed the birds.  She is confined to a wheelchair so watching the birds gives her and her cats a lot of pleasure.  We wanted to draw an assortment of birds, not just sparrows.  This feeder is drawing tit mice, gold finches and a few cardinals but not sparrows.  The squirrels have continued to be thwarted by it and it holds enough feed that I think I can fill it once a week.  We are very pleased with it!
The birds don't like it at all....I saw about four just sit at the feeder and try to figure out what they were supposed to do.  I think one of the birds actually flipped me off for getting this.  If you don't tighten the lid and bottom secure enough the bird seed will spill ALL over your floor, and it's amazing how quickly a full bird feeder will empty on the ground.  I would have to say that I can't see how a squirrel would get to the food...I will say that about it.  But what good is it if the birds don't get to it either?  I'll probably go back to one of the others and just feed the squirrels with the birds.
Pricey yes but you get what you pay for. This is my third feeder but this one is the best made bar none. It was already assembled but with very well written instructions on taking it apart and cleaning. It is VERY big/long and holds a ton of feed which is good and easy to fill. The top locks nicely too so critters cannot get the feed. The cardinal ring is awesome and within 2 hours many cardinals learned how to feed on the unit. Other feeders no where near match this quality and design.
This feeder I do really like. It helps me fight my squirrel problem &#34; but I do have some smart squirrels&#34;  a few have figured out ways to work around it but it is difficult and they don't stay very long. So it does work  and I like it.For any one who also has a raccoon problem you may want to try this one .  I know you told me up front in your detail about this feeder it was squirrel proof not raccoon proof .  But we were having a raccoon problem and this one he can't get off the pole and put on the ground or get the top off.  But you must be sure to close the top securely and tight.  I have two of these feeders now and the raccoon has stopped for now.
Pricey? Yes, but well worth it!!  I have purchased many bird feeders over the years (including Duncraft) but this feeder is the Rolls Royce in design, construction, durability and ease of use (filling, hanging).  Squirrels have eaten the last of my birdseed - this one will definitely keep them out - so ingenious!  I also purchased the weatherguard to protect the birds, as well as the seed, from the elements. I am sooooo impressed with this feeder - I hope the birds like it as much as I do!  (ha-ha)The weatherguard was a little tricky to install but if I can do it, anyone can!  Just follow the instructions that come with it.
I hung this feeder ~3 feet from the nearest object so squirrels would have to jump pretty far to get to it.  I have had them still jump to other feeder i replaced, but this one is skinny enough for them to think again.  The other birds can still get fed.  I used to have to fill my feeders every day, but now I have had this feeder for a week and it still has about 4" of seed left.  I Recommend hanging a feeder with fishing line (spider wire).  This allows you to hang it low so a squirrel cant get to it from the top.
To call this &#34;spill proof&#34; is ridiculous! If the can came with a simple screw cap and a separate funnel it would be fine. Instead it comes with a cap that you have to punch out the center to fit the spout, thus rendering the cap useless for sealing the canister, and an incredibly poorly designed spout that just does not work. I ended up ignoring the spout and using a plastic funnel instead. If I can find a replacement cap at least I won't have completely wasted 20 bucks. Not recommendedPros: will hold 5 gallons, does have 2 handles, is fairly stableCons: the nozzle is a waste of time, there is no separate cap for storage - the nozzle has to be in place
After reading the listing and reviews, I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms.
I like the trimmer very much although find it too heavy.  I'm not a big person.  I also find because of being able to set the trimmer head in different positions it's actually faster to do the job. For the front of hedges I position the head perpendicular to the pole then put the trimmer against the hedge and walk the length of the hedge. I don't need to swing it back and forth. On the hedges ~4' tall I make two passes.  Very quick.  The problems come on the top or backs of hedges when again the house.  Then it becomes heavy.  But, again I don't have to keep swinging it back and forth like a hand held to reach.  I would recomend it to anyone other then people that are smaller or older than I am.
A bit disappointed in the quality of this trimmer; does not feel sturdy and the weight is not balanced well. I also have an Echo gas pole trimmer with a telescoping pole with reach up to 21 ft. that is substantial in weight, but well-balanced and rock-solid. Bought this one to be used on light-weight work on smaller shrubs and be able to work standing up versus bent over using a Mantis gas trimmer that has been great, but gets heavy after awhile. I like the ease of the pivot adjustment and is a snap to take apart for storage. The charger provided should have been the type that can be wall-mounted; this has to be laid on top of a flat surface. This trimmer is good for light work, but leave the heavy thick shrubs to gas trimmers.
This item is an impoved version of a sweeper called Clean Boy. I paid over 200 bucks for one. This is basicly the same thing, but well impoved for way less than half the price.  I use it for cleaning the driveway, around the pool and the curb.  It works very well, just dont excpect it to do anything unreasonable. Stores easy also, you can hang it up by the handle and the main unit will go flat againts the wall.  sorry my reviews arent the best.. but I can tell you this item was worth it...
This is almost too good to be true. It is flimsy and simplistic but IT WORKS!!  I have a huge paver patio courtyard (about 2500 square feet) and always found keeping it swept clean to be difficult and a drudgery at best. Thus it didn't get done very often. With this sweeper it is easy and much more thorough. Just before I discovered this on Amazon my wife and I had spent several hours sweeping with a broom and a shop vac and thought we had it clean. I got this two days later and went over part of it again just to try it out. To our surprise it picked up a lot that we had apparently missed! I am still in the process of going over it all again and getting a lot but I have to believe after this first time thorough cleaning I will pick up less in the future if I use it with some regularity. Don't expect some heavy duty high tech machine but I think you will be very pleased with the job it does.
After putting this together I found it to be quite unnerving. It reminds me of a javelin. Sure it's long, but it wobbles! Do I really feel comfortable holding a wobbling chainsaw over my head? No. It cuts at the high height level but it is very unsteady and takes a bit of muscle to keep it straight on the branch. The problem is the saw blade head is just too heavy compared with the shaft and bottom.  It basically sways in the air.  I will not be using the extension rather I will just stand on a ladder to reach the higher branches. There really should be a steel pole in each piece to give it some stability. One more thing is that the blade cover doesn't stay on. It should have been designed with a clip of some sort.I'm one of those people who always throws away the product box, but I think I'll be saving this one in case it breaks.Comment Comment  Permalink
I have used this pole saw 4times in the little time I have owned it and it has done everything expected and even more. I am no stranger to the B&D brand name and the products have always served me well. I have a gas chain saw which I use when my feet are on the ground but I never ever go up a tree or ladder with it but I do have need to cut limbs I cannot reach so this battery operated pole saw takes care of that need and does it very well and the best part is the price. Very good product for the price.
I've had my B&D Pole Pruning Saw for 1 week now.  I bought this based solely on comments made on this site by people in the review. They did not disappoint.  This is a nice product. I've used it 3 times now and it cut though all branches smoothly. It is lightweight and very well made.  Before I bought this I used the Woodzig Pole saw. That is not in the same league. The B&D is far superior.  I think you will be very satisfied as I am with this product.
I have a non-heavy-duty version of this hose, which has worked well for me for a year or so now, and I wanted another NeverKink, because these hoses seem to be flexible and easy to coil by hand, yet able to keep water flowing.This hose is quite a bit more rigid/inflexible than standard garden hoses and other NeverKink hoses, which makes winding the hose onto a hanger a little more difficult, and handling the hose a little more difficult in general. The hose does seem like it will stand up to a lot of use, though.My only major gripe is that the female end of the hose seems to have developed a leak already, after only a few weeks' use, seemingly at the point where the hose is crimped onto the brass fitting. I'll probably buy a replacement female connection from the home center and put it on.
Sure, this kinks a lot less easily than a rubber hose, but NEVER SAY NEVER!!!  It's a decent hose with nice HD brass ends, but it WILL kink.  Keep in mind if you're using a hose in colder weather, rubber is the only way to go.  These vinyl hoses STINK in the cold and have a memory of how they're stored.  They're awesome in warmer climates though!Overall we're happy with the hose, but believe it shouldn't claim that it'll &#34;Never Kink&#34;.
I needed a 75' version so I added this 25' size to my 50' hose of this same type.  It is lightweight and easy to deal with.  In fact, it's so much more maneuverable, I'm really surprised.  We've had some hot weather these last few days so I've already had to water considerably and this hose has made the chore much less awkward.  I also like the fact that I can spray the vegetable garden and not worry about toxic stuff from the hose material mixing with the water and affecting my crop.  I've replaced all my hoses with this type and am very pleased with them.
The end you see in the picture with the handy plastic thumbscrew attached is actually a few threads shorter than a standard hose. I have a rain barrel that I wanted to use this with but it will not get a bite on the plastic faucet. My standard 50' garden hose attaches okay, as well as a quick disconnect adapter that I was using, but not this hose. Other than that is is a good quality hose and I will still use it to get water from my barrels to the gardens, just not as I originally intended.
This is the 2nd roll I've purchased, so that should tell you how much I like it.  I got a 50' roll first, and liked it enough to buy another 25' roll so I would have enough and some extra to cover all my yard.This is the first hose I've used/owned that you didn't have to be super careful not to kink.  It always seemed like the higher end the hose was, the softer it was, and the more it would kink on me.  I can just roll/unroll this hose when I need it, and no issues so far.  Highly recommended.
This hose is just as described.  Very nice and light.  I connected it and in spite of having purchased some of those rubber rings to prevent leakage, I didn't need to use any except the one it has.  It does not leak at all, and is very easy to take around my patio to water my plants.  I was considering purchasing the &#34;new&#34; green ones that expand to double or more their size, but everybody reports having trouble with them and so I looked for an alternative.  This is it for me!  Light, but very nicely made.
I looked at all the Hori-Horis available on Amazon and read all the reviews before settling on this one as a present for my girlfriend, an avid gardener. She was impressed by the quality, and likes how it can be used as a shallow trowel, a bulb planter, a perennial divider, a root cutter, and more. It's very handy in her garden, which borders on a nature preserve full of invasive plants. It's attractive and well made, too. I'd recommend it for any outdoor gardener.
I bought this last year so this is the first spring I have had to use it.  I am seriously impressed.  I am using it for popping out weeds, hacking down dead vegetation and planting.  It doesn't dig a wide hole and does not work as well as a trowel for removing dirt while planting, but it works much better than a trowel to plant in my horribly rocky clay areas and the blade makes it easy to puncture a hole to put the plant tag.The sharpness of this is tool makes it extremely useful.  I think the serrated blade will make sharpening difficult, but for this price it is well worth getting a new one when it gets dull.  I will definitely do so and am buying some for gifts for my fellow gardening friends.Also, if you wonder what the difference between the models 1515 and 1516, according to the company's web site this one is a stainless version of the black 1515.
This is a fine little scoop. I use mine for scooping charcoal into my chimney starter, and it's big enough, strong enough, good enough, and darn it, people like it. While I wouldn't go quite so far as one reviewer in saying that it looks like a $100 item from a specialty store (wish I owned a specialty store in his/her neighborhood lol), it does look well made, the finish is decent, and it is sturdy enough to lift a lot more of whatever you're lifting than will fit into the scoop.That's the scoop as I see it, hope some of you find my review helpful!
I buy 50 pound bags of dog food and have been using plastic bowls to scoop out the chow into a bucket to carry into the dog pen to fill poochie's dish. After going through several bowls which tend to crack and break, I purchased this aluminum scoop.Hot dog, does it work so much better than a bowl!! It's strong and durable and will last no doubt for many years. I didn't measure how much, but the scoop holds a lot, and I can fill a bucket in no time.What else can I say about a scoop? It's strong, has a nice finish to it, it's easy to use, and holds a lot. In fact it's so nice, I'll probably have to hide it from the Grill King so he doesn't scarf it to use for the charcoal.
I've always felt it's probably a little unsanitary to use an aluminum beer can with inked labeling on a hot grill.  Maybe not, but it gives me pause.  This device works as a more stable and possibly more healthy alternative to a can of Bud.  It is also perfect if you want to use other liquids such as wine, juice or whatever.  The only downside is the clean-up.  It consists of four parts, each of which get coated with chicken drippings and need some serious scrubbing to get off the cooked-on residue.  I've found a dishwasher alone doesn't really remove all of it.  A little scrubbing is necessary to really get the device clean.This is certainly a useful item for us backyard cooks.  It's a little inconvenient compared to using a beer can that can be tossed in the trash after using.
This has to be the best chicken rack out there.  It's easy to use, easy to clean, and pretty to boot.  I gave this to my husband with the cookbook, **Beer-Can Chicken: And 74 Other Offbeat Recipes for the Grill** (http://www.amazon.com/Beer-Can-Chicken-Other-Offbeat-Recipes/dp/0761120165/ref=pd_bxgy_ol_img_b/105-3317259-8297264) and it's been terrific recipe after terrific recipe ever since.  You CANNOT make chicken this good in the kitchen--it's better than any rotisserie, better than any baked chicken --ever--.  You've got to try this--you won't be sorry!
The Good:  These skewers are perfect, much better than traditional round ones and infinitely better than wooden ones.  For everyone who has ever had the frustration of trying to turn your food on the grill only to have the skewer turn inside the food and the food stay stuck to the grill, these wide rectangular skewers are perfect.  They are very long and very durable as well.  I have cooked numerous meals with them to include beef, vegetables and chicken.  Every one came out perfect and I never had a problem with the skewer sliding around inside the food itself.The Bad:  Even though these are stainless steel, after cooking with them and washing them off they rusted.  I quickly solved this problem with a Brillo pad and before I put the skewers away in the drawer, I coated them with a very light coat of olive oil.  Problem solved.
After chasing food around the typical round metal & wood skewers for quite a while I decided to go on the hunt for a better skewer, and I found them! The "flat vs round" design allows whatever food you have on them to stay in place so that everything cooks evenly. The point, although sharp is not overly so but still sharp enough to easily pierce raw meat and the 18" length gives you plenty of room to "load em" down with goodies or space the food out whichever suits the food being grilled. The loop handle makes it easier to grasp the skewers with a mit or tongs.A previous reviewer mentioned the 18" length and I'll agree depending upon your grill this length may be a bit long and they may be a tad better 2" shorter [that reviewer just cut his to fit].I gave these skewers 5 stars as I don't anticipate having to find anything better for kabobs!
These are perfect kabob skewers.  Very sturdy, sharp point to get through food, wide flat edge so the food doesn't spin around when you are flipping them as it invariably does with round skewers.  More expensive than bamboo skewers but unless you lose these, they should last forever.  Pay attention to the measurements as these bad boys are long.  I have a WSM 22.5 inch and 22 inch Performer and these fit but not on my 18 One Touch Silver or the little Smokey Joe.  If you have a small grill these may not work.  Otherwise, they are perfect.
I use these gloves every time a bbq, so that means i use them at least once a week!  the gloves work great for taking hot meats out of the smoker.  Havent had any issues with these gloves EXCEPT for cleaning them, the exterior part is fine, but as soon as moisture gets on the inside of the gloves, it starts to kinda smell.  So make sure when you clean them that you dont get water in there.EDIT : less then a week after i reviewed these gloves, one of the fingers somehow got a rip in it and when i reached into a 200 degree pork shoulder without realizing of the rip... that was fun.  The other glove is still fine.. but now i need to order a new pair  :/  Lasted 6 months
These worked great for handling hot meat.  We also used them to adjust the hot racks in our smoker.  This partially melted the gloves so maybe that wasn't a smart idea.  Still useable, but a little rough and melty looking on the finger tips.Find it difficult to wash inside and out.  Some reviewers washed as if you were washing your hands but I require more disinfecting than that.  I would first wash while wearing them, then soak them, and even ran it through the dishwasher.  The melty fingers definately made it more difficult to clean.  Overall not that hard, just stating its not a wiz bang situation (and lord help you if you get the inside dirty)
If you smoke meat, these gloves are a must. They are food grade and insulated.Allows you to handle the meat in the smoker without using tongs or heaven forbid, forks (bad word).Always put a cuff at the bottom, unless you like the feeling of meat juice running down your arms.Easily cleaned, mild soap and water.A little stiff due to the thickness of the coating and insulation, but nothing to complain about.I store mine in a gallon baggie. Note: Fold gloves and put a paper towel over the outside of the glovesbefore trying to put them in the bag. Try it without the paper towel and you will quickly know what I mean.
I'm a bit of a fanatic when it comes to handling foods on the BBQ and the smoker.  Before the food is cooked I prefer to use disposable nitrile gloves for prepping meat and putting it on the BBQ/smoker because I can "feel" the product I am working with.  While the food is cooking I prefer to use leather gloves for handling non-food utensils, hot lids, water pans, charcoals, wood, etc.  If the food needs to be handled while cooking or smoking though, or once the food is cooked/smoked and needs handling, pulling, etc, these are what I use.  They can be cleaned easily by putting them on, soaping them up, and washing your hands under the faucet.  They are an essential part of my backyard BBQ/smoker work and greatly appreciated by the folks who will be dining with us.
As others have stated these gloves do have an over whelming &#34;plastic&#34; smell to them when first opening the package, but that smell did go away. They do repel heat fairly good, but my gripe with them is that they are waaay to slippery. You cannot grab any type of meat or pull any meat apart as your hands will slide all over the place. I didn't use them to grab any hot metal objects, so I cant comment on that. But I rarely use them now only to grab meat from the grill (with a fork or thongs as I don't trust these gloves and the meat might slip out of my hands) and place them on a plate or cutting board, so for what I paid I cant be to upset. Also I didn't want to get water inside the gloves when cleaning them because I didn't know how the glove would dry being wet so I wear them and wash them as if I am washing my hands with warm water and soap.
These are essentially fancy leather welding gloves. Welding gloves have to protect you from being burned by spatters of molten metal, that cool almost immediately upon landing on a surface at room temperature. Cooking mitts, on the other hand, need to be able to hold a 400 degree object for many seconds without transmitting the heat. They also need to insulate even if they're wet.I found that this glove, despite being well made and attractive, is no good for holding hot items. At best, it protects hand and arm while grilling, if you're using tongs, lets say, over a very hot fire. Just don't expect to be able to hold a hot pan for more than a couple of seconds before the heat is conveyed directly to your tender skin and you have to put it down immediately or drop it.
These gloves fit my size 9 hands a bit on the large size but after leaving them out one nice Florida rainy night they now fit just right.  The long cuffs are just right for opening the lid of my Weber Genesis 6611001 E-310 637-Square-Inch 38,000-BTU Natural-Gas Grill, Black.  I have used leather gloves before this and my forearms were always a bit too warm for comfort.  I cook outside about 4 times a week, summer, fall, winter (if you can call it winter in Florida) and spring working between the rain showers.
Purchased this since my 09 honda fit had a light on for the tire pressure. Took it to the gas station but the light never went away since their gauge was inaccurate. I used the inflator and it was very easy to use. The hose clamped on and was able to get air and a good reading on the pressure gauge. I put too much air but luckily this has a built in pressure release so I was able to have exactly 33 psi on my tires. Whether that gauge is accurate or not my air pressure light went away. I also use this on my 99 jeep xj with problem. The gauge has rubber around it so it helps protect the glass. This gauge is nice and for the price you can't go wrong.
works as it should..no problem..i always change the air chuck filler valve to the ball push on type..it a matter of choice..easy and cheap to change..don't like the lever action..because 1.its hard to keep on, slips off 2. hard on valve stem if its old 3.wrong angle...its a simple fix..plus the overinflat check valve is a nice feature..the last one i had lasted 5 years and i misplaced it..by the way i am a mechanic of 45 plus years..always looking for tools to make the job easier.
This works very well as a tire inflator. As best I can tell, the gauge is accurate - at least within a few psi of accurate.  The bleed valve is a nice feature.You will need a quick connect.  This one works perfectly -Dixon DCP20B Brass Air Chief Industrial Interchange Quick-Connect Air Hose Fitting, Plug, 1/4" Coupling x 1/4" NPT FemaleI had no trouble with the valve connection and the red hose is plenty flexible to get wherever you need it.  This is good for car tires with the big valve, but you will need an adapter for a presta valve.  These work great -Slime 23042 Presta to Schrader Valve AdapterThere is a marking on the handle of this that says 100psi max, but the gauge reads to 150 psi.  I did not have trouble getting my tires to 120 psi with this (using a presta adapter).
I got this to go with my Craftsman air compressor that I recently got as the compressor only came with a basic inflator for the tires.  I wanted one that had a gauge on it so you could read the tire pressure when you are inflating the tires.  My compressor uses the &#34;M&#34; fittings, so I  bought the Campbell Hausfield kit to go with it to be able to get it to connect to my compressor quick connects.The inflator is fairly simple to use, just put the chuck on the tire stem and pull the lever on the chuck and inflate.  The gauge seems to be fairly accurate as I compared it to a regular tire gauge and the readings were the same.This inflator seems to be good quality and will work for what I need which is occasional use around the house.  It is a decent price at around 14 bucks.
I got this saw after an ice-storm in Tulsa caused serious damage to a dozen trees.  It had no problem cutting through a 16" oak trunk.It's a workhorse that performs well. It tends to drink oil, but I guess that's good for performance and chain life.There's a gizmo that's a screwdriver/wrench for chain removal.  I lost mine because THERE'S NOWHERE ON THE SAW HOUSING TO STASH IT (are you listening Poulan).  Otherwise, chain adjustment and removal are pretty straightforward.
We purchased the first of these in a refurbished unit and did quite a bit of work on it before it started having trouble. The repair was minor but the bench fee was nearly the price of replacing so went ahead and bought a 2nd one - used the chain etc from the first as spares. Pleased with the purchse. For a fraction of the cost of having tree trimmers come out for one visit this gets the job done fast. Strong enough to make quick work of most jobs plus, living in a hurricane prone state means we often need to remove limbs, large branches or even trees that come down during a storm. Rather than wait days or even weeks - this allows us to move about the yard without danger. A must own - great price. reliable product.
This Gilmour brass quick connector is made in China.  As with other Gilmour products it has a warning that it contains a chemical known by the state of California to cause cancer. That is nothing new about China using dangerous chemicals. On the good news side the parts of the connector that are handled have a rubber cover which hopefully is safe.I have been using the plastic quick connectors and they have worked well but I just wanted to see how a brass one would perform. The main difference that I have noticed is that the plastic ones are easier to connect and disconnect. However, both types provide satisfactory performance and do not leak. The main difference is that the plastic Gardena connectors that I have been using cost about half the amount of the brass Gilmour.  The Gardena connectors are made in Germany.
i was skeptical about these, but i tried them anyway.  glad i did.i was worried that they may affect the water pressure somehow, and my worries were unfounded.  these things are great.  i'm using them for everything.the only problem is that you will realize how many of them you actually need, and you'll buy a lot of them.FYI, i was able to pick up the male+female connector set at lowe's for around $6 (HD doesn't carry this brand).  you may want to check there first before ordering here.  but as far as the product itself goes, it's top notch.
Chunk those cheap plastic connectors and save tempers.  I could have used several sets of these years ago; however, today one is sufficient for present needs. I use teflon tape to assure 100% drip-less action and now can disconnect our hose with ease and speed.  Gilmour makes life so much simpler when all parts work well and last far longer than the plastic ones.  Additionally, this connector set is a no issue set.  Put it on the bib and forget about it.  When winter comes it will stay in place and be ready for use in the spring.  I highly recommend and will buy another as soon as I get a new connector elsewhere.
I have about 5 sets of these for each hose at my house as well as my Gilmour foam gun, AR pressure washer, CR Spotless, and a couple of hose nozzles.  The brass is strong, the mechanics are crisp, and the rubber gives excellent impact protection.  The only thing you will be replacing from this equation is the o-rings every year or so, depending on use.  This set will make your life a whole lot easier, and no more struggling in trying to loosen or tighten the hose from the house.
In the past I've always limited my search for hose couplings to local hardware stores.  That was a mistake.  After searching Amazon and finding this highly rated product, I decided to give it a try.  Boy is this a heck of a lot better than what I've been getting.Installation is a cinch and once you have it screwed on, it isn't coming off.The threaded part of this coupling is nicely machined and screws together nicely with other attachments.  After I tried one of these, I immediately bought more and used them to replace the couplings on my other hoses.
As soon as you put this in your hand you will kick yourself for not having bought it sooner.  Like many, I bought $1, $5, $7 nozzles that lasted all of one season.  They are just cheap junk.  We forget about how often we replace them because they are cheap at the time.  This particular model is their heavy duty, which should last though hot summers and cold winters.  It has brass components, a nice sturdy feel and is rated for both extreme hot and cold water conditions.  It attaches easily and does not drip at all during use.  A small depression of the handle gives you a gentle fan while a full depression gives you a powerful stream.  Compare this one with that cheapo you have now and you will clearly see the difference.  It is certainly money well spent.
It is getting harder and harder to find nozzles like this that have infinately variable spray, ranging from a fan to a steady stream just by squeezing the lever.  Most new ones require you to twist a nozzel on the end...which is a waste of time when washing a car.  I have used this before.  I have 3 worn out ones in my garage.  I was happy to see  they have a lifetime warranty which I did not know.  The picture does not show it, but it has a nozzel shield surrounding the threads on the spray end.  Helpful in case it falls up against a fender!  Works great.
I have bought so many hose nozzles over the years, from cheap to not-so-cheap.  They last a few seasons and then get clogged, leak or just plain break.  This Gilmour nozzle feels like it will last forever.  Nice solid feel, easy to use, good control over spray and velocity.  The threaded front is a bonus.  I add a &#34;water breaker&#34; to turn it into a gentle shower head for watering potted plants, without slowing me down by restricting the water volume output.  I can also screw on a pressure nozzle for a more focused spray and still have the pistol grip on/off.  Really happy with this purchase!
The best benefit is that I can roll it out to the yard and have all my stuff right there - no more walking back and forth to the garage ort trying to carry too much at once!  I like the wheels it comes with - they are not a cheap hollow plastic that easily snaps and they actually roll over the gravel. They will need to be sprayed with WD40 from time to time to keep them nice.  I fit all my handled yard tools on it, and find it just as easy to access tools as the kind of thing that hangs on the wall. If it had a large handle on the side, like a push-cart has it would be 100% perfect for pushing it around as hanging a towel or two on. Just a thought, manufacturer.....
Got tired of buying all those little cans for 3+ bucks each, so got this to hookup the 20lb tank I got from Lowe's to my newCuisinart CGG-200 All-Foods 12,000-BTU Portable Outdoor Tabletop Propane Gas Grill.  Works great.  No problems at all.So when grilling at home, we'll be using this.  For camping or tailgating or anything, we'll go with the little cans.It all seems so obvious...so if you're in the same situation - get this and save money.  It works, and you don't need any extra adapters.
I picked this feeder because I wasn't sure any birds would find my feeder, and I don't have a ton of disposable income.I'm happy to say that a squirrel family has adopted the feeder as its own personal buffet. It's my fault, I hung it too close to the house, but it's all I've got, really. So I watch the squirrels, who eat a LOT of food. But! Today I saw actual birds happily chirping and snacking at it!The feeder is plastic, so I imagine it'll scratch/fade/oxidize over time. Seed spills out the holes at the perches when I'm filling it, which is a drag. But that's me being picky. For the price, it's a terrific feeder!
I have had this feeder for about 5 years now, it has never fallen apart. I don't know what the other people are talking about-wobbling-if its hung on a tree or pole hook it swings a bit but how does a hanging bird feeder wobble? Anyway its not the best made on the market, but the birds seem to like it. It is a pain to take apart to clean and it should really have metal perches instead of plastic. The squirrels have gnawed off two of the perches since they hang upside down and eat the Safflower seeds (even tho they are not supposed to like it)I am ready to replace it now-but will be looking for a feeder with the metal perches instead.
I think this feeder is just adorable and the finches love it. Although it is made from plastic it is very sturdy and the perches "lock in" to the tube...generating a very solid feel.  The "comfort perches" are amazing...the little guys feed longer from this feeder than any other, and the finches who are waiting for "their turn", sing up a storm of sweet melodies in anticpation.  The design allows for the seed to stay put without spewing all over and wasting expensive seed.  The size of the 6 little feeder holes discourage larger birds (doves, pigeons) from stealing the seed from the "little ones". The screw on cap makes it easy to fill and clean.  I live in Las Vegas so I will be careful not to leave it in the blazing summer sun. I highly recommend this feeder for bird lovers/watchers.
I have this feeder placed right outside my window of my ground floor apartment. I originally got it for the cats' entertainment, and am glad I did.I originally had a feeder bell hanging from the second floor apartment's balcony, but decided it wasn't enough.I purchased this feeder for the sparrows and used the cheapest bird feed available. After I switched to sunflower seeds only I am now getting sparrows, finches and starlings. The down side being that the perches were not designed for starlings so they have to reach around to one of the other holes to get their food.Anymore, I can get 5 or so on it at once with two or three hanging out on the chain it hangs from waiting in line.I really love this little feeder and have had it since December '08.  Never once had a problem with squirrels, but it may be because of the way I have it set up.
I purchased two of these with the hopes of feeding a few of the neighborhood birds. I knew instantly this was a mistake, but thought I would give it a try. One lasted only a few days at best. A larger bird actually knocked off the plastic holder that keeps the food in and it all poured straight to the ground. Entertaining to watch and the birds all thought it was great to eat the seed off the ground.  The second one lasted a little longer - a few months perhaps, but again, the same thing happened. Food everywhere and a useless feeder.  I am back again to find myself two new feeders for this year and thought it would be wise to advise all of you of my experience.  Sorry to have to give it a one star, but I can't find a reason to even go for two.
We have experienced both squirrels and rabbits in our yard last season, and I picked this up to prevent the same from happening this season.What impressed me is this is not poison to pets, since we have three small chihuahuas and two cats who are at risk in our yard. Instead, it uses egg to make it smell like something dead, and capsaisin to make it taste awful. So when you spray it, it is safe to spray directly on the plants that you are using in your garden.In fact, this is approved by the OMRI as an organic product, so it can be used safely!The sprayer is a bit cumbersome, but it is still a lot easier to use than a simple spray bottle and allows it to be sprayed over a larger area. This larger bottle covers up to 1000 square feet, and will more than cover my anticipated garden area for this spring.
We live out in the country, and my wife is an avid gardener.  We also have a roaming band of deer, usually 3-4, as well as rabbits, I've personally seen 3 at once in our yard.  We don't have many squirrels, I guess the cats and coyotes take care of them..  We have experimented with bloodmeal, and a variety of other home remedies that haven't worked very well.This product however, has worked quite well.  We have not seen any rabbits/deer, or prints from either in any of the gardens we have applied it to.  The battery sprayer works well, I'm not sure it's really necessary for the size of our gardens, I probably wouldn't pay extra for it.  I will purchase the concentrate in the future, as the pre-made mixture will not last a season, and seems to come at a premium price.
Since we live in the country, we have a lot of wildlife in our yard.  While they are cute to look at, they can do a lot of damage, and some of them don't smell very good(SKUNKS)!  We have had a problem with raccoons and skunks destroying flower planters and digging up newly planted annuals. This product helped keep them out of the flowers and the battery powered sprayer makes it easy to use.One winter the deer "trimmed" all our shrubs, even the ones right next to the house. Since our area was hit hard by EHD this past year, we didn't have that problem this past winter; and I was delighted this morning to see three deer walking down our driveway. I love watching all the wildlife, and just try to keep them out of the flowers and vegetable garden.
I've maintained a garden patch for quite a few years and it has always been affected by some type of animals.  First, there were squirrels until I built a small fence.  Then there were deer until I built a bigger fence.  Then, squirrels found their way in from the top and others from below.This Deer Off seems to be helping more than any of these.  I didn't spray it around the whole yard (that's just mean), but I did set up quite the perimeter around my garden and I haven't had any animals intruding there whatsoever.  Is this the work of the Deer Off spray, or is it simply coincidence?  I'd like to think the spray is working just fine.
I have a lot of rabbit and deer damage in my garden if I don't spray.  I like to alternate various sprays to keep them guessing.  This worked very well against both rabbits and deer.  I sprayed some potted begonias that had been eaten down to stubs and they are now thriving and the same with some balloon flowers.  I assume it was the rabbits that were eating them although I never actually saw the culprit.  At any rate this spray took care of the problem. It also protected my day lilies against the deer than had been munching on them.  Easy to apply too.
I'm a terrible gardener. So when I finally got my watermelons to bud and start to grow I was extremely happy... until I went out and checked on them one day and either the deer or rabbits ate them all.This is a hazard for me as I'm right next to a very large forrested area. While I enjoy seeing the wildlife I didn't want to keep losing my fruits and veggies to them so I got this Deer Off. I'm happy to say that I've not had any part of my garden taken so far. And since I localized the spray to just around the garden I still see the animals on the far side of the yard (a couple hundred feet away.)I'm happy with this product and wish I'd gotten it prior to losing my watermelons.
I got this at a neighbor's recommendation and I am glad I did.  I live in Deer Country and it is not uncommon to see deer strolling on local lawns even in bright daylight.  This is an effective product and deer are repelled by the taste.  I was surprised that this product had the flavors of peppery egg, which deer and small rodents apparently don't enjoy.Although this product has a bad smell, it is not overpowering and it does do the job.  This does not have a strong odor and is not human repellent based on that.You get a  motorized pupmp that runs on batteries.  It does work well and it is easy to aim and spray.  I would certainly recommend this.  It is gentle on your foliage and other greenery.
I sprayed this on my yard, not to protect any of my greenery but to stop the squirrels from climbing up the wall and into the gutters and roof. So far, I can't tell if its the rain or the Havahart spray that stopped the squirrels but so far I haven't seen any squirrels running around in the general area. This leads me to believe its the rain that is shooing the squirrels away. I will save the rest of the Deer Off when spring time arrives or when the squirrels come back around.
Rabbits have been feasting on my new lawn and I was excited to be able to try Deer Off from the Vine program. However, while rabbits are one of the critters it says it repels, I guess rabbits didn't read it. The first try I liberally sprayed it all around the perimeter of the grassy area I was trying to protect. But, judging by the fresh rabbit droppings I found each morning afterwards, I suspected it wasn't working. My second try I liberally sprayed everywhere, perimeter and main lawn, and later that night I checked outside and found 2 rabbits feasting away. Maybe they like eggs, but it doesn't appear to work on rabbits, at least not the ones I have here in San Diego.
I have been using this for a little while now and while it seems to work fairly well it only lasts a week without rain and if it rains you pretty much have to go out there the same day and reapply or you get to wake up first thing in the morning to your strawberries that hang near the fence being eaten...It's good idea for the most part but it's something that just doesn't really seem to be a lasting benefit and it seems to be a more natural avenue for repelling the deer and it does work just not nearly as long as I would like it to.I've been using it for a couple month on the garden/around it to keep the unwanted animals away and it does seem to work pretty good so far, just as I said, it doesn't last nearly as long as I would like it to.
Great for protecting baby fruit/nut/landscape trees from deer rubs.We have a lot of property in GA, mostly timberland, but with some fruit/nut trees planted on some cleared land where we have a small hunting cabin. We've tried a lot of different methods for keeping deer from rubbing all the bark off and killing the young trees -- this spray seems to be pretty effective. Just apply it around the time they start leaving rub marks, and trees stay safe, and alive. A little expensive, but a good option for those who don't want to bother with physical measures like protective sheathing or fencing.
I bought this to try at my parents' cabin.  They have a major problem with deer eating their ornamental plants, specfically tiger lillies and hostos (or is it hostas).This particular product is nice because it the sprayer is battery operated.  So my parents like the convenience.Now for the disadvantages... I'd rather smell my own flatuence after chilli than smell this. It's awful.  But, then again many other chemical sprayers reek.  Also, this is not a set it and forget option.  You need to pay a lot of attention and reapply.  Lastly, you cannot use it for plants that will bear fruit or vegetables for consumption.All and all it's a new twist on an old concept.  I'd use it again.
Living near the woods, we have all kinds of critters:  chipmunks, squirrels, rabbits, racoons, and deer.  In addition there is my nutty dog, so I don't want to use anything toxic around her.  Deer Off has non toxic ingredients, and so far seems to repel the critters, though it's still early in the season and I haven't yet planted my flowers due to the cold weather.  I especially like that Deer Off doesn't require mixing, an improvement over products I've used in past years.  So far so good, but I'll update on effectiveness when my garden is planted.
I spray the deer off on all my flowers and fruit trees, it works pretty good.  I have tried other products and nothing keeps the deer from eating the flowers or fruit trees.  The deer off works for a week or so on the plants that my sprinklers spray daily, longer for the plants that I spray that do not get watered on the area I spray.  As long as I remember to spray the flowers the deer tend to not eat them, only a few times a really hungry deer came through and ate a few of the plants that were sprayed but not many.
This product was easy to set up and start using. The sprayer is battery operated so spraying it around the garden was a breeze. Fortunately there are no deer in our area, but I have all sorts of smaller critters digging up my garden... squirrels, rabbits, cats, and raccoons.  I applied this product a few weeks ago to certain parts of my garden that I have noticed digging in and so far so good. The areas have not been dug up again (which is usually what happens when I repair the damage the critters have caused).  I will update my results when more time has passed. I really like that this product is pretty much odorless. I have used other products in the past that were really nasty smelling. They not only kept the critters away, but they kept me and other family members away because the garden smelled so bad.
I started using this on my trail to keep the deer away, now I have been spaying it around my straw garden. I have not had any problems with deer or squirrels eating my plants. The sprayer works fine, and it doesn't hurt pets or wildlife. You do have to spray again after it rains, but other than that, this has worked pretty well for me so far. The instructions say to clean the sprayer to prevent clogging, but I have never bothered to do this. It has never clogged up on me. The product is made from eggs, but I have never really noticed any smell from using this.
I had trouble getting this to spray. Some of the other reviews offer useful tips on this problem.The active ingredients are similar to certain related products: "Contains putrescent eggs solids (4.63%), garlic (.001%) and capsaicin (.001%)." My experience with these is that they work well for up to a couple of weeks, although they need to be reapplied after a rain, or even after heavy sprinkler use. A downside of this formula is that the smell of garlic will permeate the garden.
The Ready-to-use Deer Off II worked very well at repelling squirrels for about 2 weeks, not the claimed three months, and then its effect diminished.I tested the ready-to-use Deer Off II in my back yard because I've had to pick up Squirrel droppings to prevent my dog from eating them.  I did not find squirrel droppings in my back yard for about two weeks after application to my shrubs and the perimeter of the small yard.  Two weeks later I'm finding an increased number of squirrel droppings.Its battery operated sprayer worked very well.  I like the safety lock just below the sprayer's trigger. I intend to use the sprayer for my weed killer even though the power could be improved.
First of all, the battery that came with it didn't work, so I had to buy new ones.  The lock switch on the spray head is hard to lock and unlock. It took awhile for the liquids to start coming out after I held down the spray trigger. Probably like 5 minutes. Anyways, once it starts, it work ok. Doesn't have much pressure to spray far. Anyways, after spraying like quarter of the bottle on my trees, entire backyard smelled like burned wood. I haven't seen squirrels on those trees so far and it's been 2 weeks.
I've used this product in the past and am still using it in a concentrated formulation because it is cost effective. I live near a wooded area that is inhabited by deer and other creatures. I also have a couple of resident rabbits in the yard. This does an effective job of keeping the critters away from my flowers and succulents. It is easy to use and has a big plugin that you don't have to mix it. Spray the plants as directed and forget it. The only negative is that normally given the amount of rainfall we experience, this does not last for 3 months. I spray about every  6 weeks. Doing this diligently duing the growth season seems to keep animals away. The deer have stopped feeding on the hostas, plumeria, etc.This size is great for an average yard and should last for at least one season.
As the title of my review says, the electric sprayer is excellent. It took probably a minute of priming (pressing the trigger with nothing coming out of the sprayer) during my first use before the spray started to come out; since then, it sprays right away when I pull the trigger.The spray stream goes about six feet or so, and it's easy enough to aim it at trees or fence or whatever. You can adjust the tip of the sprayer in order to make the spray more of less focused (that is, more stream or more misty).I'll use this spray bottle even after the repellent is gone. It will be useful for weed sprays, insect repellents, etc.The repellent itself has only been moderately successful in our yard. Our issue is bunnies and they haven't seemed to be bothered by the repellent - their activity in our yard after a couple of applications of the repellent is basically the same as before the applications.
I've put a lot of money and care into my landscaping and have had trouble preventing deer from eating much of it, so I thought I'd give this a try.Since applying this product I've seen deer in the area a few times, but they haven't even come into my yard.  To be fair, it hasn't rained since applying this, so I don't know how effective it would or how good a job I did with applying this to the underside of flowers and leaves.Really liked the electric applicator and the holster on the bottle.  It did take longer to prime than what I expected, but it was a breeze to use once it was primed.  Very easy on the hands.  Did get a little on myself when adjusting the spray and there is no evidence of an offensive order I've noticed when using other products.I will purchase this again in the future.
My small garden had frequest visits from rabbits, squirrels, and other small pests.  However, regular applications of the HAVAHART DEER OFF II stopped the night time visits cold.  This was true even in the late fall when rain comes a little more frequently to the area - the DEER OFF II was not easily washed away and continued to protect my leafy greens.I also appreciated the battery-operated sprayer.  As someone who easily gets hand cramps and forearm pain from typical pump sprayers, I was happy to pay a little extra for the battery-operated bottle.  You don't really have to use alot, depending on the size of your garden, but it made my hand very happy.This product was ideal all the way around - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!
I am not quite ready to make a large declaration of "Eureka" for this product. The reason is because we wanted to use this to see if it would help keep the rabbit and squirrel out of the garden and it isn't yet time for the big test as we just got finished planting. For now I can say I haven't seen an increase in critter and I haven't experienced any negatives from the product. I will make sure to update in a few weeks when things get ready to harvest to talk about how well the product really worked.I can say the product was easy to apply and the smell isn't overpowering. I felt safe using it near fruits and veggies growing (but did not spray it "on" any of the raised bed garden frames).Will definitely update in a few weeks.
I like the fact that Deer Off is all-natural or I wouldn't have used it.  It comes with a battery-operated sprayer that works fairly well and delivers a good stream.  I walked twice around my garden while spraying a steady stream of Deer off around the perimeter.  The sprayer should be flushed out with clean water after each use.The odor around my garden wasn't unpleasant to me.  An application is supposed to last for 90 days but long before 90 days I saw rabbits in the garden.  On the plus side I haven't seen any signs of deer in the garden, and they potentially eat a lot more than rabbits.So it's effectiveness is inconclusive but at least it doesn't hurt to try.
We wanted to use Deer Off on a weeping willow tree that deer have almost pushed over. They seem to think it's a good place to sharpen their horns.We staked the tree back upright and the deer have seemed to have left the tree alone. Don't know if it was the Deer Off, the time of year or because the deer could also smell us and where we touched the tree.Edit to add more information:When Spring got here, after planting our garden, we had deer eating our tomato plants right off at the base so we sprayed our entire garden with this. This Deer Off has seemed to deter the deer but it burnt our plants. Every plant we sprayed has burnt places on them.The sprayer is also not easy to use.
I still have all my flowers out front so it must be working.  It has a mild smell when first sprayed but dries up and becomes odorless fairly quickly.  It doesn't bother my dog though as he still walks up to the bushes to urinate on them, so dogs, or at least him, must not be bothered by it.  I use this in combination with the Havahart Solar Powered Water Sprinkler in my backyard raised garden bed and so far so good.  If you have trouble with rabbits, deers, and squirrels, give it a try.  It's safe around humans and pets.  I recommend it.
I've had this on the plants for about a week now and so far I have seen less damage from the deer.  That might be somewhat seasonal, so I'll have to watch and see over the long term how effective this is.  I've also sprayed it around the trash cans to keep the raccoons away and it has been effective at that too.  I can certainly smell it myself, so this is not something you'll want to spray onto plants  near a door or window.  Thanks to the powered spayer, it is easy to apply.  In that regard I think this would be an excellent product for anyone with limited strength or mobility.  I can definitely see this as being helpful for an older person with a lot of property or greenery who has a critter problem.
We've had continual issues with deer, rabbits, squirrels and chipmunks eating our flowers, vegetables and fruit.  We've tried lot of things to reduce the problem and this is the easiest and about as effective as it gets.  I was somewhat concerned that the spray might damage the plants or have a repulsive smell.  I sprayed it on many kinds of flowers, several kinds of fruit and tomatoes with no ill effect and no noticeable smell once it was dry.  The deer seem to be repelled, with no evidence of any damage from them.  On the negative side, the chipmunks aren't deterred at all.  They love to eat petunias and proceeded to gobble them up.As a side note, the sprayer runs on batteries and is better than hand pumping.  The adjustment for the type of spray is a bit lacking, but it sort of works.If you have deer problems give it a try.  If you're trying to control chipmunks, don't waist your time.
We had a woodchuck last year, a big woodchuck, that decided to set up camp in our backyard.  She(I believe it is a she) ate everything she could get to, nothing was safe.  Thankfully the vegetable garden had a fence but we lost half of our unfenced flower garden.  As soon as things started sprouting this year I started spraying but not what I thought was excessive.  We have not seen our big friend in our garden this year but I did see her in a neighbors yard the other day so I'm hoping it was the Havahart Deer Off and not that she moved to a better neighborhood.We don't have a problem with rabbits or deer and the only issue we have with squirrels is they like to bury nuts in our garden and flower boxes in the fall, so we will see how it goes with them later in the year. The sprayer works well and I'm really interested to see how long the pump lasts and will update as to that also. Recommended.
I have lots of mulched areas in my yard. After using Havahart Deer Off II, I have noticed that the squirrels and rabbits do not go near those sprayed areas. It is wonderful to not have to clean up the mulch everyday...and plants can continue to grow! The sprayer was amazingly simple to use with the battery powered sprayer and it takes much less effort than using a hand triggered device. I don't have any deer around my property, so I can't address its effectiveness in keeping them at bay, but it sure worked for repelling the other critters. I'm looking forward to spring!
We have a ton of wild bunnies where I live and I love to grow green beans.  Unfortunately, the bunnies love the green bean plants too.  I was having a worse than usual year where they were chewing my beans down to the ground regularly.  I got the Deer Off and, guess what, I have green bean plants again!  It has completely stopped them from eating my plants.  I also love the battery powered sprayer.  My garden is decent sized and other sprayers make my hand sore by the time I'm done which makes me less likely to use the product as often as I should.  With this, I just hold the trigger down and it does all the work.  My only complaint is that it washes away when I water or it rains so I'm out there every single day applying the Deer Off.  If it rains or I water and don't do it, the bunnies are back snacking on my green bean plants.
We have a yard full of fruit trees that we never get to enjoy any fruit from.We also have a mature pecan tree and have to purchase pecans.The squirrels steal everything before it's ready to harvest.I was excited to try this and hoped it would allow us to sample some of the fruit we never get to eat.The battery operated sprayer is very nice, making it extremely easy to use.Our squirrels must be very determined little critters because they weren't phased by the product and continued to strip the fruit from the trees at their normal pace.Part of the problem may be their ability to leap from tree to tree without having to climb the trunks to get to the fruit.The product may work better under different circumstances.
Easy enough to apply and not messy.In order to test it's effectiveness we not only applied this to our own trees but with the permission of one of our neighbors we applied it to two of her trees as well. This was two months ago and I have to admit that all the trees that were treated with this product were avoided by the deer. Including our neighbors two trees, while her other trees and bushes were chewed on instead. I suppose it will remain to be seen how long it will last over all, I'm sure we got the mileage we did because of the extended dry weather we experienced her in Wyoming this summer. Moisture I'm sure would wash away the Deer-off rather quickly otherwise.This bottle contained enough to cover 8 trees and 4 small shrubs. In a dry climate one dose can last up to two months, however I'm sure that in a wetter climate multiple re-applications would be necessary.
The product is easy to apply. I use it around some raised planters, the garden, and our dryer vent which leaves the house only about 8 inches above the ground (we've gotten critters in it before). It does seems to work (for us on rabbits) as the plant damage is lessened in the raised planters and garden. Our yard is fenced so deer are not a problem and I couldn't test it on them. This summer the product lasts longer as it was extremely dry. I do reapply after it rains otherwise it loses it effect. Good to use/try if exposed plants are getting visits by rabbits.
Here in Heber Springs we have many deer roaming through the town. I have a problem keeping them from munching on my bushes and stripping the bark from my trees. Other than that, I love to see them wandering around. I have tried other products that keep the deer off of my plants and shrubs, they work, but my poor hands pay the price after applying them. When I saw this product with the battery powered spray, I had to have it. It works and my hands no longer suffer. What's not to love?
I live in the country and there are a lot of deer and rabbits out here.  I use the Havahart Deer Off II around the outside of my house to keep these creatures from dining on my lovely wife's plants.  This sprayer is so easy to use and it even came with the needed batteries.  The best thing about this sprayer is I just depress the trigger and it sprays where ever I point the nozzle.  No more pumping my old sprayer.  The container with the repellent is not even heavy to carry around while I spray.  Lightweight is good.  Most importantly, it did not kill my wife's plants or the woodland creatures.  Also, the battery operated sprayer is reusable.  I will purchase the Havahart repellent for my sprayer when I run out, but I think the half gallon will last awhile.  This is a great product.
The sprayer works well and it's so convenient to use.  Since I have arthritis I love the battery power.I used this on my bird feeder and it's absolutely amazing.  Not a squirrel since and it doesn't hurt the birds.  Where has this been all my life?June 2012 update: The pump only worked the first time and since then I've had to put the stuff in another pump to deliver.  Even then, when we got a prolonged amount of dry weather and the grass was dry, NO-thing kept the deer from eating my hostas and flowers.  I guess anything is better than starving.  Ditto with the squirrels.  They eat their way through the product to get to the food.
The Havahart Deer Off Ready-To-Use Repellant applied a lot of repellent quickly. It was easy to set the direction of the spray. The battery option was a great addition to spraying to keep the deer from eating and/or trampling our plants and it made the application process a lot easier. It appears to work well as there has been no damage of plants after the first application.On the other hand, there was no wand with our bottle of repellant which made it impossible to apply a fine mist/spray (packaging implied it should have been part of what we received). The bottom compartment was hard to open and the nozzle we had to use because of having no wand dripped while applying.Update: This spray is doing a fantastic job of keeping the squirrels out of the birdfeeders.
The rabbits had me at my wits end having destroyed a large section of a newly sodded lawn. The rabbits were having their way with me and I was losing the battle. I started using Deer Off, reseeded the bare sections, and now my lawn is green again. The "power" nozzle makes spraying a large area a snap allowing me to cover the perimeter of the lawn quickly. A single treatment lasts about three to four days or until we have a rain. At the first sign of the little vermin I get out the sprayer and re-apply Deer Off. I might be applying it a little sooner than really needed but when I see the first rabbit droppings I do a new application.I like it much better than the other product I was using because it does not have to be mixed and does not leave my clothes and hands with an awful odor.
The battery-operated Havahart DO64MS Deer Off sprayer seems useful for those with weak hands, but at an additional cost of replacement batteries. This all-natural organic formula repels by taste and odor deer, rabbits, squirrels and possibly other nuisance animals unless they are starving or otherwise out of normal control, e.g. rabid.  This is not an industrial repellent working against anything that walks, but rather for the suburban home and garden use.  Its garlic, putrescent egg, and capsaicin are not offensive to all people and thus applicable not only in gardens, lawns, and landscaped areas, but also some basements, cellars, and storage.
This contains the same ingredients as dog repellant, and it works on a large variety of animals, not just deer, rabbits, and squirrels.  This white milky liquid contains rotten eggs, hot pepper, and garlic.  It doesn't smell much to humans when you apply it, so I was able to use it around the garden close to the house without any noticeable after effects.  I never liked battery operated disposable sprayers, though.  It works fine, but I could have sprayed it faster with more power if it was manually operated.
We built a home that is near a protected wildlife area and had a real problem (yard is unfenced) with deer, rabbits, and not sure what other wildlife, munching down our landscaping pretty much constantly. Fencing would ruin the natural setting we enjoy, but we were definitely losing the landscape wars before we found this repellant spray. After the first application we noticed a lot less damage, and now that we got real thorough with the coverage of the spray, we have NO nibbles at all - plus it keeps the wildlife deposits (dung) away from the house. Recommended!
We have been using this product to keep the gophers out of our garden.  We live on a farm and it really gets to be a problem.  This product is quick and easy to use.  The sprayer works well and felt like good quality.This did so well at keeping the gophers (we call them rock chucks here) out that we sprayed a wide perimeter around the chicken coop to see if we can keep the skunks out.  Last year we lost 10 chickens to skunks.  So far, so good.  I know that we have had skunks in the are but none have attempted to get my chickens so I am pretty happy about that.
I found that the motorized spray works great for me.  It is a lot easier to use than a squirt bottle as I am spraying the perimeter of my back yard and parts of my front flower beds.  I started a square foot garden this year and immediately had issues with rabbits coming in the back of my yard to eat a variety of green things.  After spraying with Deer Off II, I haven't seen any damage from rabbits.  Our area has squirrels, too, but as yet I haven't had problems with those.I suspect that I will need to reapply fairly often so I will update this review if I find the rabbits back or the squirrels coming to visit.
We put this in our vegetable garden about a week ago and so far no deer or rabbits. Our poor neighbors had all of their tomatoes and spinach eaten by the Deer and the Rabbits the day after we used this, so I would say that is a pretty good indication.  My husband said applying was easy and the sprayer worked great.  So at this point, the product does what it says and so I recommend.  If anything changes and the Deer show back up, I'll post another review.*Added bonus, I LOVE that the ingredients are all very natural or I wouldn't have used.
Deer Off is the first product that I have used that really does keep them off.  BUT, you need to reapply it on all new growth and new buds.  It does't stop them for a month or two (and it doesn't claim that it will).We finally had two growth periods before those little devils came in and clean out the next bloom crop!  But, I will still recommend it to others in my neighborhood.So, this is a good product but I'd like to see it work for at least 60 days or 2 bloom cycles.  That's why I gave it a 4 star rating.
WOW... the smell... will deter most critters straight away.... do NOT open this inside without expecting to fumigate yourself and do NOT apply before a rain to be effective.The active ingredients are Putrescent Whole Egg Solids (fermented rotten egg smell!), Capsaicin (hot peppers to deter nibbling), and Garlic (provides odor & nibbling deterrent) so think of highly rotten eggs with hot sauce and vampire deterrent LOL  Yes, it'll work for it's intended purposes.  There may be better and cheaper homemade treatments, but the battery powered trigger is really awesome and worth the price of the product if you spray many things and don't have/want to use a pressure/pump sprayer.
I have only recently started using this product. I didn't want to build a fence to keep rabbits out of my flower beds, so I decided to try this product. So far we are seeing good results. This seems to be a good inexpensive alternative to pricey unattractive fencing. This product is very easy to use, I really like the battery powered sprayer. No pumping or mixing, just squeeze the trigger, walk and let the spay do its job. Try this product before purchasing a fence for your gardens.
I have used the previous version of Deer Off so knew what to expect.  I loved the battery powered sprayer.  It is much easier than the old sprayer.  The Deer Off itself worked well.  We are in a drought and the deer are very hungry.  After I sprayed they left my flowers alone.  The only down side is the fact that after watering or rain (which we have not had) you have to re-spray.  I am having to water once a week just to keep things alive and that means that I have to re-spray.  I have quite a few flower beds so the Deer Off will only do a couple of spraying.
We don't get too many deer, so my testing can't confirm if this will help with deer issues or not, but I've used it to keep rabbits away from bushes in the winter and spring in Wisconsin.  We feed Squirrels and Rabbits and Raccoon, Opossums, and other small critters using feeders, mostly sunflower seeds, bird seed, and corn on the cob, so we get a lot of critters in the yard.  I like to feed them food, but not my bushes or young plants in the spring, so I've tried spraying this on the lower branches and they seam to stay away from those parts that have been sprayed - burning bushes especially.
This product is easy to use, and effectively repels vermin from my plants.The battery-powered sprayer includes four AA batteries required for operation. It has a three foot tube that extends from the lid, and I am able to hold the jug comfortably during application. The instructions mention a fine mist wand, but I didn't see one, but the main, twisting nozzle adjusts from stream to spray.The "natural" ingredients are clearly listed; however, these only make up 4.632% of the total solution. There are 95.368% of other undisclosed ingredients.
I've got some big redwood trees in my backyard and every year my squirrel population seems to grow.  They run around my yard eating flowers, digging up my grass (I used to think it was gophers), fighting with each other and creating a racket.Anyway, I figured I'd give this Havahart repellent a try.  I sprayed it around my yard.  It works, less squirrel activity around my yard.  They're either sticking to the redwood trees or moved on to my neighbor's house.So it was worth it for me, 5-stars.
It doesn't mention this in the product description (but does on the bottle), but this product is not supposed to be used on edible plants. Well, I'm a vegetable gardener with a rabbit problem, and if I can't spray it on things I'm going to eat, it's useless to me. This, despite saying it's safe for use around kids. Had I known this from the description, I never would have ordered it.It does get one star because my mom uses a product with the same active ingredient on her roses, and it does keep the deer away (although it stiiiiiinks).If I get brave enough to ignore the warning labels and spray it on the kale, I'll update.
Havahart Deer Off is easy to apply and seems to be keeping the critters from nibbling on all my flowering shrubs and plants in the yard.  I wouldn't suggest using this on anything I would consume, but all the ornamental plants that the animals seem to like I would spray this on.  We sprayed the Deer Off on some flowering and soon to be flowering plants, and I noticed that many of the blooms haven't been chomped off.  This is a huge feat, considering how every few days our plants would be nibbled on.  It's seems to be effective, and we'll be using this more in the spring when everyone seems to be eating stuff from our garden!  This stuff does stink a little, so wear clothes you don't care about when applying.  Recommended.
We live in the woods, deep in the woods and the deer like to play in our yard and snack on our shrubs and plants. So every year, my holly bushes get eaten back to nothing and the rhododendron get chewed to bits, even though they are right at the front door. I've often looked out my window to see the deer right below it snacking away and staring at me. Needless to say, our landscaping is rather scrubby.Deer Off has worked so far. I applied a good coating to the most nibbled plants and so far no one has snacked. The container comes with a battery powered pump. The batteries are included but I had to replace mine to get it to work. The spray nozzle is slow and doesn't put out a lot of solution so it takes awhile to get it to cover the leaves well. But eventually it all worked.So I give the solution 5 stars and 3 stars for the dispenser. The solution is more important so I think buying it wins out.
I sprayed this all around my house to deter ground squirrels.  Well first of all, it took a couple of minutes for the pump to prime instead of a couple of seconds.  Then, when I was about 3/4 of the way around my foundation the sprayer started to sputter and refused to spray any more even though there was still about 1/4 of a bottle left.And last but not least, the squirrels don't seem to be the least bit bothered by the smell.  Even my dogs don't seem to be bothered by the smell.  In fact, they like to lay down with their noses stuck under the door right where I sprayed the stuff hoping to keep the baby squirrels from squeezing under the door and eating all my dog kibble.Since I live in the burbs, I can't judge how effective it is against deer and rabbits but don't waste your money if you have squirrels.  This has absolutely NO effect on the little critters.
We have no deer problem, but squirrels drive our dog nuts and steal bird food from our feeders. I put this around the area and voila, no squirrels. Then it rained and they were back. So, spray after each rain.As for the battery-powered sprayer, what's the point, other than using more liquid than needed and thus perhaps making you buy more? Oh, cynical thought. What company would promote something that made you use more of their product than needed? A simple manual sprayer is fine here, unless you plan on spraying a huge area. Plus you really don't need much of this for it to work. A few ounces in a thin stream covered the perimeter of a couple hundred square feet for us.So yes, the stuff works, and no, you don't need the power sprayer version. Just buy it in bulk and put it in your own dollar store spray bottle with the nozzle set to long thin stream.
We were eager to try this product because we have a problem with squirrels coming onto the screened-in porch to snack and hide their nuts in the flower pots. Unfortunately the sprayer took a very long time to prime before it started spraying liquid. We actually thought the sprayer was defective because we heard the batteries whirring but no liquid was dispensed for five minutes or so. Once it got started it was great (though I'm not sure that anyone really needs a battery-powered sprayer because when the batteries die you're stuck with a non-functioning product).Anyway, we have now sprayed and will report back with an update on whether it keeps the critters away. One other note, we have used deer-repellant in the past. Normally the stuff smells horrendous. This one does not, so that's several points in its favor.
I have serious difficulty using most spray products due to serious arthritic hands, wrists, and fingers.  Normally, sprayer products are impossible or difficult for me to use.  This one is unique in that it is battery powered, and the sprayer doesn't cause me any pain during use.  That in itself was a huge plus, and the fact that it is working super well is just icing on the cake for me.  We have had a slight bit of rainfall, but the product is still working, and it's been several weeks.  Also, I have not noticed an overwhelming chemical smell, and that is a definite plus for me.
I live in the middle of the woods and have a lot of deer, never too much of a rabbit problem.  When I received my Deer Off I went outside and sprayed away, I didn't notice any bad odors that are so many times associated with repellents, which was a huge plus for me.The hand held sprayer is convenient and the off/on switch is rather nice as well.  I'm not sure if I sprayed too much but I did notice white splotches after the product dried on some of my plants.The deer have definitely stayed away, the down side is that we've had a LOT of rain here and I've had to spray too often for my taste, but that of course is not the products fault.  The only downfall is the price, but I guess it's worth it when you're able to keep your plants looking nice instead of feeding them all to the deer.Too bad it doesn't work on the chickens, they love my hostas.
I have my garden behind an six foot wire fence.  Unfortunately, one side of the fence is only 4 feet tall due to damage last winter.  I used this product as well as an electronic aid to keep the deer away.  The result was $60 in plantings and 40 hours of labor down the drain.  It didn't my local animals one bit!  Next year I will raise the fence and perhaps install a moat!  Actually, I have a neighbor who had good results with just playing a radio in the garden.  Guess deer do not appreciate good gospel music!
This product is fantastic! I've tried a variety of methods of keep the deer and rabbits from eating everything in my yard with various and inconsistent results. However, after using this product, nothing in my yard has been nibbled by the wildlife, and the  bonus is that it claims to be organic and it smells like pretty mild. It seemed to last about a week the first time before needing to be re-applied, and then after a rain shower, I re-applied...so far....and the motorized sprayer is a great addition!
I had high hopes for this product, as deer and squirrels tear my flower and vegetable gardens to shreds.  This product works as advertised, flawlessly - BUT it does not repel so-called wild critters.  Deer and squirrels initially were frightened by the sprayer action.  However, the repellant odor did not deter animals from eventually taking over my entire garden.I talked to a county fish and game official; he opined that urban animals are too accustomed to man and his many exotic sounds and smells  After three days or so, the deer simply ignored the spray of repellant.  They are persistent pests that won't hide in terror on seeing me.  Believe me I am quite scary.  I am proceeding to evaluate other tactics.Bambi and his kin are safe for the moment.
Havahart DO64MS Deer Off II Deer, Rabbit, and Squirrel Ready-to-Use Repellent with Battery Powered Sprayer. This product is easy to attach the sprayer nozzle on to the container. The sprayer reached a good distance and got into small places that other containers are not able to reach. We have noticed a decrease in the squirrels around our wood piles and bird feeders. There are still several chipmucks. I applied this around our pool deck to deter the deer from eating my plantings. My flowers seem to be lasting longer now. There is no strong order or unpleasant smell.
Well, I've tried everything I know to do, and so has my husband, to get the sprayer to spray.  The batteries are good and properly inserted, the motor is functioning but nothing will come out.  We've carefully followed the directions on priming, checked for kinks in the hose, turned the blue nozzle to to the "on" position and made sure the inlet was deeply immersed in the liquid.  Yet, it simply won't spray.Since the sprayer won't work, my next step is to pour the liquid into a hand sprayer and use the product as directed.  So, at this point I don't know how well the actual repellent repels unwanted animal critters, but the sprayer definitely doesn't function as it should.  Just thought the potential buyer should be aware of this before purchasing.  I will report back on the efficacy of the repellent after I finally get it applied.
I can't rate it for deer or rabbits. But we get squirrels in our attic, especially as Fall & Winter approach.I've patched the roof (twice now) where they chewed into the crawl space. I don't know if my roof work was the solution, or if the spray works, or both. I tend to think the spray helps because squirrels can actually chew through a 2x4 if they really want in. So I think the smell (or however it works) helps repel them.It's also super easy to apply, with the powerful battery powered sprayer. I can actually get the spray onto the 2nd story of my house from a little step ladder. The bottle comes with batteries, and the sprayer works great. And I really love that it's non-toxic, so if some of it drifts into the yard, it's no big deal.
I was ready to protect some plants that have become deer favorites on our yard.I unpacked the deer off, started reading the description, and found the warning that left me puzzled:I am paraphrasing but it goes something like:"Apply to just a portion of your plants first and wait a few days. Product may kill some plants"This stopped me from applying the product, since I wanted to do a little more research before applying it after reading such warning. Unfortunately the deers came the very next morning and ate most of what I wanted to protect. Obviously it was bad timing, but I wanted to let others be aware that the product warns us that it might kill the plants.It did not seem to damage the plants when I did apply it, but the warning itself leaves me wondering if it's something I want in my plants.As for the product itself, the jury is still out and I will update it later this summer after more plants bloom.
If you live in a rural area, you know how much damage deer can do to a garden. Havahart repellents are the best on the market and this one is no different. One of the best features of this repellent is the built in sprayer. This allows you to use it the moment you notice damage and without having to mix up anything.Another great feature is that there are no harsh chemicals involved. Just garlic, eggs and hot pepper capsaicin. This repels both by scent and taste. It is safe around children and pets and long lasting, good for up to 3 months.
Just like other animal repellants (and I've tried many), the Havahart repellant (Havahart also make traps) fails to deliver.The battery operated sprayer is a toy, so good luck getting it to work reliably.The odor is similar to other products. In fact, you can make your own with rotten egg and hot pepper.But to focus on the core objective: repelling critters -- I did not see any noticeable drop in the amount my flowers and vegetables. Deer, squirrels and rabbits seem minimally discouraged.
I did the perimeter of my home garden which in previous year had been a feeding ground for the small deer in my area.  So far, I haven't had any problems with deer. The two rabbits in the are stay away too.  I don't really care about squirrels.The battery powered sprayer is a nice feature.  It's much better than having to pump it by hand or use a trigger.The scent isn't too bad and the product lasts at least 6-8 weeks.Keep in mind that a little goes a long way.
I was about to give up on this, until the sprayer inexplicably decided to work... no worries then.  So I didn't use Deer Off over every garden on my priority, I thought we'd get a better sense of its effectiveness if I left some areas untouched.  The result, I've been watching a mother doe and her fawn visit my yard now for the past two weeks, however any "munch damage" has been confined to the control group beds that are in the back of the property.  The more ornamental flower beds in the front have survived unscathed.  And to underscore that effectiveness, those protected flower beds are heavily populated with hosta... a whitetail deer's most delightful treat in this neck of the woods.It would appear that this works so well that I can forgive the recalcitrant sprayer.
I mostly wanted this for a house in PA that has rabbits eating the gardens and flowers every day, they are everywhere.  We have tried other sprays that have not really worked, or worked for a day or two and then the animals were back eating the leaves.  What I really liked about this Havahart repellant is that it works for deer, rabbits and squirrels, I don't need 3 different things.  It is very convenient with its own spray hose thing attached to it.  Very easy and convenient.
I read a few reviews before using this. I, too, had hoped I could spray it around my yard..as in..around the whole perimeter of the yard..to keep critters OUT completely! Instead, I sprayed it on plants directly.I have lived in this house for nearly 20 years and we did not have a deer or squirrel (or rabbit) problem until two years ago. Now, it's like someone is flying them in!! Now boarding, all critters, on route to Sheri's for the summer!  So, I used this Havahart on my pretty shrubs etc and it's working perfectly! They approach, taste..yuck yuck, and scamper off to my neighbor's pretty shrubs and trees! Yeah! I would tell my neighbors about this, but I don't want to mess with a good thing. ;0)
I have used this trying to rid my property of the cute, but pesky rabbits and squirrels. I have sprayed heavily and find that it does keep the rabbits away but it does NOTHING for the squirrels!!! I really was hoping it would do something to keep the squirrels away. We also saw a racoon walking through an area that I sprayed heavily. I don't know how it works for deer as it is very rare we see a deer around our property these days.  If your problem is with rabbits, then this is probably going to help, but if you have a squirrel problem, I hope you have better results than me.
I have to say I finally got this little critters from running anywhere but in the tree.I was tired of them in my gardens and running all night on my roof. When you set up a perimeter of where you do not want the Deer, Raccoons or Squirrels to go. Spray and they will not come in that area. I sprayed and it worked just great. after thirty days I sprayed again, you do not have to use a lot.If you do not have a lot of rain it will last longer, overall good product.
I have tried lots of different types of animal repellents, but to no avail! This one works pretty well! I did notice, however, even in dry weather, that it didn't last quite as long as I would have liked (only about 4-5 days) before I had to reapply.The sprayer takes a little getting used to since it's a powered sprayer, but once you figure out what direction to aim it and how long/hard to squeeze the trigger, it is a breeze and beats the hand cramp you get from normal self-squeeze sprays!Overall, it works a little better than the other products out there, but it still is not the "magic potion" we've all been hoping for!
During the fall, the squirrels dig up all the plants in my small backyard, and sit on my fence and throw black walnut shells against the white paint on my garage, staining it deeply.  I ignored this product for a long time assuming it was toxic and because I did not want to get rid of the squirrels completely.  Once I realized it really was a safe mix that wouldn't kill everything, I thought it would be nice to try.  And it is.  I can put a very small amount on boxed plants and on my fence without scaring the squirrels out of the yard completely; the power of the black walnut tree overcomes all.
I have tried pretty much every kind of deer management products on the market, and these repellents are marginally useful at best.Most repellents smell strongly and wash away after even a light drizzle. This product tries to correct these shortcomings. It does stay on much longer and the smell is much fainter, but herein lies the problem: it does not deter deer very well. Eventually, only the corner of my garden protected by theBird-X YG Yard Gard Ultrasonic Animal Repellerremains completely unmolested.I do like the battery-powered sprayer and plan to keep it for the regular repellents after this bottle is used up.
Every winter when the greenery turns brown the rabbits decide that my new lilac bushes and new grape vines are quite the tasty alternative.  So when I tried Deer Off I was thrilled to find that they stopped the nibbling.  The sprayer is easy to use and I love that I don't have to purchase a sprayer separately... that's a huge plus.  Note that you can't use this on plants you are going to eat; so while it should be okay to spray the base of my vineyard; eventually I am not going to be able to use it on the upper portions for deer, etc...
I have a squirrel problem 3 seasons out of the year because they try to build nests under my awning and continually pick at my gutters and tear up the flowers. I found this to be pretty effective in getting rid of them..but only for a few days before I have to spray again, so the company claim that it can last for months at a time is bogus. Unfortunately the ingredients aren't strong enough to get rid of them for longer. I didn't notice any smell from the product either which is nice, as is the battery operated sprayer so your hand doesn't get tired. This product is not weather resistant either as it claims - the effectiveness of the ingredients wears off even quicker after a rainstorm. Also at 30 some dollars a bottle, I can't say I'd buy it again for such a short window of squirrel relief since I have to apply it every few days. Overall, I wasn't that impressed with it.
We live next to a National Park and often get deer in the area.  The major perk of this product is the sprayer, it is convenient to use.  I did notice less deer after using the product, but it did not deter all of them...so it's hard to judge whether it was just a time where we had less deer coming or the product actually worked. Because I live in an area that sees rain often, it is not cost-effective for me to use the product long term unless there is a future drop in price.
We have a lot of rabbits around our house. Sometimes we don't mind them, but sometimes they're a bit of a nuisance, eating our vegetables, pooping on our grass and (more recently) burrowing under our house.I got this because I heard good things about Deer Off in general and  love the battery-powered delivery system (as opposed to the pump I'm used to with other products).I also have 5 young kids, and I appreciated that this product is supposed to be safe around them!Good product overall.
The DEER OFF is relatively easy to use.  I do wear gloves though because absorption of the chemicals isn't a good idea, and occasionally there is drippage in addition to just wind dispersal.I used this product on my front garden, and honestly the results weren't conclusive.  Some plants seemed to benefit.  Others did not.I will give it another season to see if I can narrow in on effectiveness.  BUT I will note that while I saw bunny droppings in the yard, I have not seen them nibbling in the garden proper.
We don't have a deer problem but this product seems to work for squirrel and raccoon problems. We've also had problems with our cat scratching the paint off of our back door when he is anticipating his meal. I sprayed some of this on the back door and he has not touched it! I thought the battery powered pump was a little ridiculous but realize that some people may actually need that if they have problems with their hands. It seems to work just fine although you have to hold the trigger in for a while before it starts to spray.
As a landscape architect, I'm always looking for a kind yet effective way to keep bunnies and squirrels from destroying my client's gardens. I've gone the utterly "Old School" route, using dog fur, dried blood meal and Tabasco sauce, with very limited results. The rabbits in particular were destroying customer's perennial beds, mowing them down to nothing. I ordered this product, based on reviews and the fact that it had a battery powered sprayer...woo-hoo! I then sprayed what was remaining in the gardens and the hydrangeas, which seem to be a bunny food. Voila! Like magic, the remaining bits of the garden were saved and my clients were thrilled! I also have tried this on emerging tulips (just as they show their bud poking up) and that also saves them from the bunnies and the squirrels. LOVE the motorized sprayer! When you have a large area to cover, it sure saves the pain of application.
I tried this product and it does appear to be somewhat effective at deterring critters from bothering garden and flower areas for a while. It turns out to not be practical for my needs because of the relatively limited working time, and the relatively large expense of the product. I can not afford to continue to apply this product to garden and flower beds. The area I live in is experiencing a drought so a garden is a particularly attractive feeding ground for animals, so the product might work better in areas where animals are not so stressed to find food.
The actual fluid may very well be working - it's hard to tell.  My problem is with the motorized sprayer - it's more trouble than it's worth.  The alkaline AA batteries that came with it weren't producing any spray, so I replaced 'em with rechargeables.  This produced a sputtering short-range squirting.I may try John Casey's fix but honestly, I'd prefer to just pour the contents into an old squeeze-sprayer and try it that way.As to the fluid's effectiveness - well, *I* can't smell anything, but the DOG can, so he has added his own ingredients to the mix.  We'll see how THAT works out!.
For small areas, this battery-powered sprayer is a great, lightweight improvement over the pump sprayers . After spraying our pergola, all squirrels abandoned it - overnight!  We do have a metal squirrel proof feeder which effectively keeps away all squirrels.  We know this because we saw dozens of squirrels try to feed from it, crash to the ground, and then give up trying.  This spray will be very useful when we start feeding the birds again next Fall.  I plan to spray the plastic finch feeder to keep squirrels from chewing on it.  They are welcome to enjoy the seeds we leave on the ground for large birds.This easy-to-carry and use sprayer is also perfect for spraying small areas of flowers or a vegetable garden against deer. I will test it on rabbits as soon as they appear in our vegetable garden.
I'm using this for small critters - rabbits and squirrels. We have a large back yard - it's fenced in, but rabbits ignore large fences, and squirrels just look and laugh. Or chitter. When our garden is in full bloom these critters must see an invisible "salad bar" sign. So I sprayed the plants with Deer Off. There was a definite drop off in plant damage.I can take or leave the battery powered sprayer. It works well, but it's another set of batteries to die over the Winter (Batteries are included.) I prefer the containers with the pump that pressurizes the chamber and lets you spray for almost a minute.One thing I am going to try - Squirrels destroy our Halloween pumpkins, carved or not (the pumpkins, not the squirrels.) They love the taste of that Golden Squash. I'm going to spray the pumpkins with Deer Off and see what happens. I'll update this once I try that.
The battery powered sprayer is a neat little bonus with this repellent and very welcome to these arthritic hands.It does make application much easier.  Here in Colorado this year we've had feast and famine when it comes to rain.  We're faring better than the middle of the country certainly and my garden has been pretty productive.  But the squirrels and rabbits have wreaked their havoc so I decided to use some of this stuff and it works.  I've had to make three applications because of heavy sporadic downpours, but it does deter the little pests and they stay clear.  I would recommend it and the powered sprayer (just be sure to do your maintenance so the sprayer doesn't become clogged) really is much simpler to use than pump...pump...pump....I would say buy it to any gardener who asked.
We like this product as it seems to be keeping away the squirrels from the garden and it's keeping the bird feeder safe for the birds!We really love the sprayer in this repellent.  It does make a bit of an irritating noise while it's working, but that's not a big deal.  It sprays out a couple feet.  The battery powered sprayer made using this really easy.  It came with batteries, but the batteries were dead.We don't get deer or rabbits in our yard so I don't know how this works on them.  Overall, this is a good product to keep the squirrels away from our yard!
Arrived in record time with easy to follow instructions and sprayer - even had batteries included that still had a charge.  I've used mixes in the past so this was not messy as well as easy and quick to spray on those new sprouts coming up.Sprayed two days ago and haven't seen any damage from rabbits or deer yet.  Time will tell though - I'll see how long the new plants go untouched, how often I have to spray and how long it lasts.  The 'mix' that I use has an AWFUL smell -- I didn't notice that with this so time will tell how well it works and I have my doubts.One thing about it - it's a pleasure not having to pump air into the sprayer.  This is going to be a reusable, lightweight container for me.
Living in a rural area, I have an ongoing fight with trying to keep deer, rabbits, and a few other critters out of my garden areas. I've tried everything from human hair to mothballs, and none seem very effective for long, if at all. Havahard Deer Off seems to reduce the problem better than so-called home remedies, though even this isn't perfect. It washes off easily and needs to be reapplied frequently. Not really a good solution if you water the area daily, have a few nights of heavy dew, or live where it rains frequently. Of course this is going to be the case with anything that is topically aplied, and isn't really a fault of this or any other product like it, it's just the way things work. Still, it is a great aid for "training" the critters to stay away from those areas.
I have used the Havahart products before and have always found them to be very effective in keeping the plant eaters at bay in my yard.Really the biggest hassle was that I had to spray so many things that my hand would get sore and stiff and I usually had to turn the job over to hubby about 1/2 way through.That's why I was so eager to try the power sprayer. With the battery charged sprayer using it on all the areas that my yard needs it has been so easy! The great repellant keeps the critters away and the great spray system means that my hands don't get sore and I don't have to look for help or talk my self out of doing the applications! Thanks Havahart for being so ingenious!
The mixture works, and it's nothing too scary, but it has it's limits.First, it's not really for vegetables, due to its' smell/composition.  That being said, it totally worked on decorative plants.  Deer came and left without a nibble.  For some, this is a great scenario.  For others, well the nearby but unsprayed veggies, not so much.  There was an overall reduction however.Second, it's not too cheap.  It's not the priciest solution, but it's not that cheap either.For a smallish ornamental garden, this is a great solution.  For vegetable gardens, maybe not.Overall it's not bad, and the sprayer is the real deal.  I loved it.
But I HATE the way they all flock to the oak trees on our property, and dig up the lawn trying to save the acorn bounty. I've used other Havahart products with a good level of success, so was hoping this one would be the same.It is! The sprayer worked great to cover a lot of area, and I've noticed a better lawn. While I still see the critters, especially after a good rain, my lawn is the proof of fewer varmints. While it is not 'odorless' as it claims, there is very little scent.Thanks, Havahart!
We moved to a rural property last year. We have deer, jack rabbits, wild turkeys and more.  It's been a challenge to keep them away from the roses and other flowers around the house. We also have a garden, but we have a 'deer fence' around it.I've used Deer Off on the rose and other flowers, and around the garden fence, to discourage the rabbits and squirrels from going under. I don't have a lot growing yet, it's still early, but it does seem to be helping. I'm so glad I have this for when the veggie garden gets going!  I do like the battery powered sprayer as well.It's very strong smelling when you first spray it, it uses garlic, hot pepper and rotten egg scents to keep the animals away. And I like that as we have dry summers, I won't have to reapply that often. Recommended.
The battery-operated pump is worth the price! No more hand cramps!pre-mixed solution means no messy measuring and mixing. Easy!Will it keep deer away?  This year has been pretty harsh in my area on deer, and they are eating everything, even the plants that deer are supposed to not like (hostas etc.)  I live in a rather rural area with three acres, so deer frequent my back yard. They hop right over the fence.  They have still nibbled a bit on what plants were left, but this stuff definitely steered them to other un-sprayed plants.Be sure you are up-wind when you spray. The stuff smells nasty (like rotten eggs.)
We have a severe problem with deer at our house, which is in a heavily wooded area. Deer would come in and chew on many of the plants, even those that deer are not supposed to like.  We have tried many kinds of deer repellent, with poor results so far.  The Havahart Deer Off, applied to some plants that the deer seemed particularly attracted to, did reduce grazing.  I see that some people complain of the smell, but I didn't really notice anything.  The primary ingredient is eggs.The battery-powered sprayer worked well, though the assembly instructions were not as clear as I would have liked.
I have used other deer repellent products and found most to be messy to apply and the most effective one I have ever used leaves a whitish coating on the leaves of the flowers, detracting from their appearance. This one is clear and the battery operated sprayer made application a breeze! So far it seems to be working but because my deer graze in different areas every day/night I can't be sure until I actually see them reacting to this product. That could be quite some time before I can testify to their reaction to it but when and if it happens I will add to this review.
I have a bird feeder on top of a 10' pole, which I thoroughly soaked the Havahard Deer Off.  5 minutes later a squirrel climbed up the pole through the Deer Off.  I chased the squirrel away, and he was back in another 5 minutes.  The Deer Off did not even slow him down.What DOES work for me is greasing the pole with automotive grease weekly.  I had hoped that I could apply the Deer Off less frequently.  I also worry about poisoning the squirrels, since they obviously remove the grease from the pole physically, on their underbellies, and then lick it off.
I had something eating my sunflowers that are starting to pop up, so I sprayed this stuff around.  I have deer, possum, rabbits, raccoons and even coyotes lurking around the area, so I have no idea which was the culprit.  Since I sprayed, my sunflowers have been left alone, but whether or not that was because of the "Deer Off" stuff or not is hard to tell.  But I will give the stuff the benefit of the doubt and say it works and give it a four star rating.  However, more testing will be necessary to be sure.The battery powered squinter is pretty cool, but I'd rather just have a squeeze handle if that would save me money.
This is a pricey solution - literally and figuratively - for people looking to rid their lawns and gardens of deer, rabbits, and other pesky critters. Part of the reason for that cost, however, is the inclusion of a surprisingly handy battery powered sprayer. Potential buyers might wonder if something like that is worth the extra cost, and I would say that for anybody with severe arthritis or other issues that make spraying or sprinkling this kind of product a painful exercise, the expense is worth it. The sprayer works very well, and it not only reduces the effort involved in spraying the repellent, it makes the job go a lot faster. Just be prepared to spend a little extra money on batteries - this thing will use a lot of them over the course of an outdoor season.
I have given this product just a preliminary test and so far so good. The sprayer works very well and is very easy to spray in a jet or mist. I have used this brand of product for deer previously and it seems to work. What I have tried this time is spraying around the pine tree trunk about 5 feet up and down all the way around and then sprayed where the bird feeder is hung from a tree branch by a chain. I could shoot the sprayer up to the branch without a ladder. It has been about a week and so far no squirrels in the feeder. I have a few apple trees that need winter protection but it will be months before results will be known for the apple trees. So far the Havahart DO64MS seems to work as advertized.
Havahart's Deer Off Repellent is an excellent choice for those looking for a kid and pet-safe deterrent for unwanted deer, rabbits, and squirrels. Deer Off features a battery-powered sprayer, making it simple and easy to use.The product features a dual-action all-natural deterrent, largely made of garlic, that rebels pests with both scent and taste. The 64 oz. bottle will protect up to 1,000 square feet. The manufacturer claims that the repellent will last up to three months with a single application. Both the Organic Materials Review Institute and the USDA have approved the product for organic gardening.While three months haven't gone by, I can say that the product has seemed to have kept the deer away from some of our garden's prized possessions. The battery-powered sprayer is simple to use - there's no need to mix or pump.
Easy to use and apply, this is a great way to keep deer and other woodland pests away from your prized garden items.Setup is a snap, simply connect the trigger to the bottle, and begin applying. It is batter operated so simply pulling the trigger sends a steady stream of the product, an adjustable nozzle allows you to apply anything from a light mist to sharp stream. It goes on easily, though after several days, especially after rain, you would have to reapply it. It contains hot pepper extracts so there is a bit of a smell associated with it, it is tolerable, especially since you know that smell means the sweet smell of deterred deer.
I've been having a horrible problem with squirrels lately.  They dig up the garden, chew up my iris bulbs, and have been systematically gnawing away at my attic vents.I sprayed the garden with the Deer Off II  repellent and it seems to keep the little fiends away from the plants, but no such luck with the house.  I sprayed the wooden attic vents but they still keep chewing away at them.  I also sprayed it on the wooden fence (which they use to hop onto the roof of the house), but they still scamper across it without noticing the spray.Oh well, at least the repellent is keeping them out of the garden.  My roses and irises are safe.
I really liked using this one..with the powered sprayer it made a huge difference in getting all my bushes, garden fencing, hanging plants, etc, sprayed without getting a sore, worn out hand!  Usually I also get the stinky spray all over my hand too from pumping the nozzle head..not this time!  I also like the fact that I don't have to mix anything.  This product says water repellent so we will see as I don't get rain all that frequently.  I do know that I haven't had anymore nibbling from deer for a week and whatever was trying to tunnel into my garden seems to have given up, we will see!  I really like the battery powered sprayer :)
A few years ago our neighborhood was inveded bu bunnies.  At first it was cute to see them on our lawn; the kids loved them.  But after seeing the dead patches they left, the bunnies had to go.  We have tried many different solutions with varying degrees of effectiveness.  This spray works well and is easy to apply.  We have tried some liquids that reeked, but this one is not bad.  Simple to apply and lasts a decent amount of time.  Since our Labrador thinks the bunnies are cuddle toys, and our Bassett Hound isn't fast enough to catch them; I think we will be sticking to Deer Off (or a pellet gun).
What these products are is a deterrent. That means it hopefully keeps many of your local population at bay to protect your trees, plants, veggies, etc. These sprays are best used with other methods like chicken wire, etc. You also have to realize that you will still lose some stuff to these little critters but the idea is to limit that loss.In that case, I think Deer Off II works as well as any other critter off spray I have tried. These are best reapplied every 45-60 days (regardless of what they advertise since that is a "up to" day count). The spray didn't seem any better than past products but I did appreciate the fact that you don't have to mix it or hurt your thumb spraying due to the battery powered sprayer.I would recommend this product.
This sprayer required no real assembly, batteries are included.I went out in the back yard to spray these huge hostas that the deer have been feasting on.The spray was easy and smooth and even after a week with a light rain 2 days after I sprayed there are no new chomp marks.  So other than it would be nice to have a refill to use in the sprayer, since it continues to work, since it seems a waste to keep buying a sprayer I'm very happy with this product.
We back up to woods so I was not sure if it was deer, ground hogs or rabbits, but our squash plants were getting decimated.  After spraying this on the leaves (but not the squash) the damage stopped.  Although I consider the ingredients organic, I can't imagine the residue would taste good on your squash.One complaint - common with other reviewers - is that the sprayer gives a weak stream.  For my targeted purposes (Squash leaves but not the blossom or squash) it worked out OK, but I could see this being a major pain if you were, for example, spraying down a hydrangea bush or other large plant.
I use those for the second season now for my potted lime and blood orange trees.be aware that one hole spuke is to much for most potted citrus fruits, so I broke them in half at the beginning of the season and used them 3 months apart. When i used a whole spike the first year I had heavy but thin growth and some discolored leaves. I made some pictures and send them to a forum and got told of because I overfed the poor buggers. So, break them into pieces if your pots arent that big.....Aside of that a very convenient way of fertilizing.ANother small tip,http://www.amazon.com/Bayer-701285B-Disease-Concentrate-32-Ounce/dp/B000VZQ3FU/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1404267488&sr;=8-2&keywords;=bayer+mite+controlkeeps the ugly buggers and sicknesses away!Hope your trees grow as beautiful as mine!
Winter is coming full-force in Upstate NY and I was happy to find such a great, sturdy and ergonomic shovel on Amazon.This shovel is strong and easy to use.  The handle is wide enough to accommodate a thick ragg wool glove with ease.  The wear strip is a nice extra when shoveling ice and hitting blacktop or concrete.  I have a much cheaper shovel and don't trust it half as much as this one.  The ergo design does help your back when lifting and pushing.If you need a shovel and are thinking about it, buy this one -- it's great for fluffy and slushy snow.  The capacity is pretty large -- so be mindful of your back.
I bought this shovel from Amazon in December to be prepared for when the snowfall comes this season. My neighbor had one of these and loved the way it worked and how it made the job easier. I had to have it so I actually bought two. Little did I know that while I was Christmas shopping at Target I noticed them hanging there. Color is different but it's the same one. Same manufacturer and same model number. They have it for $20 bucks. I bought mine for $27 and change for each here and noticed they have increased in price since then. Sometimes its better to get out of the house and shop around. You might get luckier than the deals you find from behind that monitor.
I've had two of these shovels so far because I wear them out.  To make them easier to use, I drill the rivets holding the metal blade on so that I can remove the blade all together.  Plastic on concrete or brick is MUCH easier to push, and slide and it doesn't grab, which IMO causes more muscle strain than anything.  Sure, they wear out faster, but I still get 5-6 good seasons out of them.If you have issues pushing it, do as I stated above.  It makes a good shovel great!
I already had some sprinkler stands...which I thought were good, but after I received this Yard Butler sprinkler stand, I realize that they're kind of junky.First, this Yard Butler has the hose nut tightener built in, meaning that when hooking up the hose, you spin the connector, and it screws to connect to the hose.  My other stand makes you spin the entire stand to connect to hose, which I now realize is ridiculous.Also, this stand, as you can see in the picture, has two connections with the dirt you're putting it in...if you have somewhat soft soil and/or incredible water pressure, this is also handy.  (Again, with my other stand, it's a single stake that you press into the dirt, and when turning on the water, the initial burst often makes the entire stand jerk to an undesired angle.)So all in all, this Yard Butler is better than my other stands, is quite high quality, and does a great job.  Would recommend!
I received this Yard Butler Sprinkler Stand as part of Vine product reviewing. I had read a review of the unit before I ordered it about the threads in the stand being a problem. Yes they are a problem.  As I tried to put in the sprinkler that I had just purchased, I was very careful, I found that the sprinkler would not go in straight and the sprinkler end thread was being ruined. I looked at the threads in the Yard Butler and they were  clearly not tapped properly. If I would have continued it would have ruined my sprinkler head. It was not a question of lining them up, the Yard butler threads were bad.Since I have the tools and knowledge of threading  and tapping pipe, I re-did the Yard butler threads and it accepted the sprinkler and works fine. The problem is that most people who would buy this expect it to work without having to machine the unit to make it right.
I bought this feeder for the cardinals; they prefer platform feeders to perches. I would have given this feeder a 5-star rating IF the roof were closer to the platform. The roof is so high that pigeons and squirrels can EASILY get in. (Yes, I put a baffle on the pole, but the squirrels still manage to get in the feeder.) The cardinals don't use it very often because of the pigeons and squirrels. Also, it's very awkward getting the roof back on after cleaning (you have to dismantle the feeder in order to clean it.) What I do like is that the squirrels have not tried to chew it yet because the feeder is metal.
I have about an acre of land and it feels like I am pruning much of the time.  It was a strenuous and disheartening process as my hand always hurt badly afterwards, and the process of pruning was such a slow one, as it was hard to close the shears.Enter the Fiskars power gear soft grip pruner...wow!This little guy makes pruning so easy, with the new mechanism they have put in it.  I can now do my entire garden in a day and I have no pain in my hand!  To me, this is one of the best tools I have ever found as it allows me to be in my garden and do what I love.If you have any hand, back or strength issue, these are for you.  Even if you do not, these are excellent clippers!There are a couple videos in the reviews that really show you what they do.  Do not hesitate if you are looking for a pruner.  Have fun!
I needed a better pair of pruners. I had a pair that the handles had to open further than my hands could open just to get the blades to open up enough for pruning. These are way better and easier to manage. They are also light weight and have a more comfortable grip. I have to agree with another reviewer in that they don't work the same for left handed people. I thin it has something to do with the bottom handle that twists slightly when you squeeze the handles together.These are super sharp and one thing I like about them is that when your cutting a branch they don't jam up and you get the branch wedged sideways in-between the blades. Fiskars make great scissors and now i can say great pruners too.
Bypass are being used to cut anything " green" within it's cutting capability, and because when you squeeze and cut, the handle you pull up also rotates to reduce figer fatigue, you might lose grip when wearing gloves, so remember to use this line of pruner bare handed, cuts great under normal posture, also with palm down position, not so when palm facing up, so you switching hands to do the job, and that's when you will find out the power gear handle only rotates clockwise, and the design is not useful in your left hand, so left hand user beware.
Have to say i have not used this yet.But taking itout of te boxi wa like wow frigen awesome! Totally is better than describedand pictured.....Cant wait to use it.Ivehad spider mites and the plants need t be sprayed with killig agents yes purchased thru amazon......And to nevr hav bugsagain i plan on spraying them a couiple times to prevent any invading my crop again.......But when i used acnventinal sprayer gt itall over myself gtting undeneath leaves which is a must......Soooooo i love this prouduct and cat wait to use it!
This is a well made sprayer with a comfortable balanced feel when spraying. Some smaller sprayer are awkward to use, but this makes spraying a breeze. The spray is fine and even, it delivers a nice constant spray. It is possible to lock the spray trigger in an open position, I'm not sure how useful this is given the need to pump the handle every 10 seconds, but some may find it useful.The user pump the handle on the top and once pressure is obtained you press the trigger located above the handle with your thumb; spray time is about 10 seconds between pumping.One reviewer commented on the opening being too small, but I do not find this is the case. It was more than adequate to fill the 1 gallon tank without spilling anything.
Upside-down is the way to go. The house finches are completely baffled by this feeder while the goldfinches happily flop over to get their seed.As another reviewer said, squirrels won't touch thistle, but they do like the seed mixes. This feeder is all plastic, including the perches, unlike more expensive feeders that have metal perches. The squirrels will chew the plastic perches right off. Also, the plastic bottom of the feeder is held in only by a tiny tab and notch, so there's a good chance of its falling out.In short, if this feeder lasts a couple of months that's about all one can expect. If you want a more durable feeder, pay more for a better built model!
This gold finch feeder is a blast!  These little cuties do hang upside down to feed and I find it very entertaining to watch.  There is an extra benefit to this feeder...the little holes make it just about impossible for the large birds to steal the food.  Oh yea, the feeder is made out of plastic as well as the perches, but I have absolutely no complaints in regards to the quality of the feeder for the money.  Just use common sense for leaving it out under certain weather circumstances...it cannot tolerate below freezing temperatures.
This is my 3rd one of these.  I like the way it attracts ONLY Gold finches.  Normal finch feeders attract too many house finches for my taste.  These things last about 3-4 years, then the plastic gets a bit brittle.  Wish they were a tad more durable.  But, it is inexpesive and it WORKS.  Thistle is getting a bit expensive.  I have found that I can make it last longer by sliding the perches over to one side or the other and metering how many birds I get at a time, especially limiting the feeding on the backside facing away from me.  I still get plenty of goldfinch entertainment.  It is kind of like your own private Parakeet aviary.
The steel handle is welded to the blade.  It is oval shaped with the long axis is the direction of greatest force to allow a comfortable grip at the same time that you can pry it hard without damage.  The handle, instead of just being attached at the top of the blade, is welded both to the top and to the middle of the blade, distributing the force evenly.  The metal handle makes it heavier than an ordinary shovel but my wife says that the extra weight helps it penetrate the soil better so she likes it.  The top of the blade is wide so it is easy to stand on it to force it into the soil.  It is made in China.
The image seems to show a black rubberized grip further down on the handle, mine doesn't have that.  It is however very very strong, as an example we used it to lever up a rather large cement fountain base full of water so we could level it out, and the shovel was a champ(maybe not smart but it was the only tool for the job).  I will say that this shovel is heavy, heavier than the standard wood handled ones.  For light gardening I will still need to order one not quite so serious.
I am impressed with this shovel.  I just dug a couple large tree planting holes in our backyard with it and it worked great.  I like the all steel handle - don't have to worry about breaking like a wood one.  The step edges on the top of the shovel are large and really let you sink your weight onto it.  The shovel blade is large and sharp (I know since I just nicked a service cable in our backyard and severed it before I knew what had happened).  Being all steel, it is a bit on the heavy side but I'd prefer to have a bit more weight and an indestructible shovel than a cheap lightweight one that is going to break in a year or two.
1- it is slightly heavier than most shovels.  it has an stainless handle which is resilient, and slightly heavier than most.2- the "step", which is a horizontal plane about an inch wide, makes it very comfortable to step on even when wearing flimsy sneakers instead of work boots.  This comes in handy for the quick task when you're not really "gearing up" for a full day's worth of yard work.3- it is sharp, and remains sharp.  I've been using mine for a year, and it hasn't dulled.  We have very rocky and very clay ground and this drives right through the toughest of ground4- the all stainless construction makes it tough and resilient to bending when I pry big rocks out of the ground.  no worries about snapping a handle like with wood ones.
Was so excited to get this as I have a lot of volunteer oaks to dig up and a pine I want to move so when it arrived today I pounced on the box and went to town on the pine. My well pump has a problem so I wasn't able to soften up the very hard and dry ground but was still able to dig down pretty deep in stages and the ledge is awesome. My weight wasn't much help with the very dry dirt but it helped a bit and was pretty easy to find my balance on the ledge. The shovel has a great weight, it is a little heavy but imo that's a good thing. I'm not that strong and was able to handle this shovel very easily and although it is long it is also pretty easy to maneuver. Seems built to last, a huge upgrade to the standard.
As with the transplanting spade that I just reviewed, this shovel is excellent. It's built so strong, I can't imagine it wearing out or damaging it in any way.If I have any complaint, it's that the shovel is heavy. That heft makes it possible to use it for leveraging anything out of the ground without worry of damage, but it also means that simple tasks like moving gravel or digging plants in soft soil will be more strenuous than it would be with a lighter shovel that would be just as good at such light tasks.That's a minor issue with an excellent hand tool. After my good experience, I bought one for my dad as a gift, which is high praise in my book.
Finally had an occasion to bring out my Loppers after some heavy wind knocked down a big limb. I am a 66 year old female and admit I was a little afraid but using the Loppers was as easy as advertised. What really impressed me was how little noise was produced. I was expecting the usual loud chainsaw racket. If I needed to use them for an extending period of time I would need a rest because of the weight, but for ten or fifteen minutes my arms held up  just fine and the limb was cut in short order. Trimmed a dead limb on a holly tree while I was at it. This is a great addition to my yard equipment arsenal.
I have been using this for over a year and it has cut through all my branches and small shrubs without any issues. It makes very quick work of anything.  Anyone can use it, my wife cut many branches and I pulled on them.  Not always a clean cut when stressing the branch by pulling down, but 95% of the time I have clean cuts.One issue is just the cord like all plug-in electric tools, just put it over your shoulder to keep it away from being cut.Don't forget chain oil, don't let it get dried out.I let my father borrow mine and was lucky to get it back so I had to buy him one.  He took an all day job removing dead lilac bushes and turned it into an hour job cutting it down with this.
OK, I am a sucker for gadgets and this one intrigued me.  I had read about it in a gardening publication.  The alligator lopper by Black and Decker is much, much better than I ever imagined.  It cuts through a 3 inch branch like a hot knife through butter.  Wow, this thing is great!  I would say the only potential downside it the instructions recommend oiling it very frequently and I nearly threw the tiny white oil bottle that it comes with.  The oil bottle is inserted in the cardboard packaging and I didn't see it when I took the lopper out of the packaging.  If you want to make cutting stuff up fast and, yes, even fun buy this thing!  I am so pleased!!
I've had this a couple of years now and it works great for my needs.  I used it again this weekend to clean up from a big snowstorm we had a couple of weeks ago.  It chewed up branches up to 5" thick easily. Ironically, it's the little twig pieces that occasionally will cause the chain to dismount.  This has only happened to me twice and was easily fixed with a 1/2" socket wrench and a little common sense.  I have a full size B&D chainsaw I no longer use because this is so much easier and frankly less intimidating.  If you're a logger or frequently cutting firewood maybe you more, otherwise it's really handy to have around.  I can't recall the last time I added a=oil by the way, of course that's probably not something you want to emulate.
Men love gadgets, and merchants continue to come up with fancy but useless gadgets to sell them. This, however, is an exception that is a truly useful innovation.Technically, the Alligator Lopper is a mini-chain-saw with metal guards on both sides, one of which doubles as a clamping jaw. Functionally, it acts as a super-sized and super-powered lopper. It can easily cut through branches up to 5-6" in diameter in one pass.A recent storm brought down a sizable dead branch from one of the oak trees in my yard. This Alligator Lopper took care of it easily. I actually spent more time with the extension power cable than the actual cutting. Without it, I would have had to get a chain saw, which would be a lot more difficult and dangerous.
I have a relative who owns this tool and it is great, so I picked one up. It cuts through everything it is advertised for and makes yard pruning a lot easier and manageable than if it was done manual with shears or by hand. Some of the negative reviews are correct in saying that the chain does fall off occasionally, but not enough to the point where I will bash the items design (once very 100 uses or so, didn't really keep count). Some of the wood chips do get stuck in the crevices of the mouth, but hey every tool needs its maintenance. As far as the bad reviews about the oil being a mess and nuisance, a little goes a long way.For me the PROS definitely weigh out the CONS in this product. If you are on the fence about getting this or a small chainsaw I would say go with the chainsaw because you will not like this product. Me, I have both so I use which ever the job at hand requires.
I have a hydroponics setup, and I needed something to control my PH level for my tomatoes and peppers. I decided to try this since GH seems to be the best in stuff.It worked well, took 4oz of PH down to get it from 8 to 6 in 55 gallons (I have hard well water). Just do not get it on your hand, I got a drop on my hand and it burned, there is now a red mark and it bled a little. Next time I will wear gloves.It may take a few times for your PH level to stable out when you change water, add stuff, etc, so check it every few hours until it's stable.
My only complaint is that it is sometimes hard to get the top off and to stay open while trying to refill the feeder. We also had some animal bend and break off one of our suet holders. Since they are only attached at the top it was easy for the animal (we suspect a racoon) to bend the suet holder up and run off with the suet cake. Eventually the holder snapped off. Minimal complaint though, overall we really like the look of this feeder, it holds a lot of seed, allows multiple birds to feed at one time and doesnt leave that much of a mess on the ground. Pretty sturdy construction, has held up after many severe storms here in Michigan.
This is a pretty basic cedar bird feeder. So far it's lasted 6 months and hasn't broke, although I haven't had any issues with larger animals trying to get at it. Holds a fair amount of feed (enough to last weeks), and it looks better then a lot of the cheaper or overly unnatural looking feeders that are common. My only real complaint is the short/cheap rope it came with. Replaced that with a longer/more durable nylon rope I had and it's held up great!
This feeder works well for the birds as you can attract all typed by putting the sweet cakes and the seed into it.  The downside is squirrels will have access to this unless you hang it on a pole and put a round shield underneath to keep them out but if you do this, you should have no issues with squirrels getting in.  The wood fades it color a little as well in the weather, so I would suggest putting some wood protecting stain/sealer to keep it looking nice all year round.
The birds and I love this feeder. Fairly easy to fill if you use a cup or a scoop. You will need an extra hand if you just want to pour directly from the bag.My dog's behavioural improvement from singing birds is absolutely amazing and the feeling of a nature preserve for me.This is my first bird feeder, so, for people who are wondering....the bird waste hasn't been that big of issue. There seems to be more urine where they eat, but not waste all over the roof or anything like that. Seed scattering happens, but they usually pick that up eventually. The sunflower shells are leftover, but will generally fall down within the grass or if you have it over concrete, you can sweep it up and hose down any bird waste.
This product is a great supplement to the physical weeding you have to do with a weedeater or other device.  What you have to do is to spray the plant on Monday to let the toxin be carried to the root center.  Then, on Wednesday, if you insist on whacking the weed and not just spraying, you can go and tear it down.  It's crucial that the intact plant have 1 or 2 days to take in this product.  If you cut if down and then spray it, you may well be spraying to no effect.  It must be absorbed by a functioning leaf to really take effect.  It does work, but you must take care.  It's impossible to have a spray just for weeds; plants are plants, so if you misfire onto your prized shrub, you'd better spray water promptly to ensure its viability.
I've been using Roundup Ready-to-use Spray for several years to kill weeds growing in sidewalk and driveway cracks and in areas where I have spread mulch (such as around trees and along our fence). Roundup is effective on most weeds and grass and completely kills vegetation within a few days. (It usually takes a week or so maximum to have its effect.) It is important to make sure that you hold the sprayer close to what you intend to kill, for Roundup will kill everything it touches. I'd suggest getting to within a foot or so of what you want to kill, particularly if there is vegetation nearby that you don't want to hurt. While this pre-mixed spray is perfect for spot killing of vegetation, for wider areas use Roundup concentrate with a sprayer that mixes it with the right amount of water.
For the past several years I've been using Roundup on the weeds and grass growing in the gravel driveway because there are just too many of them to pull. Recently a garden center manager on a local news segment pointed out that Round Up is one of the safest herbicides to use because it doesn't linger perpetually in the soil.I've since learned that Round Up is the chemical "glyphosate" and is widely used because it breaks down in the environment and is one of the least toxic applications to animals.For me Round Up is not the speediest of herbicides, but it does eventually kill unwanted growth. It's even successfully killed some thick and persistent poison ivy patches on Spud Acres.
Well, I liked this trap when I opened it. I loved the idea of catching the chipmunk in my basement and then sending him onto freedom far away. I felt a little like Davy Crotchet or something. Unfortunately, I have not been able to trap anything with this trap.It may not be the trap's fault. The chipmunk may have only been visiting or perhaps he made it up to the attic and is busily chewing electrical wires, or whatever they do for fun. I still like the trap, but I would have liked it more if I'd been able to catch something with it.I do know that the deer mice (that I didn't know I also had) were not heavy enough to trip this trap and were eating the bait for a few days before I started trapping them using mouse cubes. The trigger of this trap and setting it just right seems like ti could be tricky.
Chipmunks are cute, but not when they're digging up your plants and undermining your sidewalks.  We bought the Havahart trap a few weeks ago and after experimenting with the bait, we've been catching around one a day. Pecan butter works best.  Just put some pecans in your food processor, and add a little olive or vegetable oil.  They seem to like it more than peanut butter.  Be sure to drop your chipmunks off far, far away (like 4 or 5 miles) or they'll be back!
I have used other box traps for smaller animals and I feel this is the most sensitive, plate trigger I have used.  I will be trapping night rats in the back yark.  Smaller mice, that I have seen from my bedroom window, also feed on the droppings from the bird feeders.  Squirrels may find their way in to my traps and be located to another area of the farm.  I tolerate squirrels and will see that they live somewhere else. This will need to be seasoned a day or two out in the yard to allow the oils and smells to wear off, then, with some success in trapping, I'll report back the results.
I was surprised as I set this trap to catch a rat and it caught a fairly small mouse. Much to my surprise it wasn't able to get out. I have caught from squirrels down to mice with this trap. I really like it versus the stand snap/kill traps becuase they are dual size. You need a big trap for a rat and that rat trap isn't heavy enough to trigger when a mouse steals the bait. If the rat hits the mouse trap they usually don't even slow down. With this live trap you catch whatever enters to steal the bait.I dispatch the caught animal buy placing the trap under water. After 30-45 seconds the critter is dead and the trap is ready to be reset. While many people might use this trap to prevent killing a pest, I use it simply because it catches multiple size rodents.
I got this to catch squirrels that were getting into my attic.  Took it out of the box, baited it with peanut butter placed in a bottle cap (to keep the trap clean) and caught a huge rat that night.  The result was no more noise in the attic.  I shot the squirrel later.I know that some people will object to shooting varmints.  Well, to each his own.  But one thing I like about this trap is that you can shoot whatever you capture with a .22 and you don't have to worry about damaging the trap.  A little rinse from the garden hose and all the evidence is gone. The galvanized metal construction means you don't have to worry about rust.  Get a bigger one for cats.  Shoot, shovel, and shut up.
I wish the larger traps had this design. I have two of these and over the five years or so I've been retired I might have trapped and relocated 150, maybe more chipmunks, and quite a few red and gray squirrels. I use sunflower seeds right ON the trip plate. Rarely has it failed, and then its probably racoons, who don't fit in trap but they roll it over and get the seeds. No candy, don't need peanut butter or the mess. Just the seeds! Make sure to relocate the little chewers at least two miles away. Gray squirrels have a 50% return rate at ten miles relocation (per Cornell Univ), and reds a little less, but you need to get the reds covered fast, they'll kill themselves pretty quick trying to escape.I even trapped a small skunk last summer (not recommended) but it ended well for both me and the silly stinker.Highly recommended!
I have an epidemic of chipmunks in my yard, causing no end of problems.  I had a "Havahart 1025 Two-Door Cage Trap" which works great, but wanted a couple more traps to cut down the population.  I've used the two side-by-side, and can tell you, that chipmunks prefer the 1025 by at least 5-1.  They like the 1025 so much, I've left it out overnight without bait, and found a chippie inside in the morning.The 0745 is nice, but if you're trapping chippies, get the 1025 instead.
About ten years ago a friend pointed out to me that my Amalanchier Lavis bushes were also known as Serviceberry, and that the berries were both edible and delicious. A few years later the long birds got the message as well, as started eating the berries before they were ripe.I draped this net over the bushes, and even though it didn't completely cover the bushes, it did a very good job of discouraging the typical songbird. They'd try to land, get tangled in the net, and fly away frustrated. After a while, none of the birds even tried. (One robin did get tangled to the point of needing human intervention to cut him loose- so if that troubles you, you want to consider a different approach.)I notice there's a 45 foot version of his net for only twice the price, so if you have a large area to protect, that's the way to go.
I had a problem with some critter digging a fresh hole in my backyard at least every other day.  I tryed many methods, but this is the only one that worked.  I would suggest finding some type of tube (pvc pipe) and drop the bomb directly down "deep" into the hole,  and covering it up quickly.  Then place something flat and heavy on the hole to keep the smoke in.  You will need to dig around the hole and open it up a little to make sure the stick gets in there as deep as possible.  Bomb every morning for at least two-three days to make sure you get um!!  Great product that WORKS and is kind of fun to use.  Fire in the hole!!
We have several acres in walnuts on our property and fight an endless battle with the ground squirrels which are very plentiful in our area. Used aggressively and diligently these gassers work pretty well. There are other ones sold which have less than half as much material in them, and those ones don't work worth a darn.The hard part is making sure the squirrel is home when you do the job. The best way is to gas the hole right after you see a squirrel go in it. Follow the directions.
I purchased these and then decided to run to Home Depot and see if they had them so I could use them sooner until my package arrived from Amazon. Home Depot had another brand called Revenge. I used the 4 from Revenge, each one smoked like they are supposed to. a few days later when the Giant Destroyers came, I needed to use those too and unfortunately, they didn't smoke, they shot a bright angry orange flame as if it was a blow torch. The GD's you have to thread the fuse into the bomb which I thought was dumb. I also found that the GD's smelled with stronger sulfur and couldn't wash off the smell from my hands. I don't know if they work or not as again they were blow torches and not smokers. Won't buy these again. Maybe i got a bad batch? won't take the chance again though.
I bought a smaller one last year... garbage. Caught about 18 birds and half dozen chipmunks, not ONE squirrel. In fact they reached in and grabbed food without tripping it.  This year got the bigger one and in 2 mos I have caught 21 squirrels and relocated. I went from them emptying my bird feeders every couple of days to no problems ... btw the feeders can't be jumped on and I smear the poles with vasoline but they run, HIT them and swing til they get the food out. A great success. Went from up to 9 squirrels in yard at one time to rarely even one.
I have only had this trap for two and a half days, but I feel safe in giving this trap five stars because I have already caught six squirrels and one chipmunk.  I will say that it is hard to set the sensitivity high enough to catch the chipmunks and chipmunks can steal the bait.  Still, this works because I have caught two squirrels when there was no bait at all.  I have yet to leave this for more than two hours and not find a squirrel.Some other reviews have mentioned modifying this to make it sensitive enough.  For squirrels I have not needed to modify mine, but I do try to leave the set switch on as lightly as I can.  At first I tried to put the trigger just barely on, but now I put it on all of the way, and then back it down until it is barely engaged.  That seems to work well for me.
This is a good trap, sensitive pedal when set correctly.  Peanut butter for bait and caught a huge squirrel who had been raiding my bird feeders. This squirrel was very large.  Caught the critter in a matter of 2 days, think part of the success of this trap is the length which allows the entire animal to be well within the trap when the door shuts.  Only complaint from me is that when the trap is set, the trap door extends downward so much that it restricts the opening of the trap somewhat(perhaps an inch), making it smaller than the advertised size of the trap.  Good humane trap.
I have never had a trowel this big. I just received it but being in Texas it has already seen a lot of use. I just planted 40 plants today and this thing is simply the best trowel I have ever used.It gets enough soil to easily plant small flowers and 4 inch plants in one scoop, yet is light-weight. It is like a mini-hand shovel. Then I just keep the displaced soil in the trowel reach for it after inserting the plant and place the soil around the new transplant.Now the handle is pretty big around. It was very comfortable for me. Not sure it would be super comfortable for ladies but because it is very cushy and soft it should be ok even though it is big. I do not work for Fiskars but they have become my go-to garden gear choice this past year. Have yet to be disappointed. Have your eye on that 6-pack of petunias? Or severl 6-packs? Get this bad boy then go to town.
I've had my share of trowels over the years, and my main complaint was that they were basically all too small.  Sometimes you just need a bigger shovel, to either dig wider or deeper, and the 'regular' ones just don't cut it.  Enter Fiskars Big Grip.  I saw this in Target and grabbed it immediately; I knew it was simply something I had to have, being a hard core gardener.  I haven't had a job that this has been too small for yet, always planting and moving plants.  It wouldn't be too handy if needing to move or plant something large, when a full size shovel is necessary, but every gardening tool set needs this trowel.  Well made & sturdy, definitely one of my best gardening supply purchases...
This item will come in handy if you are a home owner with a yard or garden. The standard trowel does work but has its limitations. If used properly and not pushed to handle too much it will not break or crack.Also as far as the California warning on this thing, you would be surprised as to how many items have this warning on them that you are not aware of. As long as you don't go and chew on this thing you should be fine.Fiskars has a lifetime warranty on their items so I have no concerns if this items defects in any way.I also bought their 3 piece garden set and with this addition to that set you should have no problems with light/small gardening.
This connector hose came in and I installed it on my Craftsman hose reel. It works and fits perfectly and is doing a great job so far. The shiny brass connectors are a big improvement over the original connector hose that had grown old and leaky over the years.It also served as an occasion to service the Craftsman reel which I had been intending to do but had successfully put off for several years. The o-ring should be lubricated to keep it from drying out and starting to leak. In light of the occasion I also put a new hose on the reel and now it looks and works as good as new.The hose was shipped in very adequate boxing and arrived in perfect condition. If you're using a hose reel this connector hose is a good catalyst for updating and maintaining your reel.I'm very pleased with it.
This house may (or may not) leak, but it has a much more serious problem.  My new hose reel requires female fittings on both ends of the leader hose and this 10 foot leader has a male fitting on one end and a female on the other, so it's useless.  My new reel requires a female fitting for attachment to the reel and it of course requires a female fitting at the faucet end (as do all faucets).  Also, the product smells really bad, so I'm returning it to Amazon.
serves its purpose, but is pretty cheap.if i had to do over, i'd spend an extra $10 and get a heavy duty one.  that way, i could at least have another 10 foot hose that i could use in another application.i put a rubber washer in the female end (all hoses need them, with the more 'heavy duty' ones having them built-in), and that fixed any leaking (cost an extra 30 cents or so).not the best hose in the world, but for $10, it's hard to get pissy about it.
I have been hearing some critters in my attic lately and thought I had squirrels. I have the Havahart 1030 (little bigger) and put it in the attic. It caught something, but what it caught was able to get out through the holes so I knew I had something smaller than a squirrel. I purchased this 1025 and put it in the attic. The first night I caught a flying squirrel and it could not escape. Worked very well at holding him for a few hours till I could relocate it. The next night, I caught another flying squirrels. Two nights, two flying squirrels. While I love this trap, I really hope I'm done with it for a while.The mechanisms on the trap can be a little touchy and you have to play with it to get it to stay just right, but is easy to do after a little practice.
I thought I just had a ground squirrel or two eating my plants...I received this trap on Monday. Caught one squirrel Monday night, two squirrels Tuesday, four on Wednesday. Today I am told there was one squirrel in the trap and eight more trying to spring their comrade (trying to dig him out). Apparently my property is paradise on Earth for the Antelope Ground Squirrel.I won't be buying any more of these traps (I don't have the time to move 10,000 ground squirrels), but it is very effective. While it looks awful, I think we'll be putting a layer of chicken wire or hardware netting on the bottom half of our 4-foot wire fence. Then we'll use this trap on a case-by-case basis.By the way, Antelope Ground Squirrels like peanut butter, green and red grapes, corn and Ritz crackers.
I have an epidemic of chipmunks in my yard, causing me no end of problems.  I've had a one of the 1025s for a while, and it works great, but wanted a couple more traps to cut down the population.  So, I bought another 1025 and also a "Havahart 0745 Live Animal Professional Style Trap".  Since it's advertised as a chipmunk trap, whereas the 1025 is advertised as a squirrel trap, I wanted to compare them.  I've used the two side-by-side, and can tell you, that chipmunks prefer the 1025 by at least 5-1.  They like the 1025 so much, I've occasionally left it out overnight without bait, and found a chippie inside in the morning.I've caught squirrels in this too, they apparently like peanut butter as much as the chippies do.  But usually the chippies get to the bait first.  If you have chipmunks, this is hands-down the best trap I've found.
We decided to use this deer repellent to try to keep the deer away from our ancient pear tree. We installed the system about a month ago and of course, it's a bit hard to tell if it's actually working. I can tell you, though, that there have been no deer tracks within the area that we placed the stakes. A good sign!The only reason I gave this product three stars instead of five is because there is little to no information that comes with the system. A comprehensive set of directions would have been wonderful. Also, you have to really keep an eye on it so that you will know when you have to change the battery. Other than that, it seems to be working just fine.
We live in the Blue Ridge Mountains and have an abundance of deer. My husband planted several fruit trees, and as soon as buds appeared, the deer ate them off. Several trees were so chewed up we were afraid we'd lose them, not to mention other plants that were attempting to grow. We'd tried motion detector lights and scented deterrents such as ivory soap, chimes, etc. and the deer always ignored them after a few days. It took about a week, but we've noticed the buds on our fruit trees and other plants have been untouched. We've also noticed the deer are now crossing much farther down the hill, far away from the plants. I'm sure we'll have to move the devices around, check batteries, etc., but it's worth it to protect our fruit new fruit trees and garden.
We spray our vegetables with deer repellent.  Effective but expensive and washes off.We tried motion detection lights.  Worked for a weekWe tried motion detection sprinklers.  Worked but overwatered the garden.We have a five foot high electric fence around our garden.  The deer jump it.We tried the Havahart 5250 Electronic Deer Repellent.  Worked for a small area but we have a 1/4 acre garden.  We'd need hundreds of dollars worth of these things and the deer could still jump over them.
This electronic deer repellent is interesting, but I'm afraid that there's little way to know if it works.  The idea is to entice deer with a scent so that they touch a set of wires looped at the top of the device, which sends an electrical shock to the deer.  The instructions indicate that it is not intended for an area with a high concentration of deer and that you need to rotate through different scents to keep them from associating the shock with the scent item.  The units came with an acorn scent and I can imagine teaching the deer to avoid acorns while they continue to eat your fruit trees or scrape their horns on our aspen trees.  I'm not sure whether they have reduced the damage that the deer have done in my yard, but my dog avoids acorns with a passion now.  I guess that's good though ... right?  I would say nice try, but maybe a bit off the mark.
This is a set of three posts that gives a gentle shock to animals.  Setup took about 20 minutes and the weekly deer lure is easy to replace.We have roses in the flower beds in Northeast Florida.  Unfortunately, deer love to eat the roses.  After a total of 10 weeks, this product is still staying strong.  Our roses are unfettered by the deer.  Our neighbors down the street don't have as much luck, and they've tried everything.  Now, they want to buy this product, also.If you have a problem with wildlife, give this product a try.  It works with the deer who, before, raided our flower beds.Highly recommended.
The theory here is that you can prevent deer from coming around by luring them in to these stakes as the most attractive place to go, and then when they come in closer it zaps them.Unfortunately this means that these stakes have to have the scent added to them over and over, and have to be placed in a way that it's more inciting than your trees or flowers.  If setup right, they seem to keep the deer away, but for easy of use I prefer a bar of soap with a hole drilled in it (like ivory spring), or use milorganite on the ground.  Both which also use the deer's heightened sense of smell, but to keep them away instead of luring them in and zapping them.
I put the deer repellent in my backyard, and it seems like it might be working. I put it close to my berry bushes since deer really like to eat those and they eat up all the new grows every year, and I was really tired of it. I still see some deer in the area from time to time, but my bushes look fine. I try not to forget to add the oil to the stakes every now and then, especially after rain. Once I didn't, and I was able to make a nice picture of baby deer standing next to the repellent. So, yes, it will only work if you keep it charged because there is always new deer that haven't been at your yard before and does not know it is not welcomed.There was a lot of information on the package on how and where to install the stakes so they will work the best. It was a bit tricky to assemble the parts, I had to ask my husband for help.
We live in suburbia - 1/2 acre to 1 acre plots - in Westchester County New York.  Lots of deer.  These have an odd way of working.  They actually use a scent to ATTRACT deer, then they use a shock to repel them.  It's a bit odd.  Unless the deer actually touch the wires, they are never repelled - only attracted.I haven't done a statistical study, but I would say that the deer are MORE active on our property than they used to be.  Previously, they would wander through.  Now, they are curious and stick around because of the scent.  I have only seen one deer (a huge buck) touch the wires.  It only seemed mildly phased - and didn't run away or anything.These are also very dangerous if you have kids around.  There are package warnings, but the wires give off a pretty good shock to humans - probably not enough to do any damage, but pretty unpleasant.
Herds of deer patrol our yard and shrubs and they've done serious damage.  We've fenced our vegetable garden and put netting over other shrubs that we don't want the deer to eat, but such solutions are not always convenient.  This is a clever solution that doesn't take a lot of space or skill to implement but isn't cheap either.  So far the deer have kept their noses and mouths off of our unfenced tomato plants protected by one of these.  Some otherwise vulnerable flowers appear to be receiving protection from the others.  Testing to make sure that they're working involves a mild shock.  Oh deer.
I agree with the one-star review titled "Pointless" written by "Kitten Kisser".  I live in an area that falls between the last two categories "Rural residential" and "Rural non-residential agricultural" - I have high deer density, damage is frequent but unpredictable.  Since I installed them, I haven't seen any deer in my yard, but my schedule has been erratic, so it's not unusual.  I've seen deer damage on plants near one of the three repellent stakes, but not near the other two.  But then, I don't know if I would have seen damage on those plants if the stakes were not there.I will continue to re-scent the stakes, at least as long as the supply lasts.  And I'll move the stakes, as the instructions say.  But since my walnut tree got partly eaten, I don't have high hopes for these stakes doing the job.
I was hoping to use this in the non-fenced part of our yard, since that is where the deer shred our flowers.Be warned, if a bird alights on this, they will get a shock. If a fox or dog sniffs it, they too will get a shock.Not to mention children, and since we don't have a fence in the front, children do cut through out yard.So, maybe if you live out in the country this would be useful.  But if you live in the city and you don't have a fence and there are children around...
I have been using this product for awhile to see if it made a big difference. It works in a small area, I tried it on a large area and the Deer still came. I tried it around my backyard about 50 feet and it actually worked better. I think the deer get smart after awhile and go around it. The babies run one to three but the parents will try try again. Overall for a small area this will work great for you. A large area you need to adjust all to see how much you can get covered
The concept sounds good, but one has to wait and see how this works in each individual case. You coat cotton balls with a deer attractant - and when a deer sticks its nose towards the balls they will get zapped by an electrical charge from two AA batteries. The negative side of this is that acorn scent has to be applied often; if it rains then the scent is washed out. I put this in my back yard about a week ago, but I have not seen any deer passing nearby, I will wait longer to see its effect.1.Bird-X DG Deer Gard Ultrasonic Deer Repeller2.Havahart Deer Off DO32RTU Deer Rabbit and Squirrel Repellent 32 Ounce Ready-to-Use Spray
I got these to use around my garden, as I live in the country and we have frequent deer guests who love to munch on our corn seedlings, flowers and other garden plants. I placed the spikes as directed and put the lure liquid in as directed- the set up was easy. Just about anyone could set this up. After around 3 weeks, my plants are untouched by the deer. I saw one deer come up and then suddenly jump and take off, so I'm sure that it was the shock from the Havahart that sent him packing. Hopefully, it will keep working.One big warning with this (as stated on the packaging) is that if a small child happens upon these spikes they will get a shock as well. My niece, when we weren't watching got a bit too close and got a shock that upset her. So, if you have small children that like to wander or play out in your garden, I might advise against putting this anywhere they could wander into it.
Although I have been unable to see the deer getting shocked by this device it does appear to be working. I have a severe deer problem with them nibbling on just about everything I plant. I placed these by the plants that they seemed to like the most and it appears to be keeping them away from those plants. I only wish there was some king of a "counter" on these stakes to register how many "hits" there might have been. Without any way of knowing for sure I am only speculating on whether they are working or possibly the deer just moved on of their own accord. The stakes were easy to assemble and although the instructions were very brief I think they were sufficient for such a simple device. Only a review by a deer could be more objective.
Directions say limited success in rural areas with bigger deer populations..I agree.  Actually had deer walk right by the stakes when they had only been out 1 day and the "acorn scented" lure did nothing in attracting them.  Trying to insert cotton balls into the very small holes on the stakes were nearly impossible. What does work well is the little shock that you do get if you touch the top of stake.  Of course, then you would have to wait awile for it to repower to shock again.  On that point alone it would work on the deer. What we are going to try next is just putting all the stakes in a line to try to keep the deer from entering the area we're trying to protect.  If you have any experience at all w/deer, you know there's practically nothing they won't try to eat so you need to always think ahead when you want to plant all those pretty flowers and bushes!
This is a decent, cheap nozzle. It doesn't leak and does not break easily. I bought the yellow so I could spot it in my yard easily. I did break the first one I had, but that was my fault. I was reeling it back in and the handle caught on a rock out of my line of sight. I kept reeling it in anyway, and yanking on the hose until the handle broke. I would say that under normal conditions, and even somewhat rough conditions this nozzle holds up well.
This nozzle seemed to be well made and it worked great for a few weeks.After about 2 months of occasional use (maybe used it 4-5 times during that time), the whole nozzle started to leak water everywhere. Another reviewer mentioned that the internal components of this nozzle are made from cheap plastic and will break easily from regular use, and it seems they were right. No pressure at all on the trigger and there is water going everywhere. I just turn on the hose and immediately this nozzle starts leaking water.Don't waste your money, get something better.
When I turn the water on, the nozzle starts spraying water, without me touching it or pushing the handle. Today I wanted to wash my yard, I left the hose with the nozzle on the floor until I turned the water on. By the time I got to the hose, the water coming out from the nozzle soaked my coffee table in the living room through the screen door that was closed. The water on the nozzle is always on until I turn off the water supply. This is totally unacceptable.
I have had a Mantis tiller since1990 and it was time to get a new one.  The old one did not have a way to pump the fuel into the carborator and this one does.  The main problem with this tiller is keeping the dirt out of the carborator.  Every time you use this tiller I would remove the air filter and clean it and around the carborator.  I use it in rocky soil and rocks do bind up the blades but you can easily remove the rocks.  It will dig right through weeds and will dig deep to make a garden.
Spinosad is really quite revolutionary (I suggest doing a wikipedia search, so you know EXACTLY what you are getting).It is completely harmless to pets, children, and plants. Unlike many pesticides you can spray this heavily on leaves and roots with zero negative effects. It works wonders on most insects.One note of caution: after being mixed with water it is only effective for 24 hours, so only mix as much as you will need per application. Anything left over will be waste. This bottle is a concentrate that will last you a very, very, very long time.Even kept in a dark, cool environment the concentrate in this bottle will only last 2 years, so you may want to get a slightly smaller quantity, but it was a perfect amount for me as I have a food forest and permaculture garden,
Spinosad (pronounced spin-OH-sid) is a somewhat new organic spray out on the market, brewed from, of all things, a soil bacteria found underneath an abandoned rum distillery in the Caribbean.Spinosad is extremely effective, yet it's only mildly toxic to humans and birds. I use it to get rid of thrips primarily, but it kills leafminers and spider mites too. It also kills caterpillars for about a month after spraying, so if you're trying to attract butterflies to your garden, don't use this around any plants that caterpillars like to eat.Spray early in the morning before bees come out, as spinosad spray is toxic to honeybees while wet.
This product just plain WORKS -- I have fought leaf miners for several years in my tomatoes, basil and some of the flowers, this year I tried this product.  My problem is down at least 90% only the petunias are not responding as well as other plants, but still problem is down at about 75%.  It also has rid me of spider mites and aphids, so i don't have to spray for them on the roses.  I even have had great luck using it on roses when mixed with Bonide FungOnil, putting recommended amount of BOTH in my sprayer and completing two tasks at same time.  I highly recommend Monterey's Sipnosad.
I finally managed to get rid of the ants that were living in my garden for the past 3 yrs.  Ants kept taking residence in my garden and since I stick with organic practices, I didn't have many options.  Tried growing things that the ants didn't like and boiling water.  They just kept coming back.  This insect spray is OMRI listed, so I filled a sprayer and sprayed the ant hills and drenched the soil in that portion of the garden.  Its been several weeks now and no more ants.Just be careful how you apply this stuff.  It can be harmful to beneficial insects as well (ladybugs, bees, etc.).
This thing is amazing! Made of steel, very durable and incredibly versatile. It opens as wide as 22 inches for when raking leaves on your lawn, drive-way, etc. and the best, which was freaking great, it closes to 7 inches, which helped a GREAT deal when raking leaves from the street curb.This rake is light, manageable and very easy to use. I didn't experience is strain or felt tired while using it. A great tool that I promise you won't regret buying. I loved it so much, I gave one to a co-worker and my in-laws. Trust me, you won't need another rake again.
Love the adjust-ability but it was kind of stuck when I first tried it and I actually had to old the rake in my hand and use my feet to give it a push to unstick it - after that it adjusted just fine and on the fly which is very very handy. I'd never hear of an adjustable rake but when checking Amazon this came up high in the search and I chose it after a quick comparison of a few models and am glad I did, this is so much better than a regular rake, it is several rakes on one. I just wonder if the plastic lever lock will last so one star reduced for the plastic.
This spray, mixed as directed, will keep squirrels away for at least 30 days even with rain (but the area dry when sprayed).  There are no deer or rabbits in my area but with neighbors feeding squirrels they are over-populating this small neighborhood.  Squirrels dig up plantings all around my home and "plant" their peanuts in my garden pots.  They also run along the top of the fence, teasing my dog, jump onto the roof where they shell the peanuts leaving the hulls in the gutters.  By spraying the top of my wood fences the squirrels stay off of them, and don't get to the roof.  I even spray the fence in the winter when it is fairly dry and it seems to continue working.  I want to try spraying it on landscaped areas where I would prefer my dog stay out.  If that works, I'll be back in a month with an update.  This is a product I will definitely continue using!!
I was a little skeptical about this product. I've used so many products to try and keep the rapacious squirrels away from my urban container garden, but nothing seems to work, at least long term. I've tried water spray motion detectors and fox urine, etc. but the squirrels continue to dig up or eat everything -- strawberries, tomatoes, flower bulbs.I followed the directions, diluting this liquid into a spray bottle with water and dowsing the plants that get attacked. The sprayer did get clogged so that eventually I was sort of plopping dribbles on the plants, and there is some discoloration on the leaves, but despite heavy rains the past couple of weeks, there still hasn't been a squirrel sighting, and I used to see them every time I looked out on the deck -- they were out there more than I was!So I have to say that so far it's going well, and I'll update this review if necessary.Oh, and there are definitely no deer showing up on our third floor balcony either ;-)
I have now tried several of Havahart's deer, rabbit and squirrel repellant.  Others I have tried have worked but this product is a mixed bag.  Diluting this and using the proper sprayer alone is a challenge as the nozzle does clog from the small granules.  And one has to make sure this is only used on none-edible shrubs.We live in the high desert and don't have deer come into our subdivision, but we do have rabbits in the predawn hours nibbling in gardens.  This stuff does work at repelling the rabbits, but the potency isn't very long-lasting.For the price and the work needed to apply this repellant effectively, I'm better off using dog feces around my shrubs to keep the rabbits away.
This repellent is  easy to use. It is concentrated and you just mix with water and spray onto the plants you want to protect. (The 32 ounce bottle will make 2 gallons of repellent.)I have used other animal repellents in the past that just smell awful. This one did not smell too bad. (at least not as bad as the other ones I tried).I applied it to some of my susceptible plants and so far it seems to be protecting them.I like that the formulation is safe to use around pets and children. I try to avoid anything toxic in my garden and this product is approved for organic gardening.
This "Deer Off" deer, rabbit, and squirrel repellent works well to keep squirrels away from my shed. We don't keep much of a garden and don't mind the deer that come into our yard, but have a fairly serious issue with squirrels getting into my shed and eating our plastic gas cans (seriously annoying).This is a natural and non-toxic (to the animals) way to deter the critters without hurting them. We apply this around the outside and on the roof after each rain and it has kept our squirrel damage way down.Recommended!CFH
We are rural with quarter acres vegetable plots so deer are a big problem.  We have five feet of electical fencingParmak Super Energizer 5 Low Impedance 110/120 Volt 50 Mile Range Electric Fence Controller SE5running around our garden but our neighbor's garden doesn't have a fence and his beans were getting hit hard by the deer.Because you can't spray it on food, my brother dumped the entire container of Deer Off in a bucket (said it looks and smells like chicken wing sauce made with butter and hot sauce) added a little water, and soaked rope in it.  He then strung the rope around the garden. Voila - no more deer.He just ran the rope this week and it rains daily so I don't know how long it will last.  I'll add an addendum.Dinged the product a star because of the price but will give it back if it really does last 90 days.
Followed the simple instructions for application and applied this to my fruit bearing bushes, herb garden, vegetable garden, and flower beds. My problem is rabbits and an occassional deer. So far, i have not spotted any offenders in the treated areas.Since I only applied this a few days ago, i cannot attest to its effectiveness over a three month period. However, I am pleased with its performance and ease of application. It is doing a good job when it comes to keeping my growing rabbit population at bay.
I've used Deer Off before and didn't have very good results with the sprayer so I decided to try the concentrate formula.It states to NOT use on plants that are intended for human consumption so all of our garden plants that are getting eaten by the squirrels and deer have no hope at. We used it on other plants and the plants that we applied it to had burned brown areas on them in a few days.We also applied it around the bird feeder to keep the squirrels away and to some trees to keep the deer from rubbing up on them, all with no results. The best thing that we have found is to try and plant Deer-resistant plants when possible. For the garden, I have no clue how to keep those pesky squirrels out.
Deer Off makes a great product.  While using Deer Off, my garden has not been terrorized by rabbits.  This is an economical solution and all it requires is a spray pump and some water. A 32 oz bottle will yield you 2 gallons and enough to treat 4000 sq feet according to the manufacture.It dries odorless and is safe to use around pets and children.  My dog is never bothered by it, and still pees on the bushes.  But at least the flowers haven't been eaten by rabbits.It's a great product, I recommend it.
I have 12 bird feeders hanging from poles in my front and back yard. A lot of the bird food falls to the ground. This works well in feeding large birds that are too big to perch on the feeders. It also attracts many squirrels. I have separate feeders for squirrels but they are not satisfied with just their feeders and gobble up the bird seed as well which leaves very little for the big birds. I sprayed Deer Off around the bottom areas of the bird feeder poles in the hopes that squirrels would be repelled. After the Deer Off had dried the squirrels returned in full force to their old stomping grounds. I swear I could hear them giggling at me.This product should be labeled "Rip Off" based on its cost and lack of performance.
Havahart DF32CP-4 Deer Off Repellent Concentrate is an all-natural organic formula that repels by taste and odor deer, rabbits, squirrels and possibly other nuisance animals unless they are starving or otherwise out of normal control, e.g. rabid.  This is not an industrial repellent working against anything that walks, but rather for the suburban home and garden use.  Its garlic, putrescent egg, and capsaicin are not offensive to all people and thus applicable not only in gardens, lawns, and landscaped areas, but also some basements, cellars, and storage.  However, it is ineffective against very determined animals.
When you open up the cap you can smell the hot pepper from several feet away.  It's about the same consistency as salad dressing.  Be sure to dilute it enough if you're using a sprayer.  I only diluted it 50% because I wanted it to be super strong and it was still too thick, it kept clogging the nozzle.  Note that if you have a problem with cats using the vegetable garden as a kitty litter box, this product doesn't seem to work on cats; just other critters like rabbits and squirrels.
Deer off will keep , Deer, Rabbits and Squirrels away.I used it last year after the Deer chewed up some of my plants, and it did work. Although it put a white film on my green leafs..The Deer stayed away. The other bottle came with a sprayer, this one does not!Since I grow Organic, it does say , do not spray on eatable plants. which i would not do. I cover my veggies with chicken wire.Make sure when using this, it is not Windy outside.It is a bit stinky, which the Deer do not like. It is made from sometype of Egg Solids.Mix concentrate thoroughly prior to mixing.Mix with tap water at a ratio of 1 part to 7  parts of water.Use 4 oz, of concentrate and 28oz of water to make 1 qt.32 oz of spray mixture.Contents of  1 quart bottle makes 2 gallons of spray when mixed with 7 quarts of water..Hope this helps..
We have loved the Deer Off products. This is very easy to use and very effective. Hay has gotten crazy expensive and we needed to keep deer out of the feed. We used this around the concrete pad before our hay was stacked. We have had no problem with deer getting into it. This comes in much larger sizes and we will be using those to keep our hay safe. It works effectively in high winds  which I had concerns about.  We also used it to keep rabbits out of my herbs. I don't really care that they eat eh herbs, I care that the barn cat kills the babies horribly in front of my kids.This has helped us avoid bunny murders and save money- great product.
My problem is rabbits, cats and squirrels.This product is more difficult to use than Havahart Critter Ridder 3146 Animal Repellent Granular Shaker. You have to dilute the concentrate, then spray it from your own sprayer. I was tempted to just pour the concentrate around, but didn't. This product sprays on the foliage, while the granules stay on the ground. This may be a better product for deers since they are not close to the ground, but deers are not my problem.The product smells horrible, but that's how it works. Don't spray it in the wind. Really. I mean it.You can still smell a faint odor when it dries.It seems to wash off after one rain.It seemed to have no effect no rabbits, squirrels and cats. For these critters, the granules seem to work better.Finally, the measuring cup that comes with the concentrate and sits on top of the cap shattered in transit. This was annoying.
You need a sprayer to use this.  I recommend theSmith 190285 1-Gallon Bleach & Chemical Sprayer With Non-Corrosive 14-Inch Wand and Single Nozzle System.  This is used in a 1:7 ratio with water and comes with a measuring cup on top.  We have tons of deer on our property and this seems to be keeping them away.  It even seems to work after a decent rain storm.  I painted a 4 foot wide boarder between my manicured property and the woods where the deer inhabit.  It has worked to keep the deer on their side of my invisible fence.  I mixed it up a bit strong 2:7, not 1:7.
The drought and drought restrictions has caused most vegetation to dry out and more varmints to munch on almost anything green or juicy. They're desperate and trying to catch a break which I understand. I just don't want to chance the illnesses they spread with their droppings or traveling guests (fleas, ticks etc).I tried this formulation to keep the varmints away. The product's offensive rotten egg smell does that BUT it dissipates after 3-4 days and the munchers return to make up for lost time. I guess our Texas varmints are used to hot sauce and chili pepper because it does NOTHING to keep the varmints away.In essence, it keeps varmints and neighbors away for a few days but that's it. This may work better where the animals are not in such desperate conditions. It didn't keep the Texas varmints at bay long enough to cost justify this product.
it fixed my squirrel problems real fast. i have a huge container garden that i use to grow some plants that i love to grow. the squirrels were attracted to my nursery pots and they did a lot of damage to my plants and tore up a lot of my plants and the soil. i used deer off repellent and they didn't enter my yard period after that. i sat there in my lawn chair and watched those squirrels outside of my property line and just stood there looking. i will have to routinely spray this product around the perimeter of my garden to keep the squirrels out.
I do not have a problem with Deers. I do have a probllem with rabbits and mole and lizzards and frogs . I am glad to say that The Deer Off has seemed to make an impact on the for now. I have notice a decline in these critters around my property.  I live next to a wooded lot and would like to keep the animals and critters in the woods. Before I could not even put my garbage out and now I can.This has worked so far I havenot seen any frogs trying to jump in my pool or creepy crawlies running about as well.
Squirrels dig up all the plants in my small backyard in the fall and sit on my fence and throw black walnut shells against the white paint on my garage, staining it deeply.  I ignored this product for a long time assuming it was toxic and because I did not want to get rid of the squirrels completely.  Once I realized it really was a safe mix that wouldn't kill everything, I thought it would be nice to try.  And it is.  I can put a very small amount on boxed plants and on my fence without scaring the squirrels out of the yard completely.  Comes with an easy to use mixing dish that stores easily.
I got this product for one thing only, to keep the squirrels off of my bird feeder.  Not the actual feeder, but the long pole from which the feeders hang.  If I was sure it wouldn't deter the birds, I would put it on the feeder itself.  The problem is, it has been raining in Georgia almost every single day for the last two weeks, so I don't know how effective it is.  I haven't seen the squirrels climb up as normal, but I'm not sure if it's just because I throw a slipper at the window and they've associated the feeder with a loud noise, or if it's because of this product.  I promise to come back and update when we have consecutive rainy days!
We have over 30 young fast growing tress that are attracting deer every evening. I decided to put this on the fencing that is around the tress as a test and every single one that I used the deer off on has no bitten leaves. The deer knew which ones did not have the product on. I have since sprayed this on all of the trees and and am very thankful I finally found a product that works.The best thing about the application process is that you do not have to wait for a specific season, which most of competitors ask. I used this late july/ early august with optimal results. There was no plant or grass damage afterward. I did however wait a few days after the rain to apply just to be sure and the product seemed to work instantly.
Seriously - this stuff smells good enough to put on my scrambled eggs. I don't use a sprayer. so I diluted this in water and splashed on and around the area I want to protect. My main varmints are bunnies and squirrels - eating my flowers, chewing through my landscaping power cables and drip water system supply lines. The squirrels even damage the chainlink fence - they chew through the wires holding the fence to the supports. So I diluted this stuff in water and splashed the fence, wires, and drip system. No more chewing damage!
I have three large oak trees on my property and lots of squirrels.  I hate it when the get into my garbage cans. They will even chew through plastic covers to get inside. The also jump from some of my smaller trees onto my roof.I used this around my garbage cans and small trees. It works. I still see squirrels in my yard but they are staying away from my garbage cans and the smaller trees near my house.I like the fact that this is safe for animals and humans. It seems to last despite some rain storms. It does not any noticeable odor.This keeps the squirrels away. It is not toxic and lasts despite rain storms. It is a great product.
To be honest, it's hard to tell how well this product is working. I haven't had any deer damage since applying it, but I haven't seen the 2 deer around that were always in my yard either, since then. (I live in a very rural forested mountainous area. They might have headed up to the high country for the hot summer.) So I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt, will update later. I have used a similar product, Liquid Fence, that worked pretty well. Both products smell really bad at first, but the odor doesn't last, for us humans, at least. And Deer Off claims to last longer, also includes capsaicin (hot pepper). It has a convenient measuring cap attached.
Last summer I found that the Deer Off II with battery controlled sprayer saved my new rose bush so I was eager to to try this concentrated version. It works just as well but takes more effort to use.  First you have to mix it and the full directions are for a much larger amount than I need at any given time.  The bottle also gives ratios for mixing so you need to figure that out to how much you need and mix it accordingly.I re-used the bottle and battery controlled sprayer and the product worked just as well as it did last summer.  As with the previous Deer Off product you'll need to respray after moderate rainfall I've found and the product can discolor the leaves and flower petals a bit if you put too much on.  That's a challenge because you'll have to experiment to get a feel for how much is too much too keep the critters at bay.
Deer-Off is one of those products that does what it's supposed to do with a minimum of muss and fuss. I tried other products to keep my plants (especially hostas) from the clutches of freeloading deer and other varmints, but with varying degrees of success. Deer-Off worked the first time I tried it, and it has worked every time since. If I apply it, I know I don't have to worry about my prized plants becoming tonight's critter salad bar. However, this product isn't cheap, and if you follow the label directions, you'll need to re-apply every 90 days (more if you get a lot of rain). True, 32oz. of Deer Off seems like a huge amount of repellent, but it takes two bottles a year to treat our rather large lot as directed. Granted, I'm happy to pay a fair price for a product that works well--I just wish the price of this particular product wasn't quite so high.
After getting this I realized it is the same stuff I've used before but that was in a battery-operated-spray  bottle which I never could get to work properly.I strained the concentrate through an old  nylon "knee-hi" to remove any possible lumps before putting it in a sprayer.  I HATE trying to un-plug a sprayer! It's sort of stinky  but the scent  doesn't last long. I was hoping if I sprayed the deck railings and trees this would keep the squirrels, and whatever comes at night and drains the hummingbird feeders  and leaves them on the railing for a refill, would be deterred.  I think it might have lasted two days then they were right back...sigh. I think they just adapt after a few days.This is supposed to last for about three months. Maybe in a dry climate but we have had rain almost every day this summer. This might work for most people but I think I just have stubborn, determined little critters.
We have deer and rabbits.  This works reasonably well as far as we can tell, but you need to apply every few days and after any rain.  We use a garden sprayer to get under the leaves as well.  It would really be good to have an a-b comparison, bt we don't have enough kale and collards to sacrifice to the test - what we do observe is that if you spray, you might get a nibble or two in the next day or so, but if you forget to re-apply after a rain, WHAM - complete defoliation within 48 hours.
I purchased two of these traps for my folks home.  They are having a cat problem.  Cat are leaving dropping around and harrasing the family bird in the back yard.  People Spay or Neuter your car-Bob Barker.  I set up the traps in the back yard.  I bought cheap cat food tins, or tuna cans if I ran the first one.  Just study where the cats enter your property and leave the trap activated with food.  I like using an old bed sheet cut to the shape of the trap.  So as not give off the shiny factor of the trap.  Animals are more suspicious of shiny new objects than covered up ones.  Plus having something over your cage calms the cat down and wont be meowing as much during the night once they are trapped.  As I put these traps up, snap in 10 minutes.  Animal Control in my area only takes feral cats and not cats that are domesticated.  But less cats in my area.
This Fiskars rake is basically the same exact thing as any other rake I've ever used.  I have two complaints- one, it clogs leaves very easily, which of course means constantly stopping to pull the leaves away, and two, it's not as sturdy as it might appear.  Mine hasn't exactly broke yet, but I get the feeling it will in a couple months.  Those are my only complaints.  The long handle is nice, too.  Helps out my achy breaky back after all those snowstorms we stinkily had to experience last winter.
Best leaf rake I ever owned. The 5ft lightweight aluminum handle is perfect for us &#34;mature&#34;  individuals who prefer things easy to use. The rake part adds another foot to the length and is two feet wide at the very tip end. The plastic rake part is attached to the aluminum pole with a single screw. That makes it a simple task if the rake part needs replacing. This garden tool makes raking almost a pleasure.Prime members can have this delivered to your door for just under 16 bucks. That is one heck of a deal for such a fine rake. This is a winner.
This is another innovative and quality product by Fiskar.  The rake is very light with a flexible clog free design, perfect for gently scraping your lawns clean without ripping up the grass or raking away your garden mulch.  The design of the rake also allows you to use it at more angles so you don't need to throw the rake ahead of you and pull it diagonally against the lawn like classic curved v-shaped rakes.  The user experience is analogous to a indoor broom rather than a big stiff leaf rake.The handle has an innovative oblong design which fits perfectly into your hand and helps you to maintain rake orientation, particularly in gloved hands.I have found that the orange sleeve has tendency to slide up the handle, but it's too long to come completely off unless you are really determine to remove it.Overall it's the best yard rake you're going to find!
Somehow I am always a little surprised by how short the fiskar products are when I receive them in the mail, but eventually I get used to the length.  The product came well packaged and I liked that it comes with the safety cover, which is important for me since I have little ones who get curious about the tools.  I've used this product the last two days to help me cut deep roots in an area where we had a tree cut down and I am ow converting into a flower bed.  I was able to get most of the roots out except for a few that I will just have to cover over and out a planter in that area.  I ordered the Fiskars tool sharpener which seemed to help a few times after using the axe in the dirt and somewhat moist clay soil.  I would definitely recommend this tool.
This is not an axe for splitting large logs, although it could handle moderately sized logs just fine.  It may sound like paranoia, but we live on an island, and so one reason I bought this is to keep it in the attic.  After hearing about hurricanes that have trapped folks in their homes for lack of a way to get out of an attic, I thought it better safe than sorry to have one one hand should the need ever arise.  I don't do a lot of splitting of wood here.The weight feel good and well balanced, and the flare on the handle makes the likelihood of letting if slip out of my hand unlikely.  I'm pleased with this axe for the value, and have always been impressed with Fiskars products.
Purchase this sprayer to squirt the neighbors little yappy dog that they do not exercise or have taught it not to bark at other much larger dogs and people. The dog will bark the entire time I am out with my Labs in the back yard playing with them after work or on weekend. They will let the dog out and it charges the fence and barks it head off the entire time I am out any where from 10 minutes to an hour. This does the job, I squirt the dog and it runs back inside and stands and barks at us, at least it is muffled and the barking annoys its owners too.
Here are the ADVANTAGES and DISADVANTAGES of this device...ADVANTAGES.1. It produces a fine mist to a stream - the best combination that I have ever experienced..2. It is an excellent replacement for the average pump sprayer..3. The construction material is very durable..4. The balance is very good..5. The device is light..6. The nozzle design is ingenious - it can pivot up and down within 180 degrees...DISADVANTAGES.1. At $18, it is very expensive. You can purchase six regular pump sprayers for the price of one.
This little beauty is just what I have been looking for. It pumps up in seconds, smoothly, too. Just a twist of the lid and it releases the pressure. The handle fits my hand and the pivoting spray head lets me get the water on the plants instead of the wall. More pumps = more pressure and bigger spray. Thick plastic, lock on spray button. The little cone helps contain diameter of the spray. I love this thing. Holds just enough water, but, not so much that it's heavy.
I waited to do this review until the plants in the vertical portion of my square foot garden were in full bloom.The trellis was easy to put up, very light weight and very sturdy.It is holding up loads of heavy cucumbers, lima beans, pole beans and crowder peas (which have very heavy leaves and vines) in multiple garden beds.  The squares are large enough that I can reach my hands through it to harvest plants on the interior of the garden beds easily.This has been a great investment!  Highly recommend.UPDATE:  4/1/13 spring garden season has begun and this will be the third year for my trellis netting.  Think this might be the last year, but note that I have left it ouside on the frame this entire time--too lazy to take down and put up each year.  If you were to store it in off season I'm guessing you could get five years out of this product.
Romaine Parris lettuce is fantastic.  It's so good you can actually eat it right out of the bag!  Yes that's right- you don't always have to make a salad out of lettuce.  There's no rule that says you have to eat lettuce with dressing and combine it with other vegetables.  I've always believed that eating lettuce the way it's presented is the healthiest and most pleasurable way to enjoy it.  Not that I don't like eating salads occasionally.  I don't want to contradict myself here since I just wrote a review for Italian Robusto salad dressing.  It's just that, you know, lettuce by itself is sometimes the perfect way to munch on a healthy food.  Anyway sorry for the little ramble there.  I tend to do that.  Just make sure you get your fill by indulging in some fantastic lettuce.  Romaine lettuce is the way to go for the best in nutrition, enjoyment and a perfect snack.
This isn't a well built Deck Box since it's so cheaply made of plastic. On top of that, I had it shipped to the Volga region, which cost me about $[...]. I probably should have invested in something locally made out of wood or bricks, but I hadn't thought of that. The purpose of it was to store old shoes given to me by the local shoemaker, but he went out of business. Now I only use it to store dead rats that I have found on the countryside property.

I have one outside on my deck and a second one in my garage.  They have each held up very nicely.  If you assemble them correctly (and trust me it's easy to NOT do it correctly) they are very solid.  The problem some are having is they are failing to assemble them correctly and sadly the design allows that to mistakenly happen.  Rubbermaid needs to do something to address this.  When it's put together wrong you'll definitely get people saying they don't hold up.
I'm not sure why some reviewers have had problems with this falling apart, but i haven't had any problems with mine and I move it around the patio all the time and on occasion even use it as a bench.I really can't come up with any reason why anyone would have a problem with this. I use it to store my hose, sprinkler, and yard tools with room to spare. This box is very secure and water tight. It is designed so it can be locked up. All you need is a lock which is not included.It has been exposed to the elements here which include scorching hot sunshine, torrential rain, freezing cold, hail, sleet, and a lot of snow. It is fade resistant and while not exactly fashionable, it is unobtrusive and works with anything and conveniently fits in any corner and can stay outside all year long.
We have a few of these. In different sizes. They go together easily. No idea why the first step is knocking out plastic parts. They couldn't do this?  Otherwise assembly takes about 60 seconds. We have several of this size box and some have tops that fit perfectly. Others have tops that are too deep and the lock hole doesn't line up. It is weather resistant but not water (or insect) proof. Even when perfectly assembled there are small cracks between the pieces that allow small bugs to enter. So not for dog food or anything like that. Stuff inside stays dry. Also, if you use a lock understand that the lock is just aesthetic. A ten year old could pull the sides or back off to gain access.
This is as good a storage box for the price as we've found.  It's sturdy, roomy and looks as if the inside will remain dry (we keep it out on our patio).  Assembly was a breeze as the assembly pictures are printed on the outside of the large shipping carton -- if you know your letters, you're home free.Inserting the lid's hinge pins into the keepers on the back wall of the box is a snap.  As mentioned elsewhere, place the flat part of the tip of a large screwdriver against the pin and smack the tip with a hammer to drive the pin home.  Took all of 15 minutes to assemble, including walking out to the garage to find the screwdriver and hammer.We like it so much, we're thinking of ordering a second box.
This Rubbermaid deck box is lightweight plastic.  It comes with a hole on the lid to attach a padlock.Assembly was easy.  I didn't like having to punch out the tabs with a hammer and flathead screwdriver, but it wasn't tremendously difficult.  The pieces snapped in like they should.  I had to have my husband help me with a few of the screws, because the plastic had indentations for the screws but no holes.I'd have liked this deck box to be a little bigger (my fault for not measuring).  The back and seat cushions for my four chairs did not all fit.  In fact, I could only get the back cushions in.It's a sturdy box.  I'm not sure if it leaks.  If it survives the next rain, I'll try remember to come back to update.______________________UPDATE 11/29/12: This box still looks new after more than a year. It's raining today and I checked. The box is dry inside, no leaks.
To begin, this thing is HUGE.  (The measurements provided don't provide a good &#34;picture&#34; of how big it is).  The assembly is straightforward but strange (It kind of &#34;snaps&#34; together).  I haven't had any problems with the thing falling apart, but it seems like it could at any second.  I move it around on my patio with things inside and it stays together.  If you need some extra storage space for outdoor items, you really won't go wrong with this for the price.  The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the way the unit is assembled.
I go through at least one flag a year on my outdoor pole.  I leave it up 24/7 (lighted at night of course).  I was paying 30 - 35 dollars for a durable outside flag.  I thought I'd try this one.  For the price ($9.00), I got 2 figuring that I could get a year out of 2.  This is actually a nice flag.  The stars are embrodered and the colors are good and deep with double stitching.  It's not as heavy as the more expensive ones but it flies better in a lighter breeze.  The only problem is that it is NOT made in the US, but what is now?  Too Bad.
As a veteran of numerous hummingbird feeder, they tend to have several universals:  They are hard to fill without spilling, and they are hard to clean turning into bacterial growing grounds.  The Hummzinger 367 solves both of these.  It is exceedingly easy to clean and fill.  The top opens, and snaps back on.  There is a reservoir in the middle to trap any ants that covet the sugary solution, which has eliminated another bane of hummingbird feeder.The most important feature is that the humming birds love it!
I've used many different types of hummingbird feeders, and it isn't possible to get a better one than this three-portal Aspects model. Hummers fight like mad, so more ports are a waste. Sugar water naturally ferments fast in warm weather, so you don't need more capacity. The built in ant moat is pretty good against smallish ants, and is a freebie. The plastic construction won't break if you drop it on a rock or it blows off. And, it is so easy to rinse and fill.You simply cannot buy a better designed or better built hummingbird feeder.
I just received this item a couple of days ago and used it for the first time this morning.  It appears to be well-made, and I've found it easy to use.  My soil is very compacted and required that I use it "a step at a time" sometimes alternating each foot. Where the soil was softer I was able to insert the tines in multiple areas before taking a step forward, which made me able to cover more area.  It is a slow process so I am doing small sections at a time.  A larger, mechanical aerator would be nicer and quicker, but for this money this little Yard Butler suits my needs.  I realize that getting my lawn back up to standard is a work in progress and will take time.  I will update review after I've watered and treated the lawn, but for now I consider this a useful tool.  Best to use after a light rain.
I just used this after thatching my lawn of all the dead roots and grass.  After cleaning the soil, I watered the lawn.  Only then did I use this aerator.  Very simple to use. Just put your foot inside and step on the ground, and put your weight on it.  I walked around my lawn with this. It was not back breaking work.It did not compact your soil as others have mentioned.  If you watered the soil, and the soil is wet, it will put holes through the soil then pull up some soil.  It loosened up my top soil.  I then proceded to plant the grass seeds.  After 1 week, grass has started growing and evenly too. My lawn is starting to look good, nice and green.I highly recommend this.  Actually, the reason I bought this is because my neighbor has one, and he used it on his lawn.  His lawn looks great, so I just followed his lead.
Beautifully made, from the finish on the metal to the welds -- perfect! All around! I owned a lesser version of this kind of aerator tool once upon a time, and this Yard Butler aerator puts the old lesser version to shame! Every detail of this thing, from the design of the spikes to the handle has obviously been carefully and thoroughly thought out. I cannot imagine how you could improve upon this design. I want to call this a Cadillac but I'm not sure that Cadillacs are that well-made any more. This thing is PERFECT. Aerating your lawn is a big deal. Definitely worth the effort! This would make a very nice Father's Day gift.
CA is under severe drought this year. Several neighborhood cities have enforced water usage restrictions already. I am cutting down the frequency of  watering to my lawn. And I am using this aerator to improves water usage efficiency for my lawn as it helps water to go deeper into the soil through the holes on the ground.Though this aerator is sturdy and it's easy to use, however, it's a manual process. So, I think this aerator is more for a small area. To cover a large area, I think power aerator is a better choice.
Yard Butler IM-7C Spike Aerator does a great job of aerating your yard and garden.  The thick heavy duty spikes dig into the soil well, and the step guard over the top allows for evenly applied pressure with your foot.  The spikes are very sturdy and there's no need to worry about them bending while you work.  The handle is sturdy as well, offering a grip cover that helps keep a sturdy hold upon the tool while you're using it.If you've got an area that needs deep, aggressive aeration, this is the tool for you!
Manually aerating a large lawn with this would obviously be a lot of work and I would recommend renting a power aerator to do the job. In a smaller yard though or just to do a smaller or hard to reach area then this is what you need. This aerator was easy to use in my lawn and worked well for my needs. I will still be renting the power aerator to do the majority of my lawn, but this will be used to do the &#34;details&#34;. I would recommend this to anyone that has a smaller lawn or a lawn that has spot which may be hard to aerate with a power aerator.
I have clay soil. It immediately clogged the tines. You can keep making holes with the tines clogged, but since the soil is not being ejected, all you are doing is further compacting the soil below. You may think you are helping your lawn, but you are actually making it worse. I suspect this is a good tool if you have soil that is dry, or sandy, and therefore likely to eject from the top. With my type of soil, which is fairly common, it was basically useless. Please check your soil before spending your hard-earned money on this.
Yard Butler generally makes good products that I like. This, unfortunately, isn't one of them.I've got a small amount of lawn that gets lots of traffic, so this, if it worked, would make great sense.I tried using this with the lawn at various stages of moistness, in case that was the issue. In each instance the aerator jammed, repeatedly. In some cases, un-jamming the unit was very difficult. It is currently waiting for me to unjam it with a hammer drill and masonry bit.I don't recommend this unit.
My lawn is in pretty good shape but there are some areas under trees where the lawn suffers a bit.  I usually have my lawn aerated because of the size of the lawn for $30.  But I like this tool for breaking up the ground in spots where I need to plant new seed in bare spots.  I also like it for use in garden areas and other places where the large aeration machine can't reach.  I definitely cannot recommend this product for use on a regular size yard, even if you want the workout.  It clogs a little too often.
My soil is very hard and has a high clay content.  As a result, I have extremely poor drainage.  I sometimes get my lawn professionally aerated, but didn't this year.  I thought I'd give this tool a try.Important to note is that truly aerated the soil means taking out plugs of soil, to actually leave little holes, which helps to loosen the soil and give it better drainage.  This is not taking plugs out of the soil -- it is basically poking holes into it, and in some ways it is compacting the soil.  The angle of the handle on this is good, and it's easy enough to use...however, I notice a huge difference between what this tool does for my soil and what an actual aerator does for it...no comparison really.
I have used it on one area of my yard where the grass is a bit unhappy. I have clay soil and compaction is indeed a problem. The tool works as advertised but1) make sure the soil is moist otherwise, at least in my clay, it was quite difficult to drive through. Here's where I wish the foot rest was a bit wider so I can place both feet on when pressing down2) you're up for quite a bit of sweat as, even when the soil is moist, it does take quite a few &#34;diggings&#34; to cover even a small areaI have not yet figured out if it's OK to just leave the little soil pellets (that are the byproduct of using the tool) just on the grass. My 3 year old son warned me to watch out about walking on the goose poop. We'll that's pretty much what they look like. In about 3 weeks since I've used the aerator the pellets are still visible on the grass.
Tried this guy for the first time yesterday to aid some compacted areas in my lawn that my landscaper informed me about. This aerator works great, and it's really easy to operate. The coring tubes did get plugged up a bit, but I solved that with hosing them out. The height of the handles is really good (for me, anyways, I'm 5'3), and pushing the corer into the lawn is easy. If there's resistance, just put more of your weight onto the foot that's in the stirrup. If it still won't go, it's probably a tree root or a rock, which I discovered after a few bouts of unsavory words, thinking the aerator wasn't working. It was working fine, it was just a case of me being stupid.
My house is a new construction, so I have a lot of clay/dirt just under my sparse grass.  I used the coring aerator on part of my yard and the spike aerator on another section.  The spike aerator was a lot easier for me to use.  The coring aerator is good, but I had to really push down with my foot to get through all that clay/rocks.  I didn't bother removing the &#34;cores&#34; of dirt while I was working and they essentially just popped out as I kept coring.  I don't see much of a difference in the areas where I used a spike vs coring aerator.  The grass is coming along really nicely now, but I'll stick to the spike mostly because it's easier for me to use.
I was looking for a no-frills hose caddy. This caddy fits the bill at a reasonable price. This is a metal no-frills hose caddy.  I noticed that some reviewers mentioned that in their experience this caddy rusts. So when I received the caddy I closely examined its finish.  I see why it rusts prematurely: the finish has many imperfections and bare spots.  I am attaching a collage of 4 photos (they can be viewed by following customer photos link under the main photo) outlining several areas of defective finish. I painted the caddy with a clear coat acrylic paint before using to keep it rust free longer.  The caddy came without mounting hardware. On the positive side it is very sturdy.Here are the dimensions of the caddy:It has 10 inches spanIt is 5.5 inches wide3.25 inches from base to railOverall the design, sturdiness and price were what I was looking for. But I deducted a star for poor finish which required me to paint it before use.Ali Julia review
When the wheel works you don't always need to reinvent it to have a nice product. That's the concept that Yard Butler did here.With this hose mount you get solid construction, heavy weight design, but something practical that will hold up and last.Very easy to install two screws and you're done, though the screws are not included which isn't a big deal. I like the extra height on the front bar as it allows for more hose to be stored. I have zero complaints about this, solid and well made. Not sure what else you can ask for with this.
How well this device holds up depends on what kind of surface it is attached to.  It can be drilled into adobe or other wall surfacing like wood.  It should hold a 50' hose with no problem, or a longer electrical cord.  It's quite simple and made to keep a garden hose or cord from laying on the ground and being an obstacle.  How effective it is depends on how high off the ground it is and how secure it is mounted.  It does not come with any screws.
We have this at the back of our house and it looks really nice.  We decided to mount it to a mailbox post, instead of directly to the house, which I highly recommend.  It looks like the post came with it.  It's obviously easy to use, the hose doesn't fall off, and of course with two screw holes it was easy to install.  As other reviewers have noted it does not come with hardware - which was no biggie.The hanger does have a textured finish, which I like.  I didn't notice any spots that would be prone to rust, but when it was installed some of the paint got scraped and that small area has begun to rust.  So I would say if it's outside, be careful not to scratch it.
At last!  A nice, heavy hose hanger which looks good, and is capable of holding a lot of weight! I was skeptical when I bought it, but the reviews steered me back to this one. I am very pleased with it, and plan to buy two more quickly. I have a heavy 3/4 inch x 120 foot hose which will require two hangers near each other. The hanger will accept a #12 or similar size round head screw in order to anchor it to a wall stud-(not supplied with hanger- two required). This hanger is a gorilla, capable of holding much weight without bending. I strongly recommend it. Certainly more substantial than most other light gauge hangers seen in the stores, and at a decent price, too.
I was looking for something small and unobtrusive to hang the coil of garden hose on instead of letting it sit on the ground, and this serves its purpose well.  I have it attached to a fence rail and it's been sturdy and hasn't bent from yanking the hose off.The only thing I'm critical of is the eyes for the mounting screws - this isn't really something you're going to remove occasionally, so you really don't need the kind that has space for the screw head to fit through because if your screws aren't tight enough, it's going to pop off when you give it any kind of vertical lift while trying to pull the hose off.
This is one fine hunk of metal.  Sturdy.  The paint or whatever is both attractive and seems durable so far.  Maybe I&#8217;ll update this review in a decade when this unit has had a chance to weather.The amazing thing is that I can be so happy about something so simple.  So much of the stuff I buy seems designed to break.  This isn't.  I should make an entry in my will for it because it&#8217;ll outlast me.I&#8217;ll be getting more stuff from Yard Butler, as the needs arise, just to see if they make everything this well.  It&#8217;s so hard to find quality these days.Other than its sturdiness, there&#8217;s not much to say.  It&#8217;s a hose hanger.  It works.  Did I mention that it&#8217;s sturdy?
Softtouch Garden tools feel comfortable in my hand, they feel solid, and make working in the garden a pleasure.In the picture the handles look rather thick, but I have small hands and they are comfortable for me.  I like having the measurements on the back of the trowel, take out all the guessing.I noticed that the price on the on this garden tool set fluctuates. There is a nice online tool that I use to help catch a good price on Amazon, this tool is called  "Online Price Alert".  This tool will send you an email when the Amazon item price reaches the target price range that you specify. If you search on "online price alert" in Google it will be come up at the top.  I find this tool to be very helpful.I recommend this garden set without hesitation.
The new gardening season comes early to Texas. I recently bought this set and have been entirely pleased. They have a number of postive points to them. First they are made out of quality material that you can see and feel right away. Second they have, for me, the perfect combination of not being too heavy but also sturdy. Third the handles really are comfortable. For your flower/ vegetable planting and close maintenance this set is top of the line. I have seen many, many inferior tools for three times the price at big box stores. Highly recommended.
I bought these at $10. For 3 high-quality Fiskars tools, that is a fantastic value. The build quality is excellent. Rubber is thick and feels great in the hand. The aluminum is shiny, rust-proof, and extremely sturdy. The tools are very thick, but also very light-weight. I wasn't expecting the material to be so thick given the low price. I can't imagine these breaking during normal use (I have a small urban backyard garden plot of flowers and vegetables), but if they do, they are covered by a lifetime warranty.Do not hesitate. If you do any sort of gardening, order these tools. I am really happy I discovered this tool set. "Fiskars" is embossed in tiny letters along the orange part of the handle, but other than that, it's hard to tell these are Fiskars.They come in a plastic blister-pak that you'll have to cut open with scissors and discard. These really are great tools for the money.
Bought the first and liked them so much (as well as the great price given the quality), I bought a second set. This set represents the best of both worlds ----- the durability of aluminum combined with great rubberized hand grips. Aluminum is the way to go if you are looking for tools that are light weight that don't rust and will still look new ten years down the road. As for the hand grips, they offer stability and are far more comfortable than smooth handles and work really well when wearing gardening gloves. They also have holes in the handles which accomodate wall mounting from hooks. The smaller hand shovel has a depth indicator which is great for transplanting as well as digging edging channels. I use these daily on my gardens and rank these as the very best I've ever owned. I own a lot of Fiskar brand tools and appreciate the quality and thought reflected in their products.
This has been a great set for me to use in my garden.  I particularly enjoy the numbers on the one trowel when I'm planting tulips and other bulbs in the fall (particularly since I've lost my bulb planter!) and the other two, well, I just use them all the time.  Like another reviewer said, you really cannot use these in thick, heavy soil because they WILL break.  However, if the soil is that heavy, you should be using a garden shovel anyway to loosen up the soil.Just a very nice set, rivals my solid stainless steel ones!  Recommend!
hello,everyone knows about fiskars quality scissors.  these are no different, they are top quality.  they are very well made and the grips are so comfortable that it makes garden work fabulously easy.  one hand shovel is good for moving a lot of dirt.  the other is sharper and is good to cut various wild roots.  the rake is used very little, but was included in the three pack of tools.  the two shovels get a good workout in the garden.  fiskar products are tops and this three piece tool set is right up there for necessary tools for your garden.  great product, service and delivery.
This is a nice set and very strong.  My old trowels always end up bending when I try to force out some tough dirt.  This one stays strong and straight.  The same is true of the rake and transplanting shovel.  I am not a huge fan of the black handles, which get easily lost when tossed down in a messy yard.  They are chromed out pretty well, so I hope they don't rust.  I'll update this if they start to rust or show abnormal wear.  Also, the handles are pretty thick, which I assume is good for arthritic hands, but my 5 year old daughter had difficult grasping them.
Fiskars 7067 set of three garden tools is likely the best set of tools for the price.  Make of aluminum with rubberized grip handles, the blades and tines will not rust, and the handles are comfortable.  This set will last decades if not abused (putting too much pressure on handle and bending spade).  These work best in sandy or loose soils.  Heavy clay soils require stronger tools than these.  The planting spade is so well designed.  It is calibrated in inches so one knows how deep to plant bulbs!  What a great tool!  The small three-tined weeder is perfect for cultivating around plants.Don't borrow these out, for you may not get them back!kone
I have found Fiskar's products to be quite reliable, and this little set is no exception. They are just the right size for home gardening, and are very durable. In fact, i have left them out in the rain a few times (stupid rememberer aint remembering properly all the time, lol), to no ill effect. Realistically, if you are looking for a simple set that will allow you to tend a personal garden, you could do much worse than this, and spend quite a bit more at the same time.I would buy this set again, but i cant imagine these will ever wear out enough to require a second set.
replacement blades hard to find. most edger blades are 9", on this unit standard and universal blades won't fit, so you have to spend $11 plus shipping to order their 7 1/2" blades. another reviewer said he found 7 1/2" blades are local mom and pops stores were you can find them. I called local mom and pops stores and lawn mover parts stores , Homedepot and Lowes, and looked on internet and can not find any edger blades that fit this model except the $11 plus shipping for Poulan. To make matters worse, the $11 blade wears out very fast. only worked one time on med size yard. would not recommend due to this blade issue.updated: finally found replacement blades at a different Lowes store, two blades for $10. so change back to five stars
Well, it worked for a little over a year. I used the trimmer twice a month with no issues.I noticed the blade was getting worn down and quite dull. Changing the blade proved to be the downfall of the trimmer.To change the blade you insert a screwdriver in the slot behind the blade to lock the hub. The metal around this hub is very cheap pot metal. The metal hub broke apart in 7 pieces when trying to remove the blade nut.I hope everyone has better luck than me, but I won't buy another one.I'm kinda miffed that this trimmer only lasted 13 months. They shouldn't be disposable.
Highest quality and just simply works as it should! Can't go wrong with this product. I got a great deal on it when I purchased it from Amazon. If you use a weed trimmer to edge you yard you need to stop and buy one of these attachments and do it right. Weed trimmers will do a lot of harm when used incorrectly. These lawn edgers will allow you to only remove just the amount of dirt with the grass that is needed as compared to weed trimmers used incorrectly. I had someone take care of my edging last summer and he used a weed trimmer to do the edging and what started out being a nice 1/2" border ended up being a 3" border by the end of summer. I had to buy several bags of top soil to replace the dirt that the weed trimmer threw to the wind. Great product and a great buy on Amazon.
Wasn't sure how to rate the product since it seems well made.  My only problem is that I have never caught a mouse in it.  To be fair, the mice around here are sporadic so it's not like they're all around and this doesn't work.  I bought this product during a time I was finding a few in the garage and I decided to go all out on them.  I don't see why it wouldn't catch mice but for now, the regular wood ones serve my needs.
I bought three different kinds of mouse traps for some mice that managed to find a way into our home. I set this one up last night. I was very hopeful yet extremely skeptical of this product to see if itd actually work. Sure enough some time last night a mouse wondered in for our peanut butter and ZAP! Dead mouse. This one was super easy to set and worked like a charm. I am using 4 AA energizer rechargeable batteries. Hopefully these hold up long enough to kill any other mouse that may be left. They are a bit expensive for a mouse trap but there is absolutely no mess! that is pretty nice.
We had been using more conventional mechanical traps, which would occasionally leave a half-crushed, yet still living, mouse waiting for me in the morning. I found this very inhumane and looked for a trap that would always instantly kill. This trap is it. It's humane, it is "clean" in that it doesn't leave parts of the mouse stuck to the trap. I would say this trap is very good for indoor use (garage, crawl space etc.) but not the final word for yard use. Perhaps with suitable covering? This trap works as advertised for us.
First night didn't catch any mouse. The second night caught one. Third night caught two little ones. On fourth day I heard a mouse in my room while I was sleeping  and put the trap by my door and crumbled a small cookie by the traps entrance. Five minutes later I hear the mouse walking inside and zap! It was a huge mouse compared to the others. So far it's been 3 days and have yet to catch another. Ether they got scared or we don't have anymore. Next time I'll remember to close the basement window .
Love, Love, Love these traps.  Quick and humane ... well as humane as killing something can get.  Easy to bait (I use peanut butter) and easy to clean old bait out of.  We needed these last winter and I bought 3.  They caught 3 mice last year and have already caught one this years.  Since cool weather is coming the critters are trying to find places to overwinter.  Well, not in my pantry.  Didn't need to replace the batteries and I check them once a week to be sure they're still working. So nice NOT to have the mess of the snap traps and sometimes they don't completely kill the poor thing.  Glue traps are horrible and cruel.  If you haven't tried these you really should.  If I ever need any more I'll certainly buy these.
Pros:- Compact, sturdy, easy to setupCons:- Expensive- Very hard to clean the peanut butter out of the unit- Given the above, actual reusability and longevity is in questionMy major gripe on this product is how hard it is to clean. The peanut butter can't sit in there forever, eventually it gets a little rotten and you don't want that smell in your house so it has to be cleaned. The peanut butter, once smeared to the back wall, is imbedded into the vent holes and into the cracks and corners of the inside compartment. I bought 2 units and each unit took me 20 minutes to clean with a bunch of toothpicks, qtips anda bottle of rubbing alcohol. Not well designed with this in mind at all and at this price point, I expect more. Perhaps the sellers are just hoping you'll give up and throw it out so you can buy another one from them? It's cynical to think so but go ahead and try cleaning one and you'll likely agree with me.
This is a great sprayer that is super easy to use and can be adjusted for use in multiple applications. Twist the handle to unlock/unscrew the lid to fill it, then screw it back on. Turn the handle slightly counter clockwise to unlock the pump and I give it about 10 solid pumps. Be sure to push the handle all the way back down and twist again to lock into place. Very important.+ Perfect Size+ Not too heavy+ Easy to Use, Refill, Carry+ Price+ Really Sprays with Impressive Pressure+ Adjustable Spray Stream_Bottom Line_ Yes, I would recommend this to a friend. I cannot think of anything I do not like about it and I have had it for over 6 months. It works great and is offered at a great price.
I've used this to spray a lot of shrubs and trees.  It's a good size.  If it were bigger, it would be heavier than I'd like.I found that when this tank is completely full, one can't pump much pressure since there's nowhere for the air to go.  As it the level goes down, it gets easy to pump enough pressure into it.I like the spray handle.  It seems perfect for something this size.  I appreciate the low price at the time of my purchase.
Several parts were missing--including the spray guard and measure cup, and the &#34;tool holder.&#34; Yes, I checked the box to make sure--the parts were definitely missing.We put it together anyway and my husband showed me how to use it, but I'm returning it (and not replacing it) because my husband said his from Home Depot feels more secure--the lid locks into place more and seems a little better quality (to be fair, I don't know how much it was or what brand it was). Just going to use his (after washing it) or get the same one. Not worth the hassle of waiting for the replacement, and my roses need the fungicide sprayed before then!Disappointed that so many parts were missing. But maybe I lucked out by using a more secure one.
In order to unlock the pump handle you have to turn the handle the same direction as you&#8217;d turn it to open the lid thus releasing any air still sealed in the reservoir and misting your hands with the chemical in the reservoir.  So, once you have the pump handle unlocked you have to wedge your fingers down onto the collar and twist it to re-seal the lid.  Then you pump it up, press the handle back down and lock it back in place.  You have to go through this process every time you want to pump the reservoir back up.  I returned this item the same day I opened it.
I bought an 18 volt lithium ion cordless trimmer (similar to this modelGreenworks 21602 20-Volt Lithium Ion 12-Inch Cordless Electric String Trimmer/Edger with 6 Amp-Hour Extended Run-Time Lithium Ion Battery & Charger)that came with a sample reel of regular, round, trimmer line.  As I read through reviews, several people had suggested this Cyclone 6-sided trimmer line to improve the cordless trimmer's performance.Boy, were they right!  This really makes a significant difference, especially when you're trimming borders (like patio to grass).  I can actually cut into the dirt with my cordless trimmer, making a beautifully distinct line between the patio and the yard.  It also improved trimming speed (overall job time) & it powered through some heavy overgrowth of St. Augustine grass along a curbline.Highly recommended, especially for cordless trimmer owners.  Power up!
We bought this natural fertilizer mainly following the recommendations of hobby gardener friends.  We did read some Amazon reviews.  Blind believers, once the small bag arrived (different from the Amazon image / supplier), we applied the Azomite first, studying the facts afterwards.  Not sure which surprised us more?  While not overnight, plant growth and vigor were perceptible amazingly fast; almost dramatically.  Either the soils had been depleted prior to the Azomite application or the added nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium did wonders.  Be it as it may, we bought a much larger bag.  Highly recommended.
I live in an area with sand, not soil so I am adding it to the compost I make. It will be at least a few months before I might see any results. I just wanted to post to anyone thinking of using it in a sandy soil area w/ lots of seasonal rain, you may want to think twice about using directly on soil. Will likely percolate through before doing any good. Mix it first with a good organic media at the least. From what I have researched I expect to see good results of the product.
Bought this to mix in with my soil that I was using in 2 earth boxes.  One box has herbs the other box has a small pepper plant, basil and a pepper plant that was cut down to the stem as my dog had ate it before i could plant it.  The herbs are doing ok not much better that a box I planted not using the azomite.  Some of the herbs have taken off while some are growing at a reasonable pace.  The box with the peppers and sage are doing no better than if I had not used them.  It has been 3 weeks since I planted and in my mind everything is growing at the expected pace.  The one thing I was hoping for is that my pepper plant that was chewed up would make a recovery which dispite all I have done fo it looks like it will die.  I do plan on using again to ammend the soil for my front yard raised bed that has all flowers hopefully i will get bigger blooms.
This is a nicely constructed product - looks like it will last for some time. As the other reviewers have said, it is a very handy tool to have for yard cleanup, and it collapses down quickly and easily for storage.It does NOT, however, come with a shoulder strap as noted in the photo and description. I ordered one from Amazon. It arrived in fine shape, was 100% new and unused, but no strap! I returned it, and re-ordered another. The replacement also lacked a strap. The product info sheet that comes with the item makes no mention of a strap, so I imagine Toro stopped including one to save costs.The lack of a strap is not a deal-breaker for my purposes, but it would be a handy addition. If you order one, keep in mind that you will not get the strap.
I have been using the 17" hedge trimmer for couple of years. The 17" hedge trimmer can only trim branches up to 3/8" and this is a very annoying limitation.This 24" is far more better and powerful. First, the longer trimmer length indeed reduces the trimming time. Secondly, it easily cuts through 1/2" branches. For 3/4" branches, it takes a little while, but it still cuts them through (just hold the trimmer steady). Finally, it's still pretty light for long holding.Overall, this product fits my expectation very well.The product arrives with manufacturer's original box. That box does not hold up well during the shipment. Luckily, the trimmer itself does not get damaged. But I take 1 point out for that.
I received mine on August 13, 2009 (two days with Prime) and on the 14th, proceeded to trim the hedges and a Chinese Holly. Well, after about two hours of work, everything was done both properly and quickly. The HedgeHog didn't exhibit any vibration problems nor did it get stuck on the thickest branches. It was relatively quiet as well. This fall or winter, I plan on trimming several other plants with this really efficient trimmer. Hats off to Black & Decker!!(I used to use a Craftsman 18" unit which seemed to *constantly* get stuck on several branches. No more!!!) I should add, the longer reach of the HedgeHog meant far less work.
Beside it's rock-solid construction and excellent versatility, the BON-AIRE Original Ultimate Nozzle's easy grip and silky-smooth action make it an absolute MUST for anyone who suffers from arthritic fingers and/or wrist impairment. No triggers to squeeze means there's no strain on the hands or wrists.The easy action of the nozzle makes this a perfect gift for the gardener in your life !!!The Bon-Aire easily provides a wide range of spray patterns -- from a fine spray to a pinpoint blast that easily travels 40 feet-- and you can use it as a bubbler, too !!!After several seasons of hard use, the Bon-Aire hose nozzles perform perfectly -- and they are  definitely worth every penny !!!UPDATE- 19 April, 2014 -- STILL going strong with no problems of any kind !! The nozzle seems to be indestructable, and it still works perfectly !! Highly recommended.
I've used many different types of hose nozzles.  Some seemed to start out ok, but failed after a short time.  This BonAire nozzle is very ruggedly constructed with a smooth adjustment mechanism.  The spray patterns are very even, though you won't get a really hard, narrow jet out of it.  What I like is that it will stay in the position I set it at and that it will shut off in either direction.  I expect to be using this nozzle for years to come.
The Good:  I bought this to accompany a new Karcher 2700PSI gas pressure washer.  It works as advertised and cut the time to clean my driveway and patio noticeably.  The construction seems flimsy at first bit in reality it is very well made.  I have used it at least 6 time and every time it performs well.The Bad:  I honestly have not found anything worth complaining about with this model.  The instructions might have been slightly better written, but that is just whining on my part.  I was able to figure it out soon enough that it wasn't a big deal.
Stumbled on to this unit when I was researching power washers on Amazon.  I broke down and bought one for use with my running poorly older power washer.  All I can say is:  I wish I would have had this years ago.  What a time saving life saver.I have only used it once as a test and can not believe it.  It works great with the old washer, so great that I am now waiting for my new Generac Power Washer to arrive.Don't hesitate.  If you do any power washing of decks, driveways, sidewalks, etc., buy this unit!!!!
I have bought these from other sellers. Bad experience with other sellers. But not this one!!!!!Tips: If they take longer than 1 minute to absorb water. They are old stock. Happened with other seller.Some are bad stock with Fungus Gnat eggs mixed in while processing the pellets. YUCK Gnat larvae eating my seeds. Then they turn into Fungus gnat flies. Yuck yuck!  Not this seller!So basically, I in the future have learned my lesson and will remain loyal to this seller.No I am not making this up. You can see my other reviews on the bad ones.
This feeder is a darker green than pictured, which is fine. The standard outdoor-furniture hunter green works well.It holds a ton of seeds, is very easy to refill (flip the top up, pour seeds in) and you can adjust the feed holes at the bottom for small seeds up to small sunflower seed.  I wouldn't suggest using full sized sunflower seed, but the small black stuff (bigger than niger seed) seems to work well.  You can lift the whole feeder off the suction cup hanger to clean it, and the base toggles loose so you can really scrub it.  Very well designed, despite being lightweight plastic.The birds only took one day to find these feeders when I replaced their old clear plastic bucket-style ones and the suction cups are quite strong when placed on clean glass.Minus one star for the quality of the green plastic, but it should hold up fine to the weight of birds!
Go to You Tube and watch the "Sprout People" video and you will see how easy this is to use. Like most people, I have tried most of the sprouting methods and trays on the market. This is too easy. Three TB of seeds (Sprout House seeds),The Sprout House Organic Sprouting Seeds Broccoli 1 Poundinto the container. Rinse a couple times a day, swirl to shake off most of the water and put them back up on the window ledge. 5-6 days later you have great sprouts. The best thing about this is that you can store the finished sprouts right in the container in the refrigerator and they last for about 2 weeks. That is, they WOULD last that long, but we eat them on everything and they're gone long before that. I have 4 sprouters going all the time, a few days apart so we never run out. A sandwich isn't complete without them. Do yourself a favor and get the OXO mini salad spinner too. Perfect for the final rinse.
This design is the best.As long as your seeds are viable, these sprouters make growing fresh sprouts unbelievably easy.Now, instead of purchasing bland, expensive alfalfa sprouts in the grocery store, which is often all that's available, we can grow fresh mixes that have more flavor and crunch.They're wonderful on sandwiches and add a lot to salads.We eat a lot of salads, especially in the summer months and our climate is too hot to grow most lettuces during the summer.Growing our own sprouts allows us to add nutrition and interest to simple meals year round.Years ago, I used the jar method, but nothing I've tried works as well as these simple sprouters.  They truly are Easy Sprouters.

I would love to review this product, but one of the pieces arrived broken and there's no number or address to ask for a replacement part!  I've informed Amazon, but it's been almost a week and no reply.  So, here's what I can tell you.  The bench looks beautiful.  Nice, dark wood and looks very sturdy when assembled correctly.  But I would never buy another product from this company as there is no way to get a hold of them when a piece is broken or missing!
When you open the package for this bench, it's intimidating because there are so many bolts and such.  Also, the instructions are not helpful at all. Fortunately, my husband is pretty good at assembling products, but if that's not a skill that comes intuitively for you, you might have a hard time with this.  Also, I hope your wrists are strong or that you have some sort of electric drill; assembling this requires a lot of wrist use.Once put together, though, it seems sturdy and looks nice(I'm surprised at all the reviews to the contrary; I'm quite picky, and I think it looks fine).
I really can't give this item a fair review simply because when I opened the box, one of the legs was broken. I was so disappointed as this was going to go in my garden surrounded by flower trees and pretty plants. I am very disappointed because this was a Vine selection, and I know the chances of getting it replaced are nearly 0. If I had something good to say about this product is that the photo does it no justice. The wood is a sort of pretty cherry wood, or at least that is what it looks like. of course assembly is required.  I have no doubt that who ever orders this and receives it with no broken pieces will be very pleased with it. So disappointed.,
Everything is packed nice and tight inside the box, so there is no internal movement before opening (which reduces the chance of scratches).The fire pit was very easy to assemble.  It took my husband about 15 minutes.  The manufacturer even included extra screws, though the extras were too short.  I love that his is heavy duty.  We have a lot of high-wind days, and this fire pit stays put -- no chance of it blowing away, even on the windiest of days (although if I lived in hurricane alley, I'd bring it in during a hurricane).The only thing I would change is the cover...  I would prefer the cover have an elastic edge, to keep it firmly on my new fire pit during the windy days.  As it is, the cover doesn't serve much purpose if one lives in a windy climate, like I do.  I'm going to buy theVeranda 44-Inch Round Fire Pit Coverto cover my my fire pit.
This fire pit is very well constructed, & should hold up for quite a while.  It's a great addition to any outdoor gathering!  Assembly is easy, even for the most mechanically challenged.  I am concerned, as a few others here have noted, that the legs & lid may rust, so I'd recommend covering it, &/or putting in a shed/garage when not in use to prolong the life of this product.Overall, this is a great product that should add enjoyment to any backyard, or camping trip.  Recommended!
This is a very nice heavy-duty firepit. The only problem with it is that the screened lid is just not high enough to allow the burning of enough wood. So, I keep having to remove the lid to add wood. There are replacement covers that are much more rounded and higher.I like the edge all around that allows you to put your feet on it when the fire has burned down a bit. The cast iron construction will allow this unit to last for many years.Every year, I wire brush the screen lid and spray paint with black fire resistant grill paint and it lasts all season.
This is a good, solid fire pit that throws off a lot of heat for your outdoor gatherings. The shape allows for seating on all sides.  I can't say that this is the most attractive finish I've ever seen, but it's simple, and the pit does the job its intended to do, so I can't really complain.The biggest problem is that it rusts.  The lid rusts very quickly, and I fear the legs are going to follow.  The cover didn't help protect it from our spring rains.  I fear it's going to take constant wire-brushing to keep it clean, and a coat of rust-protecting paint at some point.  Or, I can schlep it into the garage once it's cooled down.  That's kind of a pain considering the weight.
I really like this fire pit.  I think it is attractive and durable.  6 months ago I had purchased a $60 model at *arget and I am grateful that I got this one.  I let my husband put it together and he had no trouble as he is good with putting things together.  It is much more heavy than my last pit and much sweeter to look at.  I like the cover, make sure you have let it cool down before you put it on.  We have it on solid stone so we haven't had a rust issue yet.
i have a dog that likes digging in the most unwanted places. Recently, the dog started digging a hole right in front of the front door! I tried everything to stop the dog , nothing worked. Finally, i poured some of the Havahart critter ridder into the hole - it worked wonders.My dog not only stopped digging that whole, she gives the front door a wide berth. The packaging of the repellent is also well thought, it comes in a plastic container that has a pop-up dispenser which you can close by pressing down after use.It is tightly sealed, so unwanted pouring out is prevented. This definitley keeps DOGS away from unwanted places.
While I do not mind the cats or occasional squirrel in the backyard I do mind the racoons.They are smart big and so clumsy that they can wake me from a not too deep sleep while going about the garden hitting and banging and bumping their way through the night.However, I do not want to hurt them just kind of shoo them away.  I keep Food for them on the outside of the fence but that is never enough. So I am grateful for something other than the cayene pepper a neighbor suggested to move them along without any injury to the animals or the garden itself.It was easy to apply and lasted well into the season and there were no victims or problems.That is a clearly successful product to me.
I got this for the crawl space under my parents cabin.  I wanted something safe for when the kids are playing, but strong enough to chase away critters.  My parents are mostly concerned about skunks and the occasional groundhog or woodchuck.The odor is strong and peppery, but much better than skunk spray.  I think you have to stay on top of applciations because the damp soil/earth will probbaly reduce the potency.So far so good and it seems to be doing its job.  I wish it were a little less expensive, but then again professionals are much more expensive.
I live on an acre lot in a rural subdivision. White-tail Deer are a daily nuisance inthe neighborhood and over the spring and summer, I used Deer Off to help protectazaleas, day lilies, and other ornamental plants around the yard.During this time deer continued to come into the yard on a regular basis but theydid not nibble on the treated plants nearly as much as when I left them untreated inearlier years.I tried the Critter Ridder granules around my back deck where we keep ourtrashcans and recycling. Raccoons, skunks, and oppossums are all attracted to thisarea. While I've been using Critter Ridder, I've not had them get into the trash at all.I applied the granules to create a 1 to 2 foot wide barrier around the deck and alsosprinkled some under the deck around the cans. I did this roughly once a month.The shaker can is easy to use and it only took a few minutes to spread the granules.
I have flowers planted on the opposite side of our sidewalk next to two trees which are a magnet for male dogs. It makes me disgusted that people let their dogs urinate on my lovely flowers, but I can't stand guard 24/7, so I decided to try this product.I must say again, I cannot watch 100% of the time, but each time I've seen someone walk their dog past, they have not stopped to do their business on my flowers anymore since using Critter Ridder. The best part is that this product is mostly made from hot pepper, so there's no harmful chemicals or nasty ingredients going into the soil. I would definitely recommend this product.
There is a neighborhood cat that likes to use our yard as its litter box. I have been very frustrated by this problem for a long time. A few weeks ago I sprinkled some of this stuff in the areas I have seen the cat hang out and so far so good. I haven't seen any evidence of the cat leaving its "calling card" in our yard. I like the convenience of this product. The granular pellets are easy to scatter around the yard. I don't have to deal with a messy, smelly liquid that I have to spray all over the yard. I just grab a handful of this stuff and scatter it around. Couldn't be any easier. It has yet to be determined how effective it will be over the long run. I will update my review when more time has passed. Like most other animal deterrent products, you have to reapply after heavy rains. The biggest drawback of this product is the price. Hopefully the price will come down and make it more affordable.
This Havahart "Critter Ridder" is effective at repelling the animals that make a habit of frequenting my low, rock fence line, most notably squirrels, rabbits, squirrels, and the nasty little dog that the neighbor likes to let do it's "business" in my yard. This applies easily from the shaker bottle and seems to last about two weeks for us but we did have several very powerful rain storms come through, which will reduce the effectiveness.I am hoping that a few applications of this will condition the pests to seek other areas where they can frolic, away from my plants and not befouling my yard.Recommended!CFH
This product works to keep critters out of specific areas, but seems to only work directly where it is applied.I was hoping to also use it as perimeter control, sprinkling around my barn to keep out cats, skunks, etc. However as a perimeter control it didn't seem to work.When I applied directly to the corners in the barn that were being used for nesting it cleared out those areas, but the critters found somewhere else to make a home. I kept tracking these areas down and applying more repellent and eventually it seems the critters are gone.
I got this in hopes it would stop the rabbits in my yard.  I applied it as directed in paths of the critters.  I did not notice ANY improvement, nor did my cocker spaniel seem to stop at it's locations.  I wish I could report it works well, but not for me id doesn't.  My imagination says it kept them at bay for maybe a day, but a no rain day later, things were back to the way they were.  I think it was my imagination.  I have not had luck with any product.  Nothing more to say about this - it failed me.
I've had problems with coyotes, wild hares, skunks, opossums, gophers, mice, and neighbors' cats messing up my front/backyard lawns and gardens. I spread thisHavahart Critter Ridder 3146 Animal Repellent, 5-Pounds Granular Shakeraround areas where I've seen those critters frequent and caused damage. After about two weeks, I haven't seen any new damage caused by those annoying critters/intruders.  The granules are easy to dispense; similar to a giant pepper shaker. The granules' aroma is not too offensive; smells like strong black pepper and doesn't bother our family or guests.  The only drawback is the rather high cost of $27.50/5 lbs.; I've already used about half the container to apply one application to my front and backyards. The claims of rain-resistance and 30 days effectiveness remains to be seen.
I was hoping that this product would keep the squirrels out of the fruit trees, but it didn't phase them.One of our pear trees is far enough from other trees that they can't just jump from tree to tree, so I decided to try this product around it.  Less than an hour after applying the product all around the tree, the squirrels were crossing the band to climb and retrieve fruit.Other reviews seem to indicate that it work from some people in some situations, but our squirrels are determined to strip the fruit from every tree and this product didn't stop or slow that process.
I got this product hoping it woud keep squirrels away from my bird feeders. I have six squirrel proof bird feeders. My squirrels, Mensa members all, have figured out how to overcome the "squirrel proofing" and eat the bird food until the feeders are completely empty. I placed generous amounts of Critter No-Ridder under each of my feeders. As soon as I walked away the squirrels were back and I could hear them giggling and winking at each other as they brushed away the No-Ridder whle giving me knowing glances. This is a genuinely useless product, at least as far as squirrels are concerned.
The screens around the pool and deck were breeched.  Finding that a raccoon (in the middle of the night right outside my door) had come in was bad.  Finding that the raccoon had found the cat flap and gotten into the house was much worse.  I had a broken arm the first time and still I went after him swinging a broom and stomping loudly on the reverberating deck.  Yes, he was scared.  He was so scared that he didn't look where he was going and landed in the pool.  He came back a few nights later.  Finally I set a trap with a chicken leg tied in the back over the trip plate.  He was so annoyed that he tossed and turned and moved that trap 15 feet from where I had left it and in turning it over - escaped.I put critter ridder outside on his avenue of approach and carnage.  NO FURTHER INVASIONS !!!Nuf said?
This gentle and all-natural organic Havahart Critter Ridder 3146 formula repels by taste and odor groundhogs, skunks, dogs, cats, squirrels, raccoons, chipmunks and other nuisance animals unless they are starving or otherwise out of normal control, e.g. rabid.  This is not an industrial repellent working against anything that walks, but rather for the suburban home and garden use.  Its oil of black pepper, peperine and capsaicin are not offensive to people and applicable not only in gardens, lawns, and landscaped areas, but also basements, cellars, and storage.
I was excited to try this, as I've had raccoons knocking over my garbage and recycling cans for weeks this summer. I followed the directions and applied lots of this all around the area where my garbage is, even sprinkling a little in the garbage for good measure. I closed the lids tight. That same night, it was worse than ever-- garbage knocked over, trash all over the side of my house. By the time I saw it, there were flies swarming and birds picking through it... meaning that I guess flies and birds don't mind this repellent either!It would be one star except that I do like the idea that it's safe and approved for organic gardens-- but it's clearly not effective in all cases.It leaves a peppery smell in the area, and you're advised to wear gloves while applying it.
I I have a skunk that has taken up residence under my sidewalk. I tried replacing the soil and gravel that it was excavating. It just kept digging. I covered its entrance with bricks, it just pushed them aside.Then I found this Cridder Ridder, which seems like just what i needed. I pourted it all around the perimeter of the side walk.So the skunk is just working hard at coverpowering the spicey smell of the Critter Ridder with it's own scent...The strongest skunk odor I have ever experienced!This may work with deer, but apparently not skunks!
We have problems with deer, raccoons, possums, groundhogs and more, eating grapes off our vines and flowers out of the garden. I sprinkled CRITTER RIDDER liberally around both areas, and was really pleased for several days. I could literally watch the deer completely avoid both areas. Unfortunately about five days later we had several days straight of on and off heavy rains, and before I could re-apply the product, the grapes disappeared. Perhaps the product would work better in a drier climate than what we have, as I can see the cost being prohibitive if I have to re-apply it every week or so.When it worked, it worked great. But rain is NOT your friend when it comes to Critter Ridder.
It is hard to tell if any animal deterrent is actually working, but there seem to be no more cat droppings in the areas I used this. It has a peppery smell which is an irritant. This is obviously how it works. In areas that do not get rained on the odor, and presumably the effectiveness seems to last (several weeks now).  In areas that get rain (or watered) then smell goes away quickly, but it still seems effective. This may be due to the training of the cats to stay away even after the smell dissipates.The shaker container is easy to use and stays closed/sealed between applications.So far, so good.
We have a vegetable garden - tomatoes, cucumber, basil, parsley, rosemary, and mint.  I have seen woodchucks, deer and a groundhog munching on my garden.  We have tried several things in the past to deter them.  The rosemary actually worked to deter the deer, but the woodchucks and groundhog kept coming back.This stuff smells terrible - like a very strong black pepper.  We shook it around the perimeter of our 25 x 15 garden.  We reapply after each rainstorm.  After a week of use, we have not seen any more woodchucks or groundhogs - they were previously daily visitors.So, I would say that this works.  However, it need to be reapplied often (certainly after any rain).  It is quite an expensive solution.
Although the product says its formula is proprietary, it leans heavily on red and black pepper. I have used these same ingredients to keep cats (off the porch) and squirrels (off the birdhouses) away. I have discovered that, like this, it is sometimes effective. Most animals do not like pepper and will learn to stay away. However, there are some--not many--who do not have the aversion.The one thing I particularly like about this product is that the granular shaker bottle makes it easy to spread the product as well as store it. It's much cheaper to buy red and black pepper, but this is definitely a more convenient solution.
I use this Critter Ridder to keep animals away from my koi pond and veggie garden.  This item works much better than fox urine at keeping pests away.  I had a problem with animals eating my koi.  I did find that it has not kept stray cats away; however, I have not lost one koi since I started using Critter Ridder.  I was losing at least one fish a month before using the product. Fox urine alone wasn't keeping the pests away.  I recommend this product and I will use it again.
I sprinkled this around my tomatoes and bean plants to stop the deer and squirrels from ruining my garden. So far, this has stopped the critter destruction and thievery.  I am finally getting to harvest my tomatoes and it looks like my bean plants are starting to grow again.  I like that this is not so horribly scented as some of the other products on the market.  This has a very strong black pepper smell instead of a rotting garlic smell. It seems to work as well as many of the other products out there. It has a convenient shaker lid. This is definitely a product worth getting.
We have a variety of animals in our neighborhood including deer, squirrels, rabbits, birds, etc.  And, that doesn't count the pet varieties.  We wanted a way to keep the animals, especially the deer, away from our plants.  They come off a park behind the houses across the street from us, go through our yard, and then scatter through the neighborhood.  This product did okay, but it washes away with the rain (which occurs quite a bit) and it needs to be reapplied.
I ordered this because I needed to find something that would keep Lady, my black lab mix dog, out of the garbage.  The mice like to burrow underneath the garbage cans, and Lady loves to dig, trying to get to the mice.  This worked.  In fact, after the first application, she tried to dig under the garbage cans, and she looked at me in disgust and walked away.  Unfortunately, this only worked a week, instead of the 30 days promised.  Lady is back to digging.If this had worked for the full 30 days, I would have bought a year supply of it, just to keep Lady away from the outside garbage cans.  Unfortunately, it is too expensive to apply every week.  I'm still searching for the perfect product.
I am always trying to keep the dogs away from the garden and short of putting up an entire fence they just wont leave it alone. I will be honest I was quite skeptical about how good this product would work but I ordered it anyways. Boy am I glad I did. They have stayed away from the garden ever since I laid it down. The only time they went close to it was after a hard rain but once I laid down another layer they stayed away. Great product that I would highly recommend!
This is a great Animal Repellent that uses Pepper to keep areas safe. It can last up to 30 days depending on your weather. Also any digging, watering or anything that disrupts to ground will affect the coverage and duration.It works by affecting the animals sense of smell and taste with hot pepper and by getting it on their skin and in their eyes. In fact, one way to use this to take some table scraps and cover them with it. Once that skunk or opossum tastes this hot pepper, it will go elsewhere for it's next meal. Also keep in mind that open sources of water and food are what draw in such animals, so if those are still present, you will get other animals coming to the location.This also works to keep cats from using your flower beds as a bathroom, you can shake it over your birdseed to keep squirrels out as birds can't taste hot pepper and it is a non-chemical way to protect your vegetable garden from animals eating your crops.
I had high hopes for Havahart's Critter Ridder.  I live in a neighborhood that doesn't really have any public space to it, so you often find people that walk their pets and use your lawn without respecting their neighbor's to clean it up.  There are also a few pets that roam freely and have their pick of lawns.  I used Critter Ridder around the edges of the lawn to create a border.  Most dogs appear to have just walked over the border of repellent and continued to use my lawn.  They didn't even appear to be affected by the repellent, so it wouldn't have helped to spread it over a larger area.I'm sure some pets might have not like the repellent, but I definitely could not recommend this as a general purpose solution.  There were too many breeds and kinds of dogs in my yard, even the very next day after using this.
This DOES DOES DOES repel just about every critter! I put it along my tree line and it repelled the neighbor's pug who loves to dump in our yard. Also, the folks across the street have a cat that loves to poopy in our garden. With this stuff, no issues! The only reason I took off a star is because (to me) it's expensive and it does NOT last 30 days. I suppose if it never rained, it might last three weeks. Maybe..maybe four?? Now if they would just make something to keep my Beagle from running off..because at top speed, this doesn't keep her in the yard! (No, I don't expect it to..just dreaming...)
I got this b/c we have Beagles who keep digging out, so I spread it along the base of the fence.  It has a nice pour spout that pops out of the top and handle, so that makes it very easy to spread, although it does come out quickly b/c the pour spout opening is quite large.  It is the consistency of sand, so it's not visible once it's spread on the ground.  It's been about 1 week and so far it seems to be working, our dogs and the neighbor dogs on the other side of the fence have been avoiding that area and our dogs have not attempted to dig anywhere near the fence where the granuals are spread.
This is a scent-based animal repellent.  Cats, raccoons and opossums come into my yard over the fence, or under it, and I sprinkled this product near their entry points.  They avoid it for about a week, but I find they tend to enter at other places; if they are coming to feed or to bother my cat, they wreak their havoc anyway.  Water, either sprinklers or rain, completely inactivates the product.I don't use scent-based repellents much any more.  If I were trying to protect a very small area - say, a patio - this might do, but there is no way to use this kind of product to protect a whole yard.
I've tried using assorted repellents like this for a while, always with mixed success. It's mixed enough for me to somewhat suspect more of a placebo effect--I want it to work so I think I notice more effect than it has.However, that being the case, there is enough of a indicator it has an influence in keeping away pests. But, I've found that if I try to use this as a complete solution, I'm both disappointed and quickly run out.  For me it works best with more of a targeted approach, using it where I particularly don't want pests to be or to go through--gaps in fences, openings between brush.  I have to be careful because I likewise don't want to use this where I or my family want to be.Mostly, I find it's helpful to keep our yard a relatively unfriendly place--so that we don't get overrun.  I've noticed a decrease in critter activity, so for that I keep using it.
I managed to trap 8 squirrels in 2011 with havahart animal cage (Havahart 0745 Live Animal Professional Style One-Door Chimpunk, Squirrel, Rat, and Weasel Trap). See my previous review of havahart animal cage. They were attracted to the bird feeder on my neighbor's backyard. It was a way to catch humanely. They have been "relocated" to a much bigger park where they can search more food and harass small birds. This year I have a difficulty catching the newcomer squirrels. They do not respond to the tasty peanuts that I put in the trap. I am not happy to find some spots here and there that have been dug by squirrels. So I pour this critter ridder around the garden and in the container. It works. The squirrels hate the powder so much that they do not touch my garden anymore.
I spread this around my lettuce boxes, which have been exhibiting little nibbles despite us living in an urban area (I see the bunny hopping around from time to time).  I made sure to apply on a dry night, when I knew there wouldn't be any rain for a day or two.  There were no new nibbles, but the smell was significantly diminished after a night or two.  It's worth noting that most of what I'd want to protect (herbs, veggies) needs a lot of water, making this "lasts 30 days" claim a bit dubious.  That being said, I think a mouthful must have deterred Peter Cottontail, who hasn't been back for seconds.  So, maybe even if I can't smell it, it's working (or maybe he has a memory of these things).  I'd purchase again if I saw more rabbits.
I'm always cynical about these sort of products... especially the more natural varieties, but this one does work. I don't know how long it will work, it's worked now for about 5 days. I used the whole container so I would have to buy another to refresh it, 5lbs seems like a lot, but I have a lot of area to cover.It smells good, almost good enough to eat! :) It helped cover the cat spray smell that we have in the front yard from strays. I was very happy about that part.  I used it in a circle around a favorite pooping spot and so far, 3 days later and a light rain, it's still effective.The only thing wrong is that I'll probably need a 25lb container of it to cover all the areas that have been used by the neighborhood cats. Other that, since it works, I like it!
The particular critters we want to get rid of are chipmunks - they're destroying our garden, tunneling into the lawn and even invading the house. The Havahart Critter Ridder is easy to use - just pop the cap and shake onto the ground.  I tried it around a peach tree the chipmunks had been fond of, and it did seem to reduce the number of attacks. I didn't expect miracles, given the number of chipmunks we have around, but it did seem to help for a while. As with all products of this nature, it needs to be periodically reapplied.
We have two types of nuisance pests - bunnies and voles. The bunnies eat up our garden and the voles eat up our lawn. I've tried all kinds of repellent, from commercial granules such as this to home-made recipes containing urine & castor oil. Although they may repeal for a time, our pests always return.This critter ridder was easy to apply, although I wish the shake canister top had a more finely calibrated way to shake out the ingredients. The ingredients appear to be relatively natural, and the dominant smell is of pepper - which didn't bother us while we applied or spent time in the yard application.It's been 2 weeks, and so far, so good. There has been no sign of bunnies, and there are no new vole trails. The product is expected to last 30 days, so that gives us just over 2 more weeks of protection and cover. Time will tell, but I would use this product again.
After trying this product, I agree with other reviews that it doesn't last 30 days.  The price point is high for what you get.  I prefer going to BJ's or Sam's Club and picking up a vat of black pepper and/or Cayenne powder and sprinkling it around any perimeter where you don't want critters and it is cheaper to use & I feel safer.  I've used the black pepper before around the perimeter of our home to deter black ants and it works.  We also use the black pepper & cayenne powder around our veggie garden to deter animals away.  We reapply as needed, but it seems once they know it's there, they find somewhere else to dine.  I've also used moth balls around my flower gardens to deter cats from eliminating in them.
Maybe my New Mexico critters are used to spicy food (this is the home of green chile after all) and the capsaicin and black pepper in this product just made them want to grab some chips and dig in.  I put this around 2 rose bushes that the rabbits and ground squirrels have been chewing on.The squirrels and rabbits happily snacked on my roses with this product applied liberally to the area around the rose bushes.  I watched them sitting on the product, eating my rose bushes.Perhaps they tested this on squirrels and rabbits who have no taste for chile.  Mine were yelling for me to throw out some tortilla chips.
This is a tough product to review.  I put it around the flowers in the pots at my pool.  I was having squirrels literally toss the flowers out, I assume looking for nuts from last year. Not being terribly squirrly myself I can't claim to know why the squirrels were yanking my flowers out but that is my guess.  I put this stuff around the flowers and have not had any issues since.  I am making a leap of faith that the granules are the reason why the squirrels have not returned.  They are still in the yard but have not bothered the plants. Since I am not sure that the product drove the squirrels away I can't give it 5 stars but since I am pretty sure, I will give it four stars.  BTW it does not have the strong odor I have found on similar types of products I have used in the past.
This is a great product for the short term. It will repel most mammals that are likely to take up residence under a structure or deck. I had a skunk under my backyard shed, and I spread this around the openings that it used, and the animal left. However, it's not practical to keep spreading this product indefinitely (though I do like its black-pepper odor). I ended up purchasing theSunforce Solar Pest Repeller two-pack(it is best to have at least two of these), which is now my long-term deterrent of choice. However, for a quick solution, Havahart Critter Ridder is hard to beat.
This stuff sure smells spicy - black and hot pepper spicy.  It comes in a nice shaker and is considered organic.The issue seems to be that it has a limited effectiveness.  I shook it around our garden and under the birdfeeder where the squirrels and chipmunks congregate, but they either got used to it right away or I didn't use enough.  That's the other thing - for the price this seems to be a small amount and did not go very far.  The container is quite a bit less than I was expecting - 5 lbs is not much at all.  They indicate this is enough to cover 300 square feet but it's pretty hard to shake it out that finely or evenly so your'e really only covering perhaps 100 square feet.
Two of the features that are the most noteworthy are the handle and  the foot space on the top of the blade. The handle makes it much easier to use than a straight handle. The extra width for the foot is a real benefit for comfort and for being able to exert more digging force. This is a very fine shovel.I removed one star because of a flaw in the finish on the pole portion. It does not affect the usage of the shovel but it certainly affects the appearance. But, more importantly, by having a bare spot on the steel it is more subject to rust than the other portions that have a finish on them. I guess the days of quality control are long gone.
I have another shovel purchased at our local big box store but this has become to the go-to shovel for both myself 5'3" and my husband 6'2".  It has a great pointed end that digs well into grass and dirt (I am in the process of getting rid of a lot of sod and turning it into flower beds).  We have also used this to dig out old tree roots from trees that were removed last year.  The oversize-step works well for people of different heights.
I ordered this Fiskars Big Grip Garden Knife to add to the bucket of go to garden tools.  It is a strong tool which combines knife, saw, weeder and spade into one tool.  The heavy galvanized coating and heavy rubber tool handle with a cord strap to hang, is as good as I have.  I refuse to buy expensive garden tools, as almost any tool can be used to do most work.  Even a claw hammer as needed to dig out a hole.  This tool is probably the best of all worlds.  It should last the life of your desire to do gardening.  I love it.
This is a fine tool for very light use. Unfortunately, most of the tasks you use a garden knife for are anything but light duty. After losing my many-years old hori hori knife, I thought I'd try this, mainly due to the price. On the plus side, the grip is comfortable, and the notched point is a nice feature. However, the build quality is not at all suitable to the things I want to use a garden knife for, such as prying out major weeds, dislodging rocks, sawing small roots, and dividing dense perennial clumps, etc. The blade is very thin and it is not securely attached to the handle. Returned it and went for a more sturdy knife (AM Leonard brand) that works much better (albeit at a higher cost). This knife would be fine for very light use in light soil. It won't survive anything else.
The Fiskars knife has actually lasted for 2 years of use with my professional gardening company, and due to the big black handle and orange detailing, has never gotten lost in the weeds like the wood-grain hori-hori, a similar tool, has. It doesn't appear to be made of long-lasting materials at first glance, but we've put it through the paces with 20 hours a week of weeding and it has stood the test of time.I would prefer an option without the dandelion fork attached since the forked tip can make it harder to plant and dig other things with it. Otherwise, I find the serration and sharp blade handy in the garden and appreciate the ergonomic handle that is easy to grip.If you're used to using a trowel you'll find this soil knife a huge upgrade. The straight blade make it easy to plunge into the soil for fast bulb planting, annual planting, and weed removal.
I bought 3 of these after seeing a hori hori knife belonging to a friend of mine. The design is exactly the same, and 2 of the knives have survived for 2 years. The first knife snapped after only a few weeks of use (but an employee was using it, so you never know exactly what was going on....).The knife seems to work great and at a fraction of the price of a genuine hori hori knife. After 2 years of using it myself I'm pretty sure that it won't snap off if you don't treat it like a shovel when you are using it. I give it 4 out of 5 stars for the one knife which broke a few weeks after purchase.
I like these Fiskar shovels.  This one is really handy for transplanting as you would imagine.  Good for digging any type of deep narrow holes or edging a lawn.  Seems sturdy and good steel.  The handle is a bit plasticky and I hope that it holds up.  I also have the Fiskars 9668 shovel which has all steel handle to the end - no plastic.  That shovel seems a little stouter than this one but is also heavier and for different uses.  This is a winner.  I want more Fiskar shovels.
This is the Chinese Fiskars product line. All their shovels are made there, and I have repeated problems with their D Handle shovels. The blade is not aligned properly with the handle. The handle is cocked at an angle so that it twists the wrist when using it. I have returned several shovels to Amazon, and now I give up. And, yes, it is not pre-sharpened. And, no, it came with no PVC sleeve. If Fiskars wants to cheapen their image with this poor quality, I will be thinking three times before I buy Fiskars in the future.
This shovel upholds the great experiences I have had with other Fiskars hand tools. Its metal construction gives me the confidence to lean on it when trying to get a bush out of the ground, and pushing it through clay soil is no problem. I've never had a transplanting shovel before, and now I wouldn't do without one!There are cheaper tools on store shelves, but after using this several times, I would not hesitate to replace it with another one. I don't think I ever will need to, however, as this shovel is so well-made that I can't imagine wearing it out or damaging it.I liked this shovel (and another Fiskars shovel that I bought) that I gave this one to my brother as a gift. This gets a rare 5-star review from me!
I have a number of pruners including a Felco and a Fisker power gear pruner. Both are fine pruners, but the powergear really is intended to be used by a righty. Which my wife is.I am a lefty and short of buying the Felco lefty pruner I thought I would give this a shot. I am glad I did. First the handles are very comfortable. Excellent shape to them. The most comfortable handles I have ever used on a pruner. Second it is very maunervable. You can get to branches from any angle and direction. And I do want to point out that is really hand-neutral. My wife likes it just as much as I do. Of much less importance it looks cool. All black.But bottom-line is you get an excellent performing pruner with extremely comfortable handles at a very good price. Great choic for a lefty or righty.
I did a bunch of pruning with ease using these fine shears. However, when I tried to lock them shut I could not get the lock arm to return to its initial position to lock the shears closed. I decided to check the reviews again more thoroughly to see if others had the same problem. A reviewer suggested loosening the Phillips screw holding the lock arm. I followed that advice and the result removed the slight negative feeling I had toward these shears and now all is well. These may well be the best shears I have ever owned.
I do a lot of work on my 2.5 acres of southern Florida yard. Everything grows fast, even in the dry season. I use saws, machetes, cutters, trimmers,and pruners depending on the task.  Pruning is a big thing for me since I had rotator cuff surgery on my dominant shoulder and swinging a machete or using heavier equipment is harder than it used to be.So I do a lot of pruning and depend on my chosen tool to be sharp, work properly consistently, and have a functional safety mechanism if provided. Unfortunately I can't keep this blade sharp, it seems to crush what I'm cutting instead of sharply severing it, and the locking mechanism continually engages when I don't want it to. Big disappointment.  Perhaps it's time for Amazon and other retailers to indicate on their descriptions where each product is manufactured.
I purchased this on Gold Box deal and it was defective... the latch that keeps it closed would not engage after a really tough time opening it. I mentioned the GB deal because when Amazon shipped me a new pair the price had dropped by a buck and had I checked before asking for a replacement I'd just done a return and made a new purchase for the savings... because that's how cheap I am! As usual, Amazon made the return simple and shipped a replacement right away. My wife has a very small hand and this pair is a great fit for her because of the angled handles. I gave it 4 stars because the first one was defective but otherwise I'd be going with 5.
I got this tiny tool under the theory that it would feel like an extension of my arm. I was not disappointed. Last weekend, I used it to strip and chop up some oak branches for kindling. Sharp as heck, light, but powerful enough to quickly chop through the branches.  Feels good to use.  Would be a great one to take along on outdoor trips, but you would want to get a different cover in that case.  The plastic snap in is more suited for hanging in the garage than for travel.One reviewer said it's dangerous. It certainly could be if you're not careful. But I mean, it's a frickin hatchet.  What do you expect?
Fiskars 8-Inch Hatchet is very dangerous.  You can cut off a limb or a protrusion from a hand if you don't know how to use this.  The level of training it takes to competently instate yourself with the knowledge of "Hatchet chopping" is about 2 years.Most people pick this up for recreational use at the local fish pond or RV camp and meet disastrous results, which result in the trip to the local hospital ward.  I can not endorse a Hatchet that is so flauntingly dangerous.  If you need wood, you can buy it somewhere or hire a vagrant to cut it from a forest.I implore you, Do not use this!UPDATE:  I've documented numerous cases where the user of the Hatchet has produced a variety of injuries, ranging from simple cuts to the loss of a limb.
You will not be disappointed with any Fiskars product, and no, I do not work for the company. Wish I did. All the Fiskars axes and hatchets are wonderful. I went a little crazy a few months ago and ordered about one of every size axe/hatchet that Fiskars make and I love each one equally. The handle, the look, the design, the price. This is a top of the line product. Anything else other than a a Fiskars is a waste of your time and money. Ohhh, Just had a thought....I did buy the Fiskars sharpening tool as well. The Fiskars sharpening tool is a piece of junk. It broke when I tried to use it the first time and I was completely unimpressed, but I did not return it to the vendor, too much hassle. The axes/hatchets are GREAT though and you will love them.
This rake is the perfect tool to use in my raised garden bed. It is small enough to get between the plants but wide enough to get the job done. The aluminum handle and the plastic tines make for a lightweight tool that is easy to handle. The rake is held in place on the handle with just a single screw which makes it easy to replace should that become necessary. This is a nice companion to its cousin, the Fiskars garden rake which I use mostly to rake magnolia leaves. This shrub rake also does a good job of raking the leaves between the shrubs that surround my house.This shrub rake is reasonably priced and a very handy addition to my Fiskars collection. It is a worthwhile purchase.
Although we have a rather small lot, probably 1/5 of an acre, we have a tremendous number of maple trees, tulip trees, etc, all those that lose their leaves for the winter.  We also have a lot of shrubs and arbor vitae on the ground around the yard.  It's always been tough getting those leaves out from around these areas.  These rakes really fit the bit and it's much easier getting around those areas now.  In fact, with the other rakes, I just said "forget it".  With these, the yards look much cleaner because I can get those leaves out.  In fact, I ordered 2 of these... one for the garage in the back (back yard) and one for the garage alongside the house (side yard and front yard).
Like its big brother, this is an excellent quality rake. The 8" shrub rake is durable and has a comfortable handle.Great for getting into tight spots around your landscaping.The head and tines are flexible and durable.I have had this rake for a few years and it is still in mint condition even after a lot of use. I have had small shrub rakes that have too stiff a tine and end up with broken tines.These are flexible and strong.A very nice item.Highly recommended.
I bought this along with the 24" Fiskar rake and carry both of them where I go in the garden.  Like the 24" rake, the design is very light with an oblong handle designed for better grip and orientation.  The tines are very flexible and are useful at a wide range of angles unlike most rakes.Although this is called a shrub rake, it's useful for a variety of garden projects, such as raking the edge of borders, sculpting the mulch around plants, or sweeping fine garden debris from the lawn into a dust pan.The only drawback with the Fiskar rake is its flexibility which means it can't be used to scrape the ground or move light soil around like I am able to do with my stiffer shrub rakes.  However this makes it ideal for gently combing your plants.Overall, I believe every fastidious gardener could use this product.
Not only did the one I got from Walmart look identical (except for label Kelsyus), and cost 1/3 of the price, it is also holding up better.I bought the two at the same time and Kelsyus one won't hold air in the pillow.I've returned this one for a replacement and will give the company a second chance. Kelsyus has a good reputation but the two products I have bought from them have not held up.Update after a year:  I have now purchased a dozen different designs of floats and this design remains the most popular for use with young children because it's the easiest to climb onto, particularly with waterwings (life jacket).  My husband also prefers this design because more of your body is in the water.
This was really easy to inflate, but nothing is as easy as floating around in the pool on a hot summer day and keeping cool.I bought this a couple of weeks ago because I wanted an extra float for the pool. With the recent heat wave it has been getting a work out not only in the pool but in the gulf as well. It submerges every so slightly but is cooling enough to offer real comfort from the extreme heat. It is compact when deflated and easy to take to the beach as well. The construction is decent given its extremely reasonable price. In this weather however, it is priceless. I just went to the pool store today and picked up another water hammock for the weekend when the family comes down.
I bought this last year to use with my new pool. So in about six months of using it, here are my initial thoughts:PROS- Very comfortable- Lets water come up through the float so you actually feel like your IN the pool, not ON the pool (my pool temp is usually 82-85 so this is favorable)- Easy to pack up to carry or store- Colors have not faded even with salt water and sunCONS- Could be challenging to get in if you're, uhm, voluptuous- You can't lay on your stomach, only on your backOVERALLThis is an excellent float to have for a pool. My kids keep me busy in and around the pool so I don't get to use it much but when I'm alone, this is the first thing I grab.
I've tried the sonic spikes, I've tried traps (which works somewhat, but kind of a pain), and I have used poison pellets.These seem to work well, but as mentioned elsewhere here (same for kill traps for that matter), you MUST find and use these on the main tunnel, or you might as well be throwing them away.  I think this is the most difficult part in controlling moles, because the main tunnel is not always obvious.I was able to find the long, straight run that my critters were using, inserted the worms, and after about a week, I noticed much less activity.  Will continue to use these throughout the summer if they continue to be so effective.Highly recommended.
The Tomcat mole killer worms are a really neat idea. We've had various mole eliminating or repelling products. I like the concept of the worm baits. The mole traps that actually stab the moles are just little violent and gory for my liking. The repellents just aren't effective enough. The worms are a toxic bait just like when you bait mice. The good and the bad thing is that you don't have to get involved in the aftermath. I say good because I don't want to dispose of dead mole bodies and I say bad because you won't always know if you are getting them. You may find a body or two but mostly just that the little mole runways all through your yard aren't being occupied any longer.
I&#8217;ve got critter problems this year and moles tend to be a constant. And as a result I&#8217;m trying a few different things. My usual castor oil concoction is nothing like this and so I found myself checking out the ingredients. The main ingredient is bromethalin, a far cry from my inoffensive castor oil. I do want to drive them off the property, but what I don&#8217;t want is for other animals to ingest it.We do have other animals who trespass and I&#8217;m using other &#8220;stay away,&#8221; but natural methods. What I don&#8217;t want is for other animals to dig for this in hopes of a nice snack. Not that I like the presence of red squirrels or chipmunks when they invade my home or outbuildings, but don&#8217;t want to use this very toxic poison. Think I&#8217;ll take a pass on this one.
I honestly don't know if this bait works. So perhaps I should not even be writing a review, but at least I'm being honest. I find a few tunnel holes in the backyard but have never seen moles, so I may not even have any. We do have small roof mice here in Arizona. They tend to feed on the backyard oranges & grapefruit that have fallen to the ground. But, since placing this bait out I have seen no dead ones, so I really don't know if this bait is working, at least on them.
All I can say is that the 5 people that reviewed this product MUST work for "Tomcat" cause these little "worms" are as much of a joke as every other mole bait out there.  I have used 5 boxes of these (yes, literally 5 boxes) and I have had NO success whatsoever.  Granted, I must be a fool for spending over $100 on one product, but I have tried everything else and was desperate.  Don't waste your money.  Not sure what else to tell you to try though, outside of making sure that your yard doesn't have grubworms.
I really didn't know what to expect with these, I know I had moles in my yard last year so I tried these. They are a bit strange. They remind me a lot of fishing lures. The concept is you bury them and the moles tunnel in and find them. In concept they are good, they are toxic. What I found is in the one area I put them to test them out I found my dog was doing a lot of sniffing around. I had to constantly keep her away from the area because I was afraid she would try to dig them up and eat them.I can't confirm if they work or not, but it is an interesting concept, easy to deploy. Just make sure you don't have kids or pets that may be curious and try to get to them.
Works just the way it is advertised.  Bait the tunnels and moles will die.  What more could you ask for?As a rural country dweller, moles were a constant thing.  Using these and a few other Tomcat products, my yard is no longer covered in mole tunnels.  I will be buying this product again.One caution though, might not be a good idea to use these if you have outside pets that may either dig them up and eat them or eat the dead mole once it has surfaced.  May truly harm your dog or cat.
According to the package, this is a slow working poison and would leave moles suffering for two days before they died.  (I might be willing to let a nasty rat suffer that long, if necessary and found no alternative, I will admit.)  But, it seems a cruel and inhumane for a cute little mole.  And we only have a mild issue with them.  We will seek another solution.Perhaps you have a mole issue rampant enough to justify that, and if so, I'll not certainly not judge you.  Just, well,&#34; there's the facts&#34; on this one.  I'm not willing to torture the little guys.
I think this is just too hard to say if it works or not. New moles come and take a prior one's territory so quickly and unless you see them dead, you just don't know...and you won't see them dead using these. I have dug up the tunnel over and over to see if it is still there and haven't seen it taken. So, I have switched to Cinch traps and they work for me because I have so many rock walls and landscaping that can only fit those kind.
This package contains six baits per pack and they are shaped like earthworms. The bait is made of mole-poison Bromethalin. I tried to use this to kill moles in my yard where there is significant traffic in the soil. The trickiest part is the proper application. I use a hard wooden stick or a metal rod to pierce a hole in the mound and detect the tunnel, and then drop a teaspoon full of poison pellets, when I am using Bromethalin pellets. Generally the holes are below the surface and the stick gives a reasonable measure of where the tunnel is. There are hits and misses, but you have to place this where moles can find it. I found it very challenging to put this into mole tunnels (the product is very wiggly) and finally gave up. I recommend Bromethalin pellets which are easier to handle and apply.
cut the worms in pieces, crushed the runs and waited for repair, baited each hole.  Waited days and checked, worm gone in some, but no dead moles, and burrows continue to appear.  I have tried traps, poison peanuts, more traps, more traps, more traps.  These moles seem to live close to the house foundations and burrow into the grass sod to eat worms each year.  One came up and died on it's own last fall perhaps from &#34;old age&#34;.  Nothing seems to kill these critters, as long as we have earthworms and sandy soil and shade.
I hate to be responsible for killing any sort of animal, but the moles in our yard have become too much. The burrows and tunnels create a danger for my 89 year old mother to walk around the yard, she has fallen when her  foot went down into a tunnel and turned her ankle.The burrows go right up to some of the plants I have had for several years and enjoyed. Evidently the moles did too because they were gnawed at under the surface. It is possible that these were also voles; but the bottom line is that I wanted them gone. This product accomplished that and was much more efficient than repellants that let them come back.
I planted about 7 of these in various trails in the yard.  The activity in the grass seems to have stopped, but I think I'm still getting activity in the vegetable garden, which borders the back of our yard.  The tricky thing about this is that you have to find an active tunnel, then carefully place the worm in the trail, trying not to disturb the tunnel too much.  That's tricky.  The other downside is that since the little buggers go die somewhere buried in the yard, there's no proof that they did the deed. That said, I recommend these as part of a multi-pronged anti-mole arsenal..
In the year 2014 the most reliable way to kill rats is still the old-fashioned trap with food (peanut butter works really well).This trap is supposed to snap the rat and thus kill it. This is a theoretical situation. I would caution you to watch your fingers and set it very carefully. also, sometimes, rats do not die in the trap, and are pinned against in it instead. Be very careful when handling the trap with the rat in it. Traps in general are hit or miss and this one is no exception.Also, beware that using peanut butter or cheese will attract pets. Place the trap in a place where the pet can't get to it.Warn children not to go anywhere near it as well -- you don't want the child getting his or her fingers snapped off or handling a dead rat, or worse, getting bitten by a trapped rat.
We have either a roof rat or some sort of squirrel or chipmunk in our attic.  There are small piles of spindle-shaped poop scattered all over part of the attic.We set a few different traps to see which one would work as rats are notoriously cautious about changes in their surroundings.  Right now the Tomcat Wooden Rat Trap is baited with peanut butter and birdseed. Our Victor Wood trap is baited with peanut butter and bacon grease.  Plus we have a Victor battery powered zap trap set just in case.So far we haven't caught anything and the poop is still fresh and shiny.  I will report back when we do (or fail to) catch anything.
Don't set out a mouse size trap if you have a rat size rat. We had the opportunity to find that out when we knew that we had a big rodent when our mouse traps were being sprung but not catching anything. The mouse was just too big to be caught in a small trap. We've used baits in the past but don't like them because we don't want a mouse or rat going off and dying in the wall. The downside of a trap is definitely having to fool with the thing. I don't like having to set them, bait them or dispose of the trapped animal. I really don't like having to set a rat size trap. It makes me nervous, that thing is big enough to break a finger if you're not careful. I actually set it without any trouble. We did not have any trouble with it whatsoever. It worked flawlessly. Worked well for what it is.
The reason people have used this kind of trap for a hundred years is that it works.The TomCat Wooden Rat trap is a breeze to set but PAY ATTENTION. This trap is powerful enough to cause your fingers real harm. I have not had any false triggers off this trap. It has killed quickly and cleanly. None of the little critters have still been alive and biting when I got to the trap. Anyone who has had that experience will appreciate that.Make sure you set this where you know only unwanted critters will get to it.
Obviously, this is something you want to keep out of the reach of children and pets (not to mention quite a few adults). While mouse traps can hurt if they snap on you, this thing would crush bones.It's easy to bait and set, has a metal pedal (which is fine), and works.My only suggestion? Since all rat traps are pretty much the same, and you're paying quite a bit for the convenience of shipping here, if you have access to one locally (a hardware store, etc), it would probably be significantly cheaper.
I had the chance to try this trap out and I'll first start by saying it is very easy to set. The metal bar that snaps down simply pulls back with a bit of force, and a little bar locks it into place. The trap was very easy to set, I was able to set it exactly where I wanted it and it did not go off without something hitting the bait plate. Now I haven't had it kill a rat yet, but in playing with it I was able to barely tap the bait plate and the trap snapped and left a mark on the wood dowel rod I used to trigger the trap. It seems like it has a lot of force.If you need a rat trap this one seems to be a good option in terms of ease to set it and reliability. As for stopping power as I haven't caught a rat yet you would need to find another persons review for that.
Make no mistake, this will kill mid sized rodents right quick. And they'll even snap a few fingers if you're not careful while setting them. The spring is very strong. This old school style trap is still the best solution by far. Yup, you're gonna see the dead rodent laying there, staring at you with that blank, lifeless look in it's eyes. But it gets the job done. Just be careful not to put it anywhere pets or kids can trip it by accident. A trap this strong will definitely hurt if tripped accidentally. I find peanut butter works best.
In all honesty, I think this trap would kill any small rodent (squirells, chipmunks, small rabbits) as well as rats, so be cautious where you place this.  We have it in out well pump house - where we also store animal feed.  So far, it's taken out one - using the Tomcat Mouse Attractant gel as bait.  Super heavy duty trap, I would suggest wearing gloves to spring load the trap after placing the bait on the tray.  Might save some nasty bruising to your fingers if the trap slips what setting.
THIS IS A GIANT TRAP! I never knew that mouse traps could be so well made. If you think of your regular size mousetrap and multiply times 5 you get this well made TOMCAT RAT TRAP. This could catch a large cat because of its size and weight. The steel is twice as thick as a wire coat hanger or more. The wood is large and heavy. Only get this trap for a huge rat...not small mice. Be careful when setting it because it can easily break your fingers. It is quality made and is huge.
I live near a river and some woods as a result mice and other wildlife are abundant. Mice will often make it to my outdoor shed, my garage and my basement.  My shed has also been home to larger rodents.I placed this in my shed to see if I had rats and happily I have not caught one. It is good to have around just in case.It is easy enough to set but I would be careful. If this came down on your finger it would hurt. This also needs to be kept away from children for that reason and pets as well. If it did catch a Rat I think the Rat would die.
First of all, this is a sturdy built rat trap. The wooden base is thick and flat, and the hardware is firmly embedded into the base. The trap is easy to bait, and fairly easy to set once you get the hang of it. It does seem harder to make this trap trip than another well-known name brand rat trap, but if you use a sticky bait like peanut butter it will guarantee success much more readily than something like a bread-ball.Where the mixed results come in, is the spring tension. It feels as if it has plenty of tension, and it is enough to kill smaller to medium sized rats, but larger rats might not be instantly killed. There was one larger rat trapped across the neck that was still gasping for air when I found it out in the barn, and it had managed to drag the trap several feet away from where it had been originally set. With that in mind, if you have big rats, go for a bigger trap.
In the year 2014 the most reliable way to kill mice is still the old-fashioned trap with food (peanut butter works really well).This product is four traps. One trap is supposed to snap the mouse and thus kill it, and then you go and dispose of it in your trash (hopefully, while wearing gloves!).I would caution you to watch your fingers and set the traps very carefully. Also, sometimes, mice do not die in the trap, and are pinned against in it instead. Be very careful when handling the trap with the mouse in it. Traps in general are a hit or miss and this one is no exception.Also, beware that using peanut butter or cheese will attract pets. Place the trap in a place where the pet can't get to it.Warn children not to go anywhere near it as well -- you don't want the child getting his or her fingers snapped off or handling a dead mouse, or worse, getting bitten by a trapped mouse.
The ever faithful wooden snap traps are my least favourite method of attracting and getting rid of mice.  These are only used as a last resort as I hate having to dispose of the catch.  I would much rather mice not make it into my home at all; therefore I put1 Pack Dispos Bait Station, Mouse Bait Station 16ref, and pellets underneath my home and in sheds and any place on my property that mice like to make a habitat of.These are by far the easiest wooden traps I've used.  When I bait and set these traps they remain set even when I place them on the floor or underneath the cabinets, they don't snap and scare the bejeepers out of me when I least expect it.  The plastic "slice" of cheese is a cute addition and has a designated place for theOZ Mouse Attractant Gel.I haven't caught anything yet and I hope that's a good thing and means that my efforts to keep them out are working.
We get mice every winter. We've tried plugging holes, sticking around peppermint and mothballs, and we have mice. We bought these traps, put peanut butter on them. The mice ate the peanut butter, the traps did not spring. They are total junk and we went back to Victor. There was a reason these were the only ones left on the store shelf when went to buy them.Jim said the problem is when it's set the platform is high and it seems that a mouse would have problems setting it off, the trigger is not sensitive.
We don't get mice in or house often but when we do, these mousetraps really work at getting rid of them.I didn't know until I read on another review that you could set these for FIRM or SENSITIVE release. That's good to know. I tend to bait the trap a couple of times before actually getting the little critters. They are able to steal the peanut butter from the traps without springing them. But I think now I was setting them on FIRM release. Also I think I was putting too much peanut butter on the trap.But I was always able to get the nasty little rodents using these traps.And they are cheap enough that I don't feel bad about throwing trap and mouse carcass away and not re-using the traps. That has a big yuck factor to me.I would have rated this trap five stars if there had been better instructions on the package.
These traps are of the common design as the classic Victor models.  There is an adjustment for sensitivity.  To catch any mice, use a minimum amount of bait on the trigger spot &#8211; I have found peanut butter or smooshed soft cheese to work.  I have not caught any mice yet on these traps since the mice are now living outside the house / garage.  They make their way inside when it starts to get cold in the fall and winter.  The traps do seem to be of average quality with a hard snap.  My tests at triggering the trap showed them to perform similarly to other mouse traps I own.
We have tried a lot of different mouse traps over the years including the electric kind. I prefer these as they are cheap enough to throw away when let's say a mouse decomposes on it because we didn't check a shed for a month. I like I can see if I caught a mouse from a distance without touching the trap. I like they kill quickly most of the time, I don't want rodents but I don't want to be cruel either.  We recently used the gel bait which worked great, caught a mouse on the gel sitting next to a trap with peanut butter on it. We always get mice in from the cornfield across the street in the fall, prefer to kill them before they breed more.
These are your basic wooden mouse traps and they work very well.  One was kind of hard to set but the others were no problem. I just set them normally and used peanut butter on them like my other traps.  I just spread some on the bottom of the little piece of plastic cheese that is the activator button.  It makes it a little harder for the mice to just take the bait and get away.  The worked great and caught a mouse already.  Will use again.  Just keep out of where kids are as they might set the traps off easily and get their fingers smashed.
They're just like every other wooden mouse trap you've ever seen or set (except maybe the kind with a metal pedal). Several brands distribute these traps, and they work just fine. I tend to prefer mechanical traps over poisons, since there's less chance of something or someone accidentally getting poisoned. The risk then becomes keeping them out of the reach of pets and kids, but I don't find this too difficult.I have caught mice with these traps.One thing to mention: if you look at hardware stores locally, you'll probably find an identical trap much more inexpensively (the last ones I purchased locally were on sale: two traps for a buck). Shipping them from an internet vendor necessarily increases the cost of these lightweight items.
These are pretty standard mouse traps. They set up just like any of the traditional traps where you put bait on a platform (in this case, the yellow piece which resembles cheese) pull back the u-shaped bar, use a cross piece to set it. I tested these with a pencil to see how sensitive the trap was and it seemed to trigger just fine, though it did take a little more jostling than I think a typical mouse might make.I didn't actually order these to catch mice though; my purpose was a pinterest project wherein you remove the piece where you place the bait as well as the cross bar that sets the trap. The remaining piece then becomes something like a giant clip. You paint the wooden base and use it as a clip where you can hang papers. I will be using these in my classroom, and for my project, they filled my needs perfectly.
These traps aren't popular with the squeamish, however, sometimes tried and true is the best choice. We've all seen traps like this before, so not much needs to be elaborated; they haven't changed much in 50 years at least. Just put a little peanut butter on the yellow part, pull back the spring arm, carefully latch it, and then pull your fingers away gingerly, lest it go snap, and you go ouch! With all the newfangled traps out there, these always catch way more than any of them. If you got a mouse problem, this kind of trap will do the best job. Cheap too. Use it once and toss it.
The basic design of the mousetrap has not changed in over 100 years, but there have been some minor improvements. They are less likely to catch your finger instead of the mouse. One thing I especially like about these is the trigger, it is larger than most. So the mouse is more likely to set off the trap. The plastic actually smells like cheese, so you can put it out without bait ans still catch a mouse. Personally, I use peanut butter with a touch of bird seed to bait my traps. And from past use of Tomcat mousetraps, I can tell you they still work when you go months between mice and have fewer to none false alarms of the trap just failing.
Living on a farm, I've tried a lot of different mouse traps.  And quite frankly, the classic wooden mouse trap is the most humane, quick way to handle mice.  They are a bit intimidating setting them and worrying about snapping your fingers; but if you can ignore the fact that you have a steel trap about to snap your fingers off while you are setting it... then I definitely recommend them!The &#34;cheese&#34; part attracts mice on it's own but it works much, much better if you put a little dab of peanut butter near the little &#34;square&#34; on the cheese base.If you haven't used a wooden trap, definitely try it out because you won't catch nearly as many mice with any other type of trap!
I have used these for years and never caught a mouse with one, particularly when using the Tomcat attractant.  What they do well for me is scare our cats.  We remove one of the 2 springs to avoid injury to our little friends, then place them all over the kitchen counters and stove in the evening to teach the younger cats that those are scary places.  It rarely takes more than 2 incidents to drive the lesson home.  Find a better use for a mousetrap and the world will........
I already have the Motomco 22310 Tomcat Tier 1 Disposable Bait Station which I use in my house but these are very useful for areas like your garage or outbuilding where you want a simple trap and where kids are going to tamper with them.  You just put something like peanut butter on them and set it to F for firm and wait.I didn't catch anything in my garage and no sign of anything getting the bait but bingo and I caught 2 in an outbuilding so far so these certainly work and are simple to use.  Only problem I have noticed a few times bait disappearing and no catch so maybe not the best traps but still effective enough overall and I would recommend especially for the price on Amazon.
I am very impressed with these mouse traps when compared to another well known brand. These traps are very easy to bait and to make the bait stay in place. The traps have two trigger settings, if you look closely at the yellow plastic near where you set the little bar, you'll see an F on the left side and an S on the right. Those stand for Firm or Sensitive release, and depending on which side you choose for setting the trap, you'll either have it trip with very light pressure or with moderate pressure.When these traps snap, the mouse is dead. They snap with enough force to break the neck and kill the mouse instantly. The wide bait platform ensures that the mouse will more times than not, trip the trap when trying to get the bait.
This trap is dangerous....and not only for mice!It's a slightly better design than the all wood and wire cheapies that spring either when you look at them, or not at all.It's easy to smear peanut butter on the plastic 'cheese' holes, but be careful setting the trap. Right now my middle finger has a blood blister from getting caught as it snapped while getting the stabilizing bar in the right position.I'm not complaining too much, however, as it shows that it snaps with enough force to kill quick and clean. Probably more humane than poison.
I love how pretty these bulbs are, but they are also quite useful.  I have four of them, two for indoor plants and two for outdoor plants that are in an awkward, hard to water spot in my garden.  They seem to keep the plants adequately watered, sometimes for up to two weeks depending on weather conditions.  My one complaint is that it is really hard for me to trickle water in to fill them up.  If the hose is on too heavy water just splashes and doesn't fill the bulb.  I've also tried dunking them in a bucket of water to fill, but this is slow to fill also, I think just due to the narrow aperture of the stem.  Overall I'm very happy with these and intend to get more.
This is a great buy for a 2 pack.  The globes are gorgeous and they have that imperfect shapes that show that they are hand made.  These are pretty simple and the physics are even simpler.  You add water to the globe stick the spout in the water and as the dirt (after soaking it) and as the dirt dries it sucks the water in from the globe and keeps the soil moist.  They seem to work pretty good and if you water the area with a sprinkler the globes go even further.  When i put it in the soil did get in the pipe, but since it is soil it will pull the water and still work.  I have not had any issue and these are a gorgeous addition to my flower pots.I will note that you need to put the spout away from the edge of the pot or the water will run out quickly, I find around 1.5 to 2 inches in seems to work pretty good!
We've been lucky with the herbs, so far. They grow well and we grow enough of them to have all the herbs we want, when we need them. We find it difficult to grow tomatoes and impossible to grow them in any significant quantities. Everything else is in-between. We never tried flowers but we might this coming summer because we have a real outdoors garden that produces everything we need during the summer months.So, go with the herbs, young or post-young woman or man :)The basils are fantastic and we got good oregano and arugula too.
We've had an Aerogarden for two years now and love it.  This is the first time we have gotten the Japanese Herb Kit and it has some problems:  the Red Shiso, Green Shiso and Nira Chives did not germinate at all.  We e-mailed Aerogrow customer service department and they are sending us a new Japanese Herb Kit free of charge.  We've used the herbs that did germinate:  Chrysanthemum, Mitsuba and Cress in salads and on sandwiches.  The flavors of these herbs is interesting, but we are really looking forward to using the Red and Green Shiso, which are more widely used in Japanese food.
I bought my Aerogrow garden last February (2007) and have had three long lasting crops since then:  Italian herbs, French herbs and International Basil.  The whole family has enjoyed the process and it has been great to be able to just snip herbs when neeeded.  I've had one major problem -- my pump stopped working after I put in my latest crop (Salsa Garden).  I called Aerogrow Customer Service and they took me through the steps to try to correct the problem and when none of them worked, they sent me a brand new pump free of charge and a replacement Salsa Garden Kit free of charge. MARCH 1, 20009 -- My Aerogarden is still one of my favorite purchases and the Customer Service is still wonderful.  A couple of seed pods from my latest kit did not germinate; one call to Aerogrow and they are sending me a brand new kit, free of charge.
Nice dispenser. It will hold up to four 3" chlorine tablets. I did come across one problem though. Letting it float free throughout the pool allowed it to get stuck in the opening of the skimmer. This caused a decrease of water getting to the pump. Now this would eventually cause your pump to overheat. So I have to keep it teathered to the ladder and let it float free when the pump is off. I seem to have done better just putting a couple tablets directly in the skimmer. But all in all it does what it suppose to.
I purchased one of these plastic rain birds about a year ago and was very pleased. It does actually work better than the brass rain birds. So now I wanted to order some more and was pleased to see the price had dropped by a couple of bucks. So I ordered 4 more but low and behold these are not the same and of course not as good. My well is set at 70 pds. and with a 3/4 pipe and one sprinkler attached I can only get 28 ft. coverage max and there are dry spots that it does not cover. All four are the same. Shame on rain bird, they are ruining there reputation. I would gladly have paid the extra couple of bucks to get the same as I had before. They seem to have the same model number as the old one too.
This is my all time favorite sprinkler, its pretty amazing. Don't waste your money on others and don't waster your water using others.Pros: NO overspray after setting your pattern! It seems like all the brass ones sprinkle water farther than the set pattern and that can be a waste of water. This is a sharp shooter and moves very fast because of the lightweight plastic parts. It shoots farther than other comparable sprinkler heads. It is easy to install. It is easy to adjust the spray range. Low cost. It has three ways to adjust the spray pattern (variety of nozzles, screw that touches the stream of water, and the top of the head raises and lowers).Cons: None.Other: I have tried multiple brass/zinc sprinklers and all of them seem to spray water farther than the set pattern, which is a waste of water. I have noticed the plastic rain bird sprinklers are very sharp in keeping the water within the pattern and they have absolutely no leakage on the head. Most sprikn
This is a very inexpensive sprinkler head. The Rain Bird works well in the short radius range. It gets everything covered out about 24 feet with reasonable even water coverage. If it is adjusted to a larger radius, it tends to put most of the water out near the outer perimeter and close to the sprinkler. Not very much water falls in the middle area. Since I wasn't really looking to pay much and don't need a very wide coverage it works for me. If you need a large area covered evenly, I suggest a better sprinkler.
I needed to connect a timer to a drip irrigation system and a hose connected to a sprinkler to the same spigot.  Gilmour Brass 2 Way connector does a perfect job without any leaks.I needed to use Vise Grips to loosen the valves for the first time, but after that they operated easily and smoothly.  The splitter was easy to install. I used plumber's teflon tape connecting the splitter to the spigot and to hose on one connector and timer on the other. The valves operate smoothly and do not require a lot of strength to open/close, and none of the junctions leak.The Gilmour Brass 2-way connector stock photo makes it looks a bit larger than it is in real life.  I am attaching a photo of the connector after it was installed so you can see it in context.Photo posted: installed Gilmour connector.
You wouldn't think that a 2-way splitter would be a difficult purchase but there are splitters and then there are splitters. This item is easily five-star out of the box. First, I was able to connect it to an outside faucet that was right up against the wall of the house. The black top allowed me to tighten the connector sufficiently tightly to eliminate leakage. Note that the whole unit does not have to turn, just the top connector. Secondly, the two on-off valves turned easily and tightly sealed the connector when off without leakage. Lastly, the fit and finish were excellent with no burrs on the threads or marks on the body. Now if it continues to operate well, it will continue to receive the highest rating I can give it.
This is a handy gadget when you want to use an outdoor faucet for two different feeds. It is made in China of solid brass. We have been warned many times about health issues concerning materials used in China. This is no exception and has a warning that it is known by the state of California that this can cause cancer. Hands should be washed thouroughly when handling this item.Installation is very easy using the plastic gripper that surrounds the brass faucet connection. So far it has not had the leaks that other reviewers have experienced. The shut-off valves are not particularly well designed and are somewhat difficult to operate.Overall, there is nothing especially noteworthy nor particularly negative about this product aside from the cancer causing. It functions as expected and has a fairly reasonable price tag.
While I did not buy mine on Amazon (I bought at HD or Lowes), I wanted to give a positive review for this connector. I have used mine for at least three seasons without any problems. The on and off valves close completely and do not leak. They allow for a precise amount of water control so you can get just the amount of flow you want (good for soaker/weeper hoses). One thing I really like is the collar that threads onto the spigot. It has three little pieces of rubber that stick out and allow you to get a good grip for attaching to the spigot. Some other Y-connectors I have do not have this and are much more difficult to get on and eliminate all leaks.
hello,in addition to our new gilmour 1/2 inch hose, we purchased a gilmour 2 way connector.  the brass fittings shut off the water without any dribbles or leaks.  it is a little hard to twist, but it shuts off the water and redirects it to the correct hose fitting.  again, this is another gilmour quality product and everything should last for years.  just be patient with the hard twist in the valves.  it shuts it off much better than the  products at the local stores.
I have bought many similar style adapters over the years, but this brass adapter is by far the best one on the market.  Some of these have dials that are easier to turn than others, so I recommend testing them out in the store first, to see if you can move the dials easily.  They do not leak; they last practically forever; and I have one on each of my outdoor water faucets. A top item, highly recommended.  Got mine from Home Depot and Lowes.I recommend using this with a small piece of teflon to prevent corrosion at the connectors. If corrosion does take place, it can become very difficult to unscrew it.
I was impressed when I felt how heavy this connector is.  I was worried when I couldn't get the on/off valves to budge.  They wouldn't move at all.  Before I gave up and sent it back, I got out a pair of pliers.  Success!  After they had been turned once using the pliers, I could then turn them by hand.  I like the grip that helps you to attach the connector to the faucet so the switches can stay facing out.  The fit was tight and there was no leaking.  I anticipate this connector will last for a very long time.
Have You ever seen them $500.00 Water faucets at Lowes? I hate Jonesy stuff, Lowes needs to separate their store one side the Jonesy stuff the other side the practical Items.So far this Is the best shut off valve I know of, It will withstand the freezing cold better than all other shut off valves especially plastic even If It does bust the leak will Not be as bad as with plastic, also It with stands hot Water and high pressure very well, but the tightener needs to be made out of metal Instead of plastic also the knobs are hard to turn and I have to keep some pliers near by to turn It on or off but other than that Its almost perfect.
I have used many different styles and brands of dripline stakes but these are the best. I like the fact that the stake has a bug guard and cap attached to it for easy access. I put the 1/4" drip tube into the stake, clamp it down, and position it right where I want it. That is it. No more worries that the tubing will pop out.+ Inexpensive+ Bug Guard and Tube Cap+ Precision Positioning+ Perfect Size_Bottom Line_ Yes, I would recommend these to a friend. I am going to use these to stake down the tubing at each one of my emitters. I normally just lay the tube down with the emitter and hope it stays in place. Not anymore! Easy 5 Stars.
For anyone who uses dripline irrigation I share your love of it but if like me and you bought a system it only comes with one end closure for enough for two hoses!  If you want to separate your hoses because you have a oddly shaped garden or you intended it for more then one use and need to get more 1/2&#34; hose you will need more!  We have a green house on the opposite side of our main garden so we needed to separate the 1/2&#34; hose used for that to be able to run drip line to our green house we needed an extra end closure because we did not have the option of using one irrigation system because we did not even set up the rest of our garden for the year yet!  To conserve water we had to separate the system and that is why we needed extra closures!  I like this enclosure and have not had any issues as of yet!  So as with any of my reviews I will update if any issues arise!Happy Growing Season!
I purchased this to connect two pieces of tubing in an aquarium setup.  The tubing fit on very well, and seems secure.  Just to be sure, I used a pair of worm-gear clamps to be sure I didn't have a catastrophic leak at some point in the future.  This coupling is in use behind the setup - between a very heavy aquarium and the wall, and I cannot access it easily if a leak occurred.  The fit seemed tight on it's own - I only used the clamps out of an abundance of caution.
I use this to keep slugs out of the strawberry beds. I don't have bug problems in the home, so I can't verify it's effectiveness on ants,roaches and other tiny critters.To apply around the house in cracks and corners, this narrow tip applicator bottle should work very well. I was able to lay a neat border around my plants and not waste so much by the usual sprinkling out of the bag.Safety tip: If you do sprinkle out of the bag, wear gloves and a face mask. It's non toxic but you shouldn't be breathing it into your lungs.If you are using it outdoors you will need to reapply after a rain. I'll be saving this empty bottle to refill it from a larger money saving bag.I have successfully used many Safer products through the years, it's nice to have non toxic solutions to bug control.
I have a wife, four children and a dog living in my home with me and it's very important that I keep bugs out while also avoiding harmful chemicals. When I saw this brand name I was worried that it was another company trying to trick consumers into thinking that they were getting something safe to use but really the product was full of unsafe chemicals. I'm happy to report that this product lives up to its brand's name.While there is a blend of bait mixed in with the diatomaceous earth, the product is still certified organic for gardening and farming. Diatomaceous earth is ground up hard shells of fossilized algae that cuts and dries organic material so bugs that walk across this stuff get cut up even on exoskeletons, and absorbs the moisture on and in the bugs dehydrating then to the point of death. It also kills when ingested.Overall, I'm very satisfied with this product and how well it works keeping the bugs out of the house and keeping my family safe while inside.
We had lots of rain recently. The next day I noticed hundreds of specks on my windowsill. I called in the termite inspector, who wasn't able to immediately identify them either. He sprayed them with some aerosol canned air bug killer, but a few days later I saw a few moving around. My Safer Brand Insect Killer arrived and I tried it while waiting to be called back after they check those bugs out under a microscope. They still haven't called back, but any of them that made contact with the Safer Brand are no longer moving. I saw one just now moving around outside that area, so I enlarged the treatment area a bit. It appears to work well. I don't have any ants to try it on right now, but I will be back to report when I do.The ants came. The Safer Brand worked.
I used Safer Brand 5168 around our flower garden when I noticed a couple of trails of black ants trying to move in. I placed some of the powder down as a barrier around the garden the ants for the most part ignored it. I came back two days later and still found a few ants going back and forth across the white powder. It looked like it slowed the ants down but not eradicated them as I was hoping.  Maybe it was the batch I had it wasn't as quick as I would have liked seeing in getting rid of the ants.
I have ants EVERYWHERE it seems..this year they started in February when it was still cold.  I live way out in the country in the middle of the Hoosier Forest but no anteaters in sight to help with the overabundance of ants. Anyway this stuff does work..I don't like the application bottle very well.  You aim and squeeze and it blows the stuff out.  I needed to place it on a vertical strip of window casing so I have been squirting it out and then using a paint brush to dab it on areas where I need it to go.  Seems to be working.  It's messy..I don't like it but I don't like the ants either. The ants avoid it entirely even though someone said it had bait in it.  I put this near my cat's food bowl and the ants are finally leaving that alone.  So for that I am grateful and would buy this again.
I wanted to like this so badly.  We have an annual ant problem.  My husband sprays outside around the foundation, but they still manage to find their way in somehow...those tiny sugar ants.  This year, they have taken over the small bathroom off my bedroom. I've doused all visible cracks, but I'm still seeing ants two weeks later.  I have used DE in the past for pests and had good luck.  Maybe these ants will eventually disappear.  I hope so. Update...eventually I just mixed some of this with sugar water and voila!, no more ants! July update:  I haven't seen ants for months anywhere in the house.  It seems that the product just needed more time to work.  I changed my rating from 3 stars to 5.  Just don't expect this to work overnight, especially if you've had an ongoing problem with ants.
I typically useOrtho 0196010 Home Defense MAX Perimeter Granules - 2.5 lb.to work around the perimeter of my house.  The granules are easy to apply and use and they really seem to work.I decided to try Safer Brand Powder Bug killer and applied it as directed.  This is a powder and it is best applied to ant hills and as directed provided there is not the lightest bit of breeze.  It will blow around like talc and that isn't fun since despite it being called "Safer" it is hazardous too.This did not work for us.  I find the perimeter granules more effective.
I love this bottle because you can direct the powder where you want and not have to get it all over yourself.  Such a concept!I have a greenhouse of orchids attached to my house and bugs get in all the time, despite my doors.  Lots of mole crickets, roaches, and silverfish come in and also infest my bathroom nearby, creeping out my guests.  A little of this spread around and they don't come out alive.  When I visit the bathroom I have to clean up but not squish, which is a much preferable solution.As far as my greenhouse, there are many places to hide and I've found some dead bodies here and there so I guess it's working fine.  I love that it's safe for my pets and family.
This bug killer comes in a powder form. The bottle is supposed to be a squeeze bottle where the powder comes out gently when squeezed. Not much but a poof of bug killing powder came out when I squeezed the bottle and I was not too keen on breathing a fine cloud of bug-killing powder while I was applying it. So, I took off the top and applied it by tapping out some along the doorway where the ants choose to invade every summer.The ants were already in the midst of a full invasion and had survived applications of other pesticides in the form of outdoor bait traps. I re-applied this product multiple times over the course of a month and eventually the ant invasion stopped.The bad news - it took a while to work.The good news - the traditional fall encore of the springtime ant invasion did not happen so it seems to have had a lasting impact.
Take Note:  This product is not "food grade" diatomacious earth (which is what I want and searched for on Amazon), does not state that it is safe for use near pets and children, and does state that it includes a bait ingredient -- obviously it is not intended for human or pet consumption.This is not the one best suited for my uses, but should be perfectly effective, and in a handy applicator-topped bottle, for anyone using it in the absence of precious mammals/critters.
This year we are having huge ant problem. In the years before I would put 4 ant baits around kitchen and in the garage, and ants disappear, but not this year, looks like they had adapted to it. Since I have a small child, I cannot just spray poison at the base boards and around the outside of the house, or leave more baits out in the open. I was excited to try this powder to see if it helps. I applied it all in and around my trash can, entrances, outside perimeter, and kitchen floor. It seems like there are less ants after the application. Of course, after rain or cleaning session, I have to reapply it. It didn't eliminate the ants, unfortunately. I found another product which is organic spray with peppermint and rosemary oils, and I use one of the two (at different times, of course). It seems to work a bit better then the powder alone, but it is no cure, unfortunately.
I love the spray-tip applicator -- they call it a "puffer" -- excellent way to direct the diatomaceous earth. Diatoms are a type of algae and they leave behind their extremely tiny shells, which bugs hate. Cuts them to ribbons. So this isn't chemically-based or poisonous to humans (though you certain do not want to inhale or ingest it), which I like. I feel good about having this on hand vs. some kind of poisonous spray or even Formula 409 which apparently messes up the sense of smell ants use to navigate.
This product works well but appears to be tempered by the particular type of ant that you're dealing with. In my part of the world I have to deal with the regular black ants that live pretty much everywhere, Fire ants, and the big Carpenter ants. I only tried this on locations that impinged on my yard or house, no testing on locations that were in the desert minding their own business. It worked very well on the black ants and carpenter ants, not so well on the Fire ants. The powder has the consistency of flour and is completely harmless to the environment, a big plus in my book. I have pets and want to keep any chemical use to a minimum. I would recommend this but don't count on great results for fire ants. It looked like they just ignored it or found some way to get around it. Tough little buggers.
It's the same thing every spring--ants, ants, and more ants. Not only do they love to hang out in my kitchen, but this year they've decided that there are several spots on my deck railing that are perfect for staging their rallies and sporting events (or whatever those hordes of ants do when they get together). This year, I applied Safer Brand Powder to the ants' staging areas (where they get together and plan to take over my house), and it did the one thing I needed it to do--made the ants disappear.  I have spent way too much money on ant traps that do a half-ant job, and am satisfied with the Safer Powder, especially because it not only works, but it works quickly.
I had heard about Diatomaceous Earth or DE Powder from friends so I thought I would give it a try. I had an army of ants invade my kitchen while I was away on vacation so It was the oerfect opportunity to put DE to the test. I put a trail of DE along their path and within days they were gone! It's been 2 wks and I haven't seen a single ant. I would deffinately recommend DE as a safe and effective alternative to poisons. I mean,who wants poisons in their kitchen anyway?
This did work for me, but it took a few treatments and about 1/2 the bottle. We had a lot of rain around that time and that may have been the reason it took so many treatments to work. I had used other stuff, but within a week the ants would be back. This took about two weeks of continual treatments, but the ants are now gone from around my sidewalk. I can't say it killed them off, maybe they just relocated? But, they have been gone for almost two months and I credit this product for it.
I like the idea of this product -- a safe way to kill crawling insects without using a strong pesticide.  The spout is also extremely convenient, especially when trying to get it into large cracks and crevices.  I'm a little apprehensive that the product only contains 79% of diatomaceous earth and that it does not say on the packaging that it is "food grade".  I have used this in the cracks and other areas outside, but I think I will continue to use food grade diatomaceous earth when using it inside because that's what I prefer to use around my dog.  It IS much easier distributing it with this packaging rather than using a spoon or scoop with the typical DE containers or bags.
If you are looking for a non-chemical way of dealing with bugs, Diatomaceous Earth ( or DE) is an easy way to kill them without harming anyone in your family or your pets. To your touch, DE feels like coarse sand, but to insects and slugs, it is like crawling thru broken glass. It will cut them and lead to dehydration and death.Since there are no chemical components, there is nothing for the insects to adapt to. And with no liquid component, you can puff it around electrical outlets without fear of shorting anything out. In fact DE works better in cracks and narrow access points because the insects will have to force their way thru it.DE is also great for your garden as you can use it on your crops without risk to you or your family. Puff it around the base of your tomatoes to stop cutworms and if you have slugs, fill a saucer with beer and surround it with DE. You will get them coming and going.
I own two cats and recently purchased a property in a wooded area. The first time I went to the property to look at it I noticed ant traps  placed randomly inside the house with a line of ants comically walking right past the traps so when I got my Safer Diatomaceous Earth Powder, I was excited to give it a try. I placed the powder in the openings by all the base boards. Application was effortless and not at all messy. I wasn't worried about the Cats because of what I know about how Diatomaceous Powder works. In a phrase, the evidence of ants was remarkably gone within the first three days. Since then, I've surrounded the house with this and made sure to get the seams that would be hard to get. My realtor noticed the absence of ant traps and we laughed that after all my hard decorating and moving, THAT is what she noticed. But hey, when you think about it, that's a pretty big deal!
We have a really nice garden that now and then gets hit with slugs, ants, spiders, etc, however after using this powder we have cut their apperance in our garden by almost 100%. It is great to not have to battle different insects all the time and with different methods, this one covers most of them and gets rid of them. I am very happy to say our crop looks good and all our veggies and herbs are doing awesome with very little maintenance. We love this product, it works great! Definitely a buy!
Ants and anthills are a common nuisance in my neck of the woods and we are continually battling them both in the garden and inside the house. The Safer diatomaceous earth powder is effective on anthills in the lawn. I have sprinkled some of the product over an anthill (early morning or late evening is recommended) and the ants are gone in hours. However, I have noticed other anthills popping up short distances away so I'm wondering if they are merely relocating. I have also sprinkled some of the powder on our windowsills to deter ants inside the house. This also worked for a few days but we saw ants again a few days later. I will continue to use and monitor the effectiveness of the product but for now, it only seems to be a temporary solution.
I used this along the perimeter of my front door, but since it's a powder, it scatters all over when the wind blows.  I don't recommend it for outdoor use unless you don't mind it blowing all over the place.  This product did manage to keep ants away, but I have yet to see any dead ants.  The tip doesn't really help with any sort of application precision...the powder mostly comes out in poofs.It might work at keeping bugs away in areas that aren't exposed to drafts.  I like the fact that it's "earth friendly" but I need something that I can line my windows and doors with and not have to worry about insect powder blowing AWAY from where I need it most.
I live in New Mexico where odorous ants are a problem. I have used mostly boric acid based products with decent success. I've wanted to try diatomaceous earth for some time and after reading an article by a local pest control expert recommending it, I ordered a bag. I have so far been disappointed. I have only used it indoors and the odorous ants just march right through it with no apparent affect. I do suggest using a bulb duster of some kind to apply as it tends to clump when just sprinkling out of the bag. I like less toxic products and with four pounds of this I am going to continue to experiment and see if I get some favorable results. So far, unimpressed.
I'm afraid that I need to agree with the reviewers who had less than favorable luck with Safer brand ant powder.  I've had a ongoing problem with ants that come in through my kitchen door and window.  I used the product as the label directed, and applied both indoors and out.  It's been three weeks now and while I've seen a slight decrease in the amount of ants, they are still coming in.  It's possible that the ant problem might have been worse without it, considering the early warm weather.The powder is easy to apply and I like that it is safer than chemical poisons.  You do have to be careful not to inhale it when you apply it, but once it is down it doesn't pose a threat.  I just wish it were a bigger threat to the ants.  I think the product helped a little, but did not control my ant problem.
I was disapointed to find that the reaction to this organic substance did not meet my needs.I have an ant problem in my house near where I keep my parrots.The population seemed to be less but the substance did not erraticate the ants.I am also concerned about pets that could injest poisons.Ironically a covering of table salt in the doorway and along the wall seems to confront the ants digestive symptoms and keep the pests more at bay.I used to use the typical ant traps with the poison that is spread to colony,but I am against chemicals that threaten my household pets.
We have an organic yard. No pesticides, herbicides, chemical fertilizers, etc. I have used food grade DE in the past with good results and this product is no exception. I specifically applied this products around the exterior of all doors and windows to the house (30 yr old house with plenty of openings for bugs) to help cut down on the number of ants that make it into the house interior. It worked beautifully and the interior ant problem was completely cleared within about 4 days after applying this product.My only gripe is the puffer applicator which tends to dump too much product at once. I just chased each puff with a small handbroom to disperse the product more evenly.I would buy again.Was this review helpful?
I bought these hickory chips to use in my masterbuilt electric smoker. the chips work very well they give off a nice smoke and flavor. the chips are just the right size for my smoker & I'm happy with the results these chips give. there is not much else to say about these wood chips. they arrived dry there was no musty smell to them they cost more then our local store charges but they were sold out. would I buy this again probably not just because of the price of the 2 pound bag if it was a 3 pound bag then I would buy again.
I figured all hickory chips are basically the same; these prove that they're unfortunately not.I used Kingsford hickory chips (green/tan paper bag) all last summer in my old Weber, and grilled up some of the best BBQ chicken I've ever had.I recently ran out of the Kingsford, and picked up these Charbroil chips at the hardware store.I used the same technique as usual (soaking chips, putting in tinfoil, placing on coals, let smoke for final 15 minutes) and the flavor just wasn't the same. Not bad, per se, but not nearly as tasty as the Kingsford. These chips imparted a slightly more bitter, smokey flavor, instead of the stronger hickory flavor of the Kingsford.Unless I just got a bad batch, I would say you should go with a different brand of chips; I recommend the Kingsford.Happy grilling!
After pricing over 20 benches, I landed on this one as my choice. It looked great online and the price was lower than smaller benches I'd seen in stores. Still, it's always a little iffy buying something online, so I was a bit skeptical.This bench is beautiful and strong.  Mine was packed really well: despite a corner of the box getting crushed, it came in without a scratch.  Easy to build: took me about 15 minutes and that was moving slow due to the heat. The bolt/cam construction is simple enough for a child to figure out. Very sturdy: easily could hold three adults weighing under 190 pounds each.All in all, it's a great find and I have no trouble giving this product 5 stars!
This bench looks amazing.  We've had it in our garden area and had to move it to our deck so it would be more pronounced visually - it's that rare piece of yard furniture/equipment that you actually want people to see!It's also quite comfortable - we're using it without any pads, and have had no complaints sitting on it for an hour stretch.Not much (anything) bad to say about this - it was very easy to put together (4 pieces that you screw together), and just as easy to take apart if you need to for winter storage.  Was shipped/padded nicely, no missing pieces...Would highly recommend, especially over those cheap wooden/iron slatted benches that you always find in home improvement stores for maybe half price that look bad and wobble/sway when you sit in them, and last about 1 season.  This one is built better, looks nicer, and is going to last much longer.
After hemming and hawwing and comparing and studying, I decided to go for it.  There are a lot of choices online at all kinds of prices. I bought the Strathwood 3 seat bench on a Friday morning and Fedex delivered it to me within 22 hours, on a Saturday and at a $10.00 shipping charge.Assembly was simple for the two of us:  15 minutes and no tools required.  The finished product is attractive, comfortable, and quite sturdy.  What a perfect purchase!  Thank you Amazon, as usual.
I wouldn't recommend spraying this on everything - after all, caterpillars turn into the moths and butterflies that pollinate our gardens!But if you have a plant that's sustaining caterpillar damage, this is the most specific spray available to combat only that pest. In organic gardening, specific is better since you're only killing the pest that's a problem and not the bees and beneficials in the garden.I've been using Bt for years on roses and fruit trees with caterpillar issues. It's always preferable to just replace any susceptible plants with a sturdier variety, but if you have one or two that need help, this is the way to go.
This product is unnecessary when competitive products from the same company exist -- such as the Tomcat 34532 Mole and Gopher Liquid Repellent, 32-Ounce.Tomcat's bait pellets need to be administered directly into the tunnels of the creatures. You need to be aware of the environmental impact it might have on birds, and the fact that it will be lethal to other animals, especially birds and pets. As if that wasn't enough, caution should be exercised when handling the pellets since they are extremely toxic and poisonous.Why attempt to kill the creatures when it can backfire and cause harm to the humans and pets and other wildlife, when a successful repellent solution exists?
I've had a garden for the last couple of years at my current residence without any signs of moles or gophers until this year.  After noticing that a few of my bean stalks were beginning to die I began to investigate.  That's when I found a mole tunnel running around and in my garden near the bean stalks.  I had just received this mole & gopher bait  so I put it to the test.The directions are clear, although very small, and easy to follow.  Use the pointed end to poke a hole in an active trail and put about a tablespoonful of bait, cover and wait for it to work.  Well it's been two weeks now and I haven't found a dead mole or gopher but there are no new trails or dying plants in my garden.  Did the bait work or did the critter leave?  Not sure but I will use this again if I find another mole or gopher making trails through my yard or vegetable garden.
I&#8217;ve got critter problems this year and moles tend to be a constant. And as a result I&#8217;m trying a few different things. My usual castor oil concoction is nothing like this and so I found myself checking out the ingredients. The main ingredient is zinc phosphide, a far cry from my inoffensive castor oil. I do want to drive them off the property, but what I don&#8217;t want is for other animals to ingest it.We do have other animals who trespass and I&#8217;m using other &#8220;stay away,&#8221; but natural methods. What I don&#8217;t want is for other animals to dig for this in hopes of a nice snack. Not that I like the presence of red squirrels or chipmunks when they invade my home or outbuildings, but don&#8217;t want to use this very toxic poison. Think I&#8217;ll take a pass on this one.
The problem with these products is that you can't ever really be sure it is working. We used it according to the directions and have not seen any new tracks on the ground. We assume that it is working but it is hard to tell for sure! As of today we haven't seen new activity since we put the bait into the mole holes, 3 weeks ago. I will continue to use this as long as we don't have new tracks, because I assume it is doing what it is supposed to do!It does not work on pesky chipmunks, we still have those running around wild, they ignore the bait.
These pellets are applied directly deep into the tunnels of moles (I don't have gophers).  Highly toxic, gloves should be worn during the application process.  You should also wear gloves when you remove any dead moles (or gophers) that come to the surface.  This product should never be used in a manner that other birds, wildlife or pets can get too it.  Nor should it be used in garden spaces or other spots where edible food is grown.Now, with all that said, if used as directed and placed deeply into the tunnels, no harm should happen to any creature other than the mole.  We put this into tunnels that were in high traffic foot paths (human) and it took about 3 days for the tunnels to begin to collapse.  They have not returned.All in all, this product works and works well.  Just follow the cautionary statements on the label and follow the instructions to the letter.
The poison pellets are small enough to conceal in gopher-attracting baits, such as a stalkof celery.  I've learned over the years that slicing a stalk of celery length-wise, theninserting these pellets into the slit will attract, then kill the pesky rodents.The absolute best poison I ever used was corn kernels soaked in a greenish poison, but thisproduct was discontinued because dogs, cats, and birds were attracted to the corn.  This gave me theidea to attract gophers using celery or any tuber veggie.  Dogs and cats will ignore thisbait, but it sings dinner to gophers.I have no doubts that the plain pellets will kill gophers, but they sometimes will pass rightby  a pile of them.  They don't ignore veggies baited with poison.
We have moles.  This bait seems to be working... there haven't been any new mounds in a week so that's promising!  What I don't like is the applicator on this bottle, it collapses the tunnel too much, and we have to crouch down to use it (hubby has has back surgery, and I get dizzy if I kneel down and stand back up).  I do prefer the Yard Butler GBA-1 Gopher and Mole Bait Applicator because I can remain standing when using it.  But the Tomcat mole & gopher bait in the bottle, it seems to work!
It is difficult to tell for sure if a poison bait works for underground pests...but we have had moles here for 25 years.  I have tried all type of traps both from Amazon and various other traps and poison worms etc.  This product seems to stop the mole runs from appearing so quickly in the spring.  I have baited mole runs in 5 different locations on all side of our house (we have sandy soil and shade trees and a jillion worms) and it seems to have slowed them down some.  The moles are not kind enough to come up to the surface to die so you can be certain, but judging by the ground broken by mole runs, it seems to have killed some of them, so am happy with the product, not sure why they would eat this since they feed on worms, but I don't care about the science, only to get rid of these earthworm eating pests.Price is low, application is easy, and much easier than traps.
My main goal with moles, gophers, voles is to keep them away from my hosta beds. I have some hostas that were getting big and quite lovely and they seem to attract these underground critters. I have tried many techniques - solar stakes, juicy fruit and all sorts of concoctions.The pellets that we put into the tunnels themselves seem to work the best. It doesn't necessarily keep them out of our property, but as long as it keeps them from damaging my hosta beds, I'll continue to be a happy camper.I have been reusing this bottle with the pointed tip with refill pellets - saving some money.
We have a 1 acre back yard with lots of trees and shrubs, and for a while I'd been thinking about getting a chain saw.  But when I started using this Corona saw, I realized that this will do just about ANY job.  I've cut through huge tree trunks with this thing in a couple minutes.  It throws the sawdust while the strokes take minimal effort.  This is a razor-force-multiplier and not your grandfather's "traditional" saw.  I also often used it like a machete for smaller branches.  Corona makes at least 3 models, and this one is sized in between.  I use this one most often, followed by the largest one with the wood handle, and then least often I use the small folding razor saw.  If you buy just one of them, then this is the best size to get for a quick grab-and-go tree trimming escapade.
I've used this Corona pruning saw fairly extensively.  It cuts faster and more easily than any other of my pruning saws with the possible exception of a Bahco bow saw.  But unlike the bow saw, the Corona fits in tight places, like when pruning deadwood that's inside a hedge.  The curved shape of the blade provides extra "bite" and is a good feature.  The cutting action is on the pulling stroke, which is highly effective and keeps the blade from kinking.  The handle is well-shaped to feel comfortable and secure.  In sum, this Corona saw works very well and is recommended.
THis is the chainsaw that always starts!  I gave away my gas chainsaws. It was the first Black and Decker 18volt tool I purchased. I Love this because I can get a lot done trimming around the farm. I have the alligator lopper and some others that I have purchased so I have batteries for extended use but the chainsaw and I usually run down and need recharging at the same time so it works well. I highly recommend this because my friends are buying them for their husbands because they are always borrowing mine for cleaning up their property.
But in reality, for the price "I got mine for $89.99" it's hard to beat.It'll make 12-14 cuts in a 4-6" oak branch before the battery gets low. Good enough for what I want.I have the later make as mine does not have the auto chain/bar oiler. Fine by me as again it's just made to trim and do small jobs so oiling the chain every 10-15 cuts is no big deal.Mine did not come with the allen wrench needed for the guide bar plate but no biggie here as I have tools from many different saws etc.
This is an excellent, QUIET tool for yard clean-up and pruning. designed for branches in the 1 1/2" - 2 range, also good on 3" and 4"ers.  Advertised as capable of 150 1-1/2" cuts on a charge--and I believe it!--Have cut up to 6" logs with no problem, although that does drain the battery quickly. A 6"er is, by volume, the equivalent of at least 16 1-1/2" cuts, and with the extra drag of cutting across a 6"inch face, is probably more like 32 cuts. Use this tool for what it's designed for, and it won't disappoint! Why is that negative reviewer talking about cutting 2x4s? that's what your circular saw is four! do you also drive nails with your screwdriver?PRO:  Lightweight, no noise, no stink, no fuel!CON:  it does leak oil. minor irritation.
Got this primarily to cut branches about 4" in diameter.  It gets it done but it takes a little time.  I've never used a chain saw before so don't really have much to compare it to but this just seems okay.  For brances 2-3" or smaller I'd just use the long-handled branch cutter thing I bought at Home Depot, it just snaps them right off.  For bigger than 4" I think this saw would struggle too much.  So that leaves a pretty small range of usefulness, in my opinion.  The main thing that got me to buy this was that I already have a bunch of the 18v B&D products and I need a couple extra batteries anyway.  I got this with the free-extra-battery promotion so got 2 and the saw for about the price just the two batteries would have cost me.  No real loss, and I will use the saw for those occasional 4" branches so it's all good.
The landscaping in front of our house was terribly overgrown, so I popped down to Lowe's in search of a solution. Other than having no idea how to actually trim a hedge -- my wife says the result of my hard work this weekend belongs in a modern art museum -- these shears seem to be a pretty solid and useful tool. They're not too heavy and they powered through most everything I threw at it. I didn't have occasion to use the telescoping handles, but it's good that they are there in case I do ever need them.I looked at theFiskars 9178 Power Lever 10-Inch Steel Handle Hedge Shears, which were also available at Lowe's. These Corona shears open wider, which gives you more cutting power, but the Fiskars were less expensive. If you're looking to save a few bucks, the Fiskars will probably do a fine job.These shears are made in Taiwan.
If you're short, or even if you're not, trimming tall hedges can be a pain, because you have to get up and down off the ladder and re-position it every few minutes of work. The handles on these shears extend another foot and a half to keep you on solid ground and OFF the ladder.This is also helpful if you're gardening from a wheelchair or in a seated position.Now, a caveat - this pair of hedgers is for solving a very specific problem. These do not cut through thick branches or ornamental grasses easily like the Fiskars Powergear Hedgers I use in other situations. Nor are they the most lightweight hedger around.I ONLY recommend these for hedging leafy growth that is a little taller than you can ordinarily manage - for that, they do an excellent job and mine have lasted many years doing just that. For other tasks, my favorite is still theFiskars 9189 PowerGear 9-Inch Hedge Shears.
I needed hand shears to trim some bushes around my house.  Because some of the bushes are hard to reach, I liked that these have extendable handles.  It takes a little more muscle to clip bushes when the handles are extended but the shears are sharp so it doesn't take much time to get the job done.  They don't clip real thick branches but are perfect for keeping up with unruly hedges and bushes. I like the manual shears because I feel I have more control over what I am cutting.  The extended handle is a bonus.
I'm not sure since I try to keep the pests out by placing1 Pack Dispos Bait Station, Mouse Bait Station 8 Ref and bagged pellets from the Co-op underneath my home and in sheds and places mice like to habitat.  The ever faithful wooden snap traps are my least favourite method of attracting and getting rid of mice.  I only use them as a last resort as I hate having to dispose of the catch.This mouse attractant is a green gel substance that is easy to place in traps where bait is normally placed and is relatively mess free.  I did attempt to smell of the substance but can't tell what, if anything, it smells like.  It's not offensive to my nose.  This is the first time I've used this type of product.  So far nothing has taken the bait but it is summertime and I don't usually see a lot of mouse activity in my home this time of the year since the warm weather outside is to their liking.
I'm not sure what is the ingredient is in this mouse attractant but it claims that while it's irresistible to mice, it's non-toxic to children and pets which is important to me. I think peanut butter works great for mouse traps but you really don't want to sit out peanut butter in certain areas of your home like on carpet, etc. Then again, in those areas, I'm not sure I would want to set a mouse trap either. Peanut butter is effective and cheap but I can instances where I would prefer to use the Tomcat mouse attractant.It also states that it is a water-soluble gel won't stain carpets or clothing.  It's easy to use the squeeze bottle.
I&#8217;m not the person on mouse duty in my house or outbuilding.  My husband does the varmint control and does things like set the traps.  Emptying them is certainly not my cup of tea.  We rural and get a lot of field mice, especially in the barn where they tend to nest.The weapon of choice has always been simple traps, but every now and then when we get a lot, my husband has opted for poisons.  He tried this Tomcat Mouse Attractant, but still prefers the old peanut butter method.  Why?  It&#8217;s simply a lot less expensive and works equally well.
The wife saw a large mouse, thought it might be a small rat, but it was just a pregnant mouse.  I loaded 4 traps, 2 with the gel and two with peanut butter.  It took a week, and I thought the mouse must have headed for greener pastures, or was holed up with her babies, but last night we got mommy and daddy, one with the gel bait and one with the peanut butter.  The gel bait on the unsprung trap had dried, so the big gal must have had to work at it and finally sprung the trap.  The smaller mouse had stepped on the trigger.  See the vid I put on the trap review if you like, it's just for proof.
I normally use peanut butter in my Jaws traps.  This doesn't seem to attract any more mice than the peanut butter does.  It is more convenient to use - just add a couple of drops of the attractant rather than getting out a popsicle stick or something for the peanut butter. It does seem disappear from the traps, I assume by evaporation as the mice shouldn't be able to drink the liquid.  I have caught mice using it, but I also have just by putting empty Jaws traps along a wall I know they run alongside.  I will continue to use it, but doubt if I will buy another bottle.
I live near a river and some woods as a result mice and other wildlife are abundant. Mice will often make it to my outdoor shed, my garage and my basement. My shed has also been home to larger rodents.I usually use peanut butter to bait traps but that can get messy. In addition I have had rodents eat the peanut butter and not set off the trap.  All you do is place a couple of drops on the trap.  The box says it is good for rats as well as mice. I am not sure how long it lasts on the trap before more need to be used.I used this in my shed and did catch a couple if mice with it using the old fashioned wood spring traps.
While they are most active in the fall, I get field mice all year round.I've used about every type of trap except glue boards, which seem to be pretty inhumane. Never used a product like this, however.It is a dark green gel-paste that sticks to the bait cell of any trap that uses peanut butter or any other type of bait.To test it, I put out 2 snap traps, one with peanut butter, one with this gel. The peanut butter caught one sooner.Now, that isn't very telling, as it could just be the location of the PB trap.This is easier to use because you just squeeze out what you need. It isn't messy or runny.Maybe it isn't exactly crack for mice, but is is indeed a good product.
Our trap quickly caught a mouse when we used this attractant, but I have no reason to believe that it works any better than cheese or peanut butter which has also proven effective for us at attracting mice and larger pests.  In theory, it is cleaner and easier to apply this to your trap than to use real food, but in actual use, real food isn't that big of a deal.  Splitting an American cheese single four or six ways and baiting your traps is just as quick and easy as using this attractant.Bottom line: It works, but there is no compelling case for using this instead of what you were using before.
A weeks worth of data comparing snap traps baited with this, and with peanut butter.Upside, dogs do not seem to be attracted to this, unlike peanut butter.  It seems to be harder for mice to remove from the trap.Six snap traps, 3 with peanut butter and 3 with this bait for 7 nights.  The peanut butter caught a total of 4 mice and the gel a total of 3.  This is not a statistically significant sample, but it does show that it works.This will be more expensive over the long run than generic peanut butter, and like the peanut butter you should store it someplace where the mice cannot get it (I use an old glass canning jar with a metal lid).People seem to have mixed results,  I wonder if it is the type of mice they have.Not sure why they are calling this &#8220;new&#8221; since the first review is from 6 years ago, maybe they have changed the formula?
I love to cook and am in my kitchen hours upon hours everyday (I also have a cooking blog.) That said, I was intrigued when I first saw this product. It looked like a pretty serving tray, but it could be used for cooking too? I had to try it, and I love it! I made pancakes on it first and although I must admit, I was scared to try, they did not stick with or without butter.Its also useful for warming food up in the oven and since it's metal, it retains the heat after it comes out of the oven, and no need to change to a serving platter, because this griddle is a lovely serving tray too.Being a cook who has almost every kind of kitchen appliance, gadget and tool, I think this would be a great gift for such a cook, but also wonderful for the more average type cook. Highly recommended!
This is a good additional serving platter for entertaining.  When I just put out some cheese and sausage to nibble on with crackers, I put the meant and cheese on this; it seems to at least give the impression that the food stays cooler (it is a chunk of metal).I haven't used it to cook with, because I don't want to mar the finish.  I'm not sure how it would work from stove to table -- it would burn the heck out of the table if you set it down, and the little feet are farther apart than any trivet I own.I cook on both a gas and glass stove; I don't believe this would conduct well with a glass stovetop.Overall, for serving it is recommended.  Not willing to take the risk and use it for a griddle; it is too nice for that and you couldn't take it to the table after griddling anyway!
I just used it for the first time to suck up the Maple seed(helicoptors)...Pros,It does seem to have plenty of power.It definitly grinds well,Cons,1.) I don't know why these people can't make an extra tube attachment with a smaller size to get in corners and small places...2.) The zipper on the bag is on the side of the bag instead of the bottom.A zipper on the bottom makes it easier to transfer the debris to a trash bag.3.)It just does not feel comfortable,,,you would think they could design somthing that was easier to balance.
I was convinced I needed a strap-on gas blower for my large (over 1 acre) partially wooded yard.  This really does the trick quickly and without much hassle.  I put a few extension cords together and they really aren't that much of a problem.  The blower is much smaller than I would have thought, given the job it does moving large amounts of semi-wet leaves.  I found it very ergonomic.  I wasn't sore after using it and found it not the least bit cumbersome.  It was night and day from my last toro blower.  I havent used the leave vacuum because my lawn is just too big...I really see no cons to this other than I worry about getting fingers into the fan if the bottom grille isn't on. Not sure if there is a safety switch that prevents this.In short, I love this thing!!
If you use your B&D; string trimmer long enough, this part is going to wear out, as is typically gets scraped up, worn down, or cracked, when it touches the ground spinning at high speeds.  There is no generic replacement for this part, so while it is certainly overpriced for a piece of molded plastic, there really are no other practical options.  Fortunately the part is pretty durable, and B&D;'s system for automatically feeding line works fairly well.  The spool does hold quite a bit of line, and you don't have to reload it that often.Since you will need this part sooner or later, it might be a good idea to buy it at the lowest price you can get, before you really need to replace it.  If you keep it on your wish list or price tracker, you might be able to get a good price and free shipping.
This hose costs almost thirty bucks locally.  Thankfully, we got ours for just over ten thanks to Warehouse Deals.  Sometimes people just don't like something or don't know what they're getting in the first place, so they send it back, and that's when I swoop in and get a great deal.  Keep an eye out for some good deals from Amazon Warehouse Deals.  We've gotten many things at a fraction of their original prices, and they're perfectly good items with nothing wrong with them.  This is a real nice quality hose, doesn't kink and seems quite durable.  Really happy we got it, and even happier that it was a third of the local cost.  Yaaaaay!
The 8 ply Flexogen (5/8") is a staple for me, I have one on the backyard hose reel and it's lasted many years.  So I decided to get another for the front yard. Since I was "cheap" I opted for the 1/2" size; it doesn't have the pressure behind it that the 5/8" has, so next time, if I ever replace it, I'll get the larger size. The 1/2" size is fine for washing the car, watering plants and hosing off the walks, etc., but that's about all, I don't think it would be the best for pressure washing.
I don't think I've every enjoyed scooping leaves as much as I have with the Gardex scooper. I was able to scoop and gigantic pile of leaves under 5 minutes!The scoop itself is very well made. High quality plastic, easy to use and handle. I have medium to large hands and had no problem fitting them into the scoopers.Simply put them, on, reach down and squeeze the leaves, hold firmly and pick up. THAT simple and yet so incredibly efficient. A MUST buy for any home owner.By the way, this item is made with pride in the U.S.A.
When cleaning the yard I've always used the method of raking things into a large pile, turning the rake over, and scooping leaves and debri between the rake and my hand. Things always fell between the rake tines and there were several smaller piles using this method.With the leaf scoops, you can attack any part of a leaf pile you want, and the remainder will be undisturbed. The best part, it gathers many of the smaller things often found in yards. With the rake I could not collect acorns. The scoops have no problem with them.So let's see, it takes less time and less effort, but costs more than if I stayed with my old way. Given how long I think these will last and how amazing they have performed already, I'd buy a second and third pair in a heartbeat!
With two wooded acres on Spud Acres, we've got more leaves than a person can handle. Mostly I shred them with the lawnmower and then pick up to bag or compost. A lawn rake is bigger than one of these scoops, but my hand isn't, so not the entire pickup ends up in the bag.These handy scoops are as good as advertised,if not better. Using these yellow wonders I can make a large pile of leaves disappear quickly. I think they work more efficiently than a lawn rake or a couple pair of gloved hands. The scoops really shine when you get down to the bottom of the pile and can rake up every last bit with the tined teeth of the scoops.I've had my pair for several years and wouldn't want to be without them. The bright yellow color makes a misplaced scoop easy to find, especially one inadvertently left in a leaf bag.
Makes handling of leaves, shrubbery, or any other garden item needed to be picked up and disposed an easy task. I use it to pick up leaves, branches and pine needles in my yard. I went from using a shovel and my hands to using these and it makes the task so much easier and shorter.They are made of plastic so long term use is a question, but as with any item if used properly and taken care of should last a long time. Also for the price you cant go wrong.
I got this for use with racoons and it works but is awkward and one must be very careful and wear really heavy gloves when allowing the animal out.It did help me get it out to the country and I was able to capture the rest of the family.It is far better thanothers that might  hurt the animal but as I said wear those protective gloves and if you have gardeners leather arm protectors wear them as well.  The first catch was the mother and the next was the two babies well more like older teens . They are now enscounced in an old dead tree on my upstate property and are still ransacking the garbage can but at least have more room in which to plunder.
I share my farm with many animals but every once in a while one shows up that is a nuisance. In this instance I would rather relocate than shoot one that is harmless. I had a large possum that took up residence in my barn and I thought perhaps his size was a result of helping himself to my cat food, well the cat's food. Anyway, after baiting the trap with food I caught several cats and then finally the biggest possum I had ever seen. It was a male so I took it eight miles away to a protected wildlife area and turned him loose. The female possums should be so impressed with this handsome individual and I do not have to worry about him transferring disease to my horses. This trap is so easy to use because you can quickly release an animal that you do not want caught and it is harmless to all. A great help to those of us in rural and not so rural areas.
For the past couple of years, critters have taken a liking to my property. Last year I caught three possums and three skunks under my deck. This year, something dug a burrow and seems to be living under my tool barn, so I worked out a deal with the guy that has been getting rid of them: "I'll provide the trap if you'll do the rest." He agreed and I got this trap. When he heard it was a Havahart, he was less than enthusiastic, saying he preferred another brand. But after he used it he said it was a nice trap. He particularly liked the one-hand set and release. The only improvement he said could be made would be to have the trip plate come up a bit higher.Based on his professional opinion, I would recommend this trap.
After hearing about how my relatives in Missouri deal with their raccoon problems (usually involving a rifle), I decided that killing those pesky critters probably wasn't the nicest way to deal with them just doing what they naturally do, so I always wanted to try one of these traps instead.  You can very easily catch any small animal in here, and then release them miles away from your house where they can live a happy life away from your yard.  It's a quick and humane way to take care of your animal issues once and for all.
I have several of these but the rabbits in my yard are just too smart for them.  I have tried  this and a "rabbit sized" one with no success at all, zero!  I wanted the to work, I live in the city so shotguns are out.  The pests eat my vegetation during the long winters and there is seemingly no solution to it.  These look like they would work, but I have not even seen a rabbit go near any of them.  They must work for other animals, but not with rabbits.  CHRAZY WABBITS!LATER 7/11 - I take it all back, they are not too smart.  It worked on day one with large fresh carrots.  I doubt I can catch them all, but will try.  This is one easy trap to set, the carry handle also loads and sets the trap.  How easy!
We already own one of these, and when the Vine Program offered this I got another.  Over the last six years we've caught at least a dozen groundhogs as well as several skunks and cats and a raccoon.  My husband camouflages the trap with pine branches, spreads out some enticing food (apple, tuna--depending on what we're trying to catch) around & inside the trap, and without fail we get our uninvited animal.  Now we have one to loan out and one to use.  Recommend this product!!
This is a product Havahart really knows what they are doing.  They make them in a variety of sizes.  I had a chance to get this one which is the right size for me.  We live in a semi rural area and have our fair share of racoons, squirrels, rabbits, ans possums.  My only problem with these critters is when they wreak havoc on our garden, flower beds and sometimes in the attic.If you read the directions, bait and set it properly this trap is a sure thing.  We have learned to throw a old blanket over the trap after catching our rodent, it quiets them down and keeps them calm.  Our only problem at time is where to release where they will not become nuisance for someone else.I highly recommend this trap and will enjoy years of use.
Our Humane Society uses these, since they're easy to set and effective. Was thrilled to receive this, because we have feral cats living under our house. The trap is wonderful because:1. We have the cats spayed/neutered and vaccinated, then released, thereby reducing the feral cat population.2. Those who are injured (and many are, due to cat fighting) get a second chance.3. They stop spraying all around our property once they're released!4. No one gets hurt.5. Feral cats who are vaccinated and released cannot spread disease to domestic cats in the neighborhood.The trap is easy to bait and set. Even if you inadvertently trap someone else's pet, the animal is never harmed.We don't have a rodent problem, but for those who do, this fairly large trap is suitable for animals as small as gophers and as large as raccoons. Recommended.
We have a major ferrel cat problem in out neighborhood and this has been a great trap for catching the varmints so they can be handed over to the local shelter.  Setting it is incredibly easy, most cats don't fear it and the trap is quite harmless and safe for both the cat and you.I do not see any flaw in the trap that could make it better.  It catches varmints you do not want like skunks, but it isn't like it could be made to only work for the critter you want.  And cat bait is cross, but tit isn't the trap's fault.I did find a way to make it more effective.  A wireless speaker making kitty noises draws the cats to it faster.  And closing the trap for the night cuts back on unwanted varmints like raccoons and skunks.There may be a better trap, but I haven't found it.
This Easy Set trap really lives up to the name. I have a problem with armadillos digging up my hedges and plants in my yard. The first night I captured one right away, after a month I've caught 8 total. I have also caught 3 opossums, a stray cat, a rabbit and my friendly groundhog. After each capture I then transported all the animals(still inside the trap) with exception to the cat and groundhog, to a large wooded area many miles away.It is easy to carry, open and release. The price is very good for the durability, quality and ease of this innovative trap. This is no cheap Wallet Mart trap , which I have used before with great disappointment!
I have used several cage traps in my life and this one is the best one yet. Some old ones were so complicated I don't know if I ever set it right. This one? Just pull the hinged handle back and it is set.You bait the pressure plate, with the right bait. This is the most important point, you have to use the right bait for the right animal. The trap comes with a guide on what you should use. This model has a single door and that is the kind I prefer. Easier to catch and easier to release, and the fewer moving parts, the less that can break and yes after you catch something, it will do everything in its power to break out. So your trap has to be strong enough to hold what it catches and this one is.
I have used an earlier version of this trap to help rid the condominium complex where I was living at the time of invasive raccoons and feral cats by trapping them and taking them to the animal shelter.  I liked it then, and I like it even better now.  The most important improvement over the earlier version is that there is a far larger solid metal shield around the handle, which should contribute greatly to peace of mind for anybody carrying off an angry raccoon in this trap.  It's also somewhat easier to set the trap.  I didn't find this to be difficult with the previous model, but the new mechanism is a small improvement.I'll note that the axle for the trap door got stuck in the side of the box in which the manufacturer packed the trap.  This resulted in difficulties in extracting the trap from the box and necessitated a tiny bit of work to put the axle back in place.
I received the cage yesterday and at 7:30 AM today I caught the first squirrel. The cage is solid and well-made. The animal has to enter and step on the triggering mechanism to close the door cage. This is a good quality of cage because I have tested that even a light-weight animal such as a squirrel can trigger the door close. (I have another, smaller cage that can be easily triggered without stepping into the cage. It can be frustrating to find the door was shut with no animal inside). I submitted two photos under "Pikmin" name.
Got to love the Havahart traps...  So easy to set the trap.  I was recommended to try marshmallows to trap raccoons, and have had luck in the past using them.  But my new pest, (who moved into an old outhouse), arrived during the rainy season, which is hard on marshmallows, so we used tuna.  I removed the lid of a can of tuna, then squeezed the can until it was warped into oval that was almost closed.  You don't want it easy for the critter to reach through and get the prize, since raccoons are very very crafty...  Place the can in the center of the trap, and wait for morning.  Once you have your pest, you can safely use the handle to lift the cage and transport the animal to parts unknown, then simple roll the cage over, which allows the door to open and the animal to leave.  Good luck!
The trap is well constructed and ready to go out of the box. Made of heavy galvanized steel it will hold up to the elements.I managed to catch a groundhog and a bird. Plus my cat got into it twice. The beauty of the trap is it CAN catch things, and will not harm them.It is easy to set. Simply flip lever over and it is set. Unlike past incarnations of the have a heart where you have to move bars and set much like a mousetrap, this sets easier.Unfortunately making it set easier also makes it trip a little too easy. You can't move it once it's set or it will go off.Overall, though a great trap.
Havahart traps are pretty much -the- classic live trap.  I've used them off and on for decades.  They work, they are robust, and they don't break from being stored for years.  These traps are best, obviously, for catching nuisance animals in suburban areas.  Especially if that nuisance animal is your neighbor's cat.  The other good thing is that these traps are relatively child safe.  Try setting aconibearin the 'burbs and you're asking for trouble.The main point here is that these traps have been around for a long long time because the design is timeless and are very very good.  I've trapped a lot of cats (is this your cat?  It's been spraying my back door ...) and other animals with havahart traps.  The local animal control department uses them too.Please note that an unattended live trap turns fatal.  Animals can die of thirst in these things.  Check them at least daily.
If you buy this trap for the sole purpose of trapping small animals, then this is the trap for you.  By small, I mean, rabbits, squirrels, small cats, baby raccoons, small opossoms, groundhogs, etc..  If it's a BIG cat, the tail may get caught in the door.  If it's a BIG raccoon, it may not fit, or it may tear the trap apart.  This is ONLY for small critters.  With that in mind, this trap works very well and is as advertised.  It's easy to set the trap, catch the offending critter and then carry it off to release it or dispose of it at your will.  I would recommend this trap.
I really liked this grill cover when I got it. It was attractive and felt heavy duty. I used it gently to try and preserve it for more than a season, but unfortunately that didn't matter. I got a large tear on a corner within 1 summer, and a 2nd smaller rip by the second season. I garaged my grill from October-April 2 years in a row, so this never saw anything more then rain showers. I've patched the tears up with gorilla tape on the inside, but I'm really bummed that this didn't last longer, especially with one adult owner who tries to make things last.
The Good:  I use this to cover my Weber Spirit 3 burner grill and couldn't be happier.  After years of using the black cover that came with the grill, it had finally torn and disintegrated to the point where it was useless.  I bought this cover after reading review and I am very impressed.  The build quality is very high and the material feel like a professional expensive canvas as compared to the plastic feel of the stock cover.  It is truly waterproof, as opposed to the stock cover which always had condensation under it.  The size is perfect for my grill model and it has nice handles to aid in taking off and putting back on.  Overall, I highly recommend it, even if you don't need a cover right now.  Just the lack of condensation alone is worth it to me to buy since it will prolong the life of your grill.The Bad:  Nothing!
Love this Cover. I have had 2 OEM Weber covers for my 3 year old grill. I will not buy them again, they become brittle and crack within 12 months. This Veranda cover is awesome, better price, higher quality, and has awesome handles to lift it off and to assist putting back on over the grill. I have a 2011 Weber Genesis which measures 60 wide, I bought the 64&#34; Large Veranda and it fits beautifully with just enough play in the cover so it doesn't get snagged covering and uncovering, Fits just like in the picture shown. The 60&#34; weber I had, made specifically for my model grill was a bit too snug where it would actually rub against the knobs and turn on the gas while covering it up.
I bought this for my Weber Genesis Silver.  It fit perfectly over the grill.  Two things I really liked about this cover.  First, there were no vents like my old Weber cover.  Basically the vents defeated the purpose of a cover.  Dust would get in - especially during our dust storms out here in AZ.  Second, it's heavy and has an internal liner.  This keeps the bottom of the grill from flapping up and getting dust in that way.This is even cheaper than the Weber cover.
Well, as others have said this is a really nice cover.  It looks great, has clips to hold it in place, and does a nice job of protecting the grill.  But - just like anything else you leave outdoors all the time, it doesn't last forever.  I purchased mine in Feb 2011, and last week I went out to use the grill, and the cover ripped from dry rot as I was trying to remove it.  I just put a piece of brown duct tape on the outside and inside of the rip and kept using the cover.  It will last a while longer before I have to replace it.I'd buy it again, but just don't think of it as the last cover you'll every have to buy.
This *was* a well-made grill cover and though the smallest size was too big for our grill, it served us well for the first year. After the first summer, it started fading pretty badly; the bottom color is now a purple-ish color. After the 2nd summer, I noticed tears on the top, towards where the handles are. Now on our third year, there are multiple tears and the "fabric" has become brittle and tears easily. For what I paid for this item, it should have lasted longer. Each time we remove and replace the cover now, it tears a little more. So, expect to only get about two years out of this before it starts tearing (if you look at other reviews, you'll see they have the same issue, too).We do store our grill and cover in the garage 4-5 months out of the year, too.Would not recommend. Will post pics later today.
Our grill sits outside all year. We live in Northern California, no snow but very windy and a winter full of cold rain. We were buying  a new grill cover every six months. You know, the $22 black plastic tablecloth-like ones, with the white fuzz on the inside. The last one got its first rip in only two weeks!Finally, we got smart and purchased this "Class Accessories 73922 Veranda Cart-Style Barbeque Cover".  Our BBQ measures 62 inches wide. We ordered the Large size of the cover, which the amazon page states is 64 inches wide. It fits our BBQ perfectly, not too big and not too tight, either. We live in a very windy area, so the ability to pull in the bottom hem a bit with the elastic cord is a big plus.We LOVE this sturdy and good looking cover. If we'd bought this two years ago, we would have saved ourselves some money!
Two years old, still looks like newE320 gas grill.  We have used it for two winters now.  I just put it away for the spring, and was very pleased to see it still looks like new!This cover fits with rooms to spare.  The quality of the material is far superior to other grill covers I've owned, including the snapping straps.  The vented design keeps the cover from struggling to stay on in our North Texas winter windy storms.I love that the colors are light, rather than the usual black, making this look much more attractive when covered rather than looking like a big black hulk on the patio during the winter.Still happy I bought this cover, it is an excellent value for the money!
This cover is super heavy duty, attractive, and fits nicely over our BBQ.  We keep our grill up on a covered veranda, so it is already protected somewhat, but it does get alot of wind.  We were suprized to find that this cover stays in place without the ties at the bottom being used.  When we get a blizzard coming, we'll fasten the bottoms and I have no doubt it will stay in place just fine.Side note:  This cover is hheeaavvvy!  Let husband take it on and off the grill. (It's his job to do the grilling anyway....Right?!)I only gave it four stars because I need to see how it does in the summer under our high mountain UV rays.
I almost bought a grill cover when I picked up my new grill.  They even included a 25% off coupon in the owners manual.  Luckily I checked here first, and hit on this model since it was clearly the favorite.  This grill cover is as good as the reviews claim.  Includes side-vents, handles, a zippered pocket...  A very well executed product for something as "simple" as a grill cover.  Highly recommended, I'll gladly join in on the 5 star reviews for this cover, well worth the price.
First I want to thank all the Weber owners who reviewed here.  This cover is fantastic.As others have alluded, the Weber covers are what best can be described as an afterthought.These Veranda covers are the exact opposite - High quality materials, high quality workmanship, functional design, attractive and durable.The only negative is that the large size (64in) is about 2 inches shorter than the OEM Summit series 400 cover.  Otherwise, it's perfect and I expect it to last as long as multiple Weber covers.  Happy grilling!
A friend of mine recommend this product when I was complaining about the squirrels getting into my feeder all the time and depriving the birds of their dinner. This really works well. It's easy to set up and easy to fill. The birds took to it right away -- I've actually seen them form a waiting line -- and my bird seed lasts a lot longer now that the squirrels can't get to it. I also wanted this to keep away the big bully birds like the grackles, and it seems to do the trick with them, too. The perches are very small, so the bigger birds really can't get on them. I have seen a grackle sitting on top of the feeder looking frustrated, so I consider this feeder a success. I really enjoying watching the birds chow down every day, and they often stick around and sing afterwards, so I get a nice concert. Good product!
This is one of three effective feeders I use that deter squirrels.  The birds love it and visit it often, but I no longer have problems with squirrels.  The feeder is easy to fill and hang, even on a fairly high pole, since the 'hanging' wire is semi-rigid.  With four ports from which the birds can get seeds it allows for plenty of aviary activity.  While a climbing squirrel could cause seeds to fall to the ground even though they couldn't eat directly from the feeder, a baffle on my pole makes access doubly tough.  It just isn't worth it to them, I guess, since they no longer come around.  The birds themselves drop plenty of seeds on the ground and it's the rare squirrel who tries to climb the pole anymore.  I like this feeder and would buy another if needed.  Of all my feeders, this is the birds' favorite.
One of my bird feeders was constructed like a house with a porch in front and back. Birds trampling around on the porches were causing much of the seed to fall to the ground. I have had success with other Brome feeders so I decided to purchase the 1015 as a replacement. This is a superb feeder. Filling it is a simple and easy process. As soon as I filled it and hung it the birds headed for it just as soon as I walked away. The design of the feeder prevents excessive feed loss and also protects the feed from inclement weather. Squirrels hate the feeder because they cannot raid its contents. This is a great feeder and highly recommended.
IT WORKS!  There's nothing more that I love to do than to watch the birds feed in my garden at this bird feeder, except maybe for watching the squirrels get foiled by this amazing squirrel-proof bird feeder!  No kidding!  I no sooner filled it with sunflower seeds that first time, hung it in the oak tree near my kitchen window and turned my back before the birds came (even varieties I hadn't seen before)...and so did those darn squirrels - but without any luck.  Those little piggies immediately assumed the WTF attitude with me!  I still laugh watching them get so flummoxed.This Brome bird feeder is ingenious and so well made!  It's also very easy to use.  What's more, it looks great.It may seem pricey but believe me it will pay for itself in what you save on all the birdseed that the squirrels can't access.
