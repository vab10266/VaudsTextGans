This book is such a life saver.  It has been so helpful to be able to go back to track trends, answer pediatrician questions, or communicate with each other when you are up at different times of the night with a newborn.  I think it is one of those things that everyone should be required to have before they leave the hospital.  We went through all the pages of the newborn version, then moved to the infant version, and will finish up the second infant book (third total) right as our baby turns 1.

I bought this a few times for my older son and have bought it again for my newborn. This is super easy to use and helps me keep track of his daily routine. When he started going to the sitter when I went back to work, it helped me know how his day went to better prepare me for how the evening would most likely go. When he was sick, it help me keep track of how many diapers a day he was producing to make sure he was getting dehydrated. The note sections to the side and bottom are useful too because his sitter writes in small notes about whether or not he liked his lunch or if the playtime included going for a walk, etc.Excellent for moms who are wanting to keep track of their kids daily routine even though they are at work. Excellent for dads to keep track as my husband can quickly forget what time he fed our son. LOL
I wanted to love this, but it was pretty expensive for only a few months worth of calendar pages.  I ended up buying a regular weekly planner - 55% OFF! - The Planner - that is 8 1/2 x 11 and has all seven days on the right page and the left page has room to write a To Do List and Goals.  I found this to be more helpful because I could mark each day's eating and sleeping blocks, then also see them side by side - I could see her patterns more easily with a weekly view.  This planner was cute, just not what I wanted.
The Baby Tracker brand books are the absolute best of the trackers that are available. You can track naps, feedings, diaper changes, activities, and notes. They're easy to use and have a nice clean layout.I started using the Newborn Baby Tracker, which tracks nights and days. It gave me a nice way to track feedings and note important milestones. Once I used up the entire book, I bought this Baby Tracker, which tracks only days since my daughter is sleeping during the night now. Her caregiver notes her activities and sleeping times during the day. It's a great way for me to know what happened. Plus, it's nice to be able to look back and see patterns or trends.
I use this so that our babysitter (grandma) can keep track of what goes on during the day.  We've recorded so many milestones since we received this.  It is a 6 month diary and has room for notes.  I wish the hours started around 6 am and went until 8 pm, but we just write over certain times to suit our purposes. The nice thing is that if we had a rough night and we are super tired, we have something to refer to if we forgot when we last fed the baby or when he woke up. I also like that the front page has a place for emergency comments and a consent form in case your child needs medical care.  It also has a place at the back of the book for immunizations.  I'll definitely get another one in 6 months when we finish this book.
I've been using the baby tracker since the day my daughter came home from the hospital.  We're on the third one now.  It's useful for when the doctor asks how often she's feeding and urinating, but even better for looking at and realizing, &#34;Oh, she hasn't slept in x number of hours.  She's probably crying because she's tired.&#34;  But the BEST thing it has done for me since her newborn days is help me put her on a nap schedule.  I flipped through a couple weeks and looked at when she seemed to be sleeping during the day and looked for a pattern, then started putting her down for naps around those same times each day.  It helps a lot.
Of course this has been a great/easy way for me to record all of my baby's routines and a simple way for his caregiver to let me know how the day went.  What I really love about it, though, is that it was so easy for me to jot down all of his major milestones as they happened.  I knew that I wouldn't have time to work on his baby book in the beginning (and sure enough I didn't even get it out until after 2 months), and because I had this book I was able to finally transfer everything over.  Life saver!!  All of the funny little things would probably have been forgotten!
I've been using this since the day my baby was born (1 month ago) and it is a life saver!  It is a great way to track when I breastfeed, what breast he ate from, how long, etc.  Plus when pee diapers are changed and poopy diapers.  Our Pediatrician is always asking # of Wets and # of Dirty Diapers per day...so I bring this book to our appts and let her see it all.  I color code each item so its very easy to tell at a glance when he last ate, slept, or pottied.  I plan on ordering 3 more so I have enough to track this entire first year of his life!
I didn't think I would really use this and I was wrong.In the hospital they were constantly asking &#34;when was her last diaper?&#34;, &#34;when did she eat and for how long?&#34; - ummmm I was on pain killers for a c-section and a mass of hormones. I finally got this out and started keeping track using this.Yes, you could just use regular paper, but I liked the layout of the pages and it was just what we needed a we slowly lst our minds for the first 6 weeks.I an on giving this as a shower gift to the next first time mom :)
I have used this book since my son was born.  It's a great and handy way to keep track of when and how much eats and when I change his diaper.  Makes it easy to discuss his progress with his doctor.  This journal is great for his grandparents who watch him while I'm gone.  They are able to maintain his schedule and it makes it very easy for me to see how he is doing while I'm at work.  Highly recommend this journal for all parents of children especially for those with little ones under a year of age.  I'll definitely continue to buy this every 3 months until at least my son is a year old.
I have used this tracker for all 3 of my children and swear by it! It is super easy to leave by the baby's changing table or crib and jot down things throughout the day (feedings, dirty diapers, nap times, etc). I also used it to jot down other important &#34;mile stone&#34; things that I would have quickly forgotten&#8230;like outings, temperature readings, visits from friends to meet him, calls to make, when we stopped swaddling him, etc. I was able to use it as a resource when (many months later!) I went back to formally fill out his baby album since I would have forgotten so many of those valuable little tidbits of information & memories.
We found this book at a rummage sale and found it to be so useful, especially when several people are helping with the baby (ex: visiting family, etc.)  We loved it so much that I've bought another one and have almost filled that one too.  I like having the room to write things about our baby's day and development, plus use the "Notes" section to write some story, etc.  It also helps "Dad" see what has happened that day and feels more connected.  I will be buying another one soon!
I have been using this baby tracker for three months and it has been very useful.  My little one had feeding issues and it was necessary to explain his habits and behavior to the pediatrician and several lactation consultants.  His feeding issues also contributed to sleep issues, which I was also able to track in the journal.  After weeks of sleep deprivation, the Dark Period, I could easily respond to the pediatrician's questions by referring to entries in the baby tracker.It's nice to look back at the Dark Period and see how far we've come.
Love this book! Just finished our first one and am starting a second one.  It makes life much easier knowing my child's meal and nap times. Much easier to plan you day around baby when you can start predicting what their schedule will be for the day. Excellent for communication for when you don't have your child. Even when I'm at work, that night I know exactly how my childs day has gone just by looking at his book. Plus it makes it easier on the caregiver to learn childs patterns as well. I recommend this to all new moms! Especially during those first few weeks/months when growth spurts are common and you can't remember anything because you haven't slept much!
THis has been helpful in tracking the feedings, diaper changes, naps and other developmental things for our little one but I REALLY wish they had laid it out so that you could leave it open and have the left side be AM and the right PM.  The way the pages are set up you have to flip a page to see a full day (starts with PM on the left and A.M. on the right).  It's a nitpick but if they had just let the user fill in AM or PM then the pages would be identical and you could look at a full day at a glance (with your hands full, holding a baby).  Sort of a pain to have to lean forward to pick it up and flip a page over just to see what happend prior.
I bought this tracker when my daughter was 4 weeks old. I was having problems remembering how much she was eating, whether she was sleeping better or not. This helped me keep track of those things and more. I could look back and see if there were any changes in her eating habits - it wasI started using it like a little journal that my daughter can see when she's older. I kept notes about her moods, what she did during the day. It even became a good tool to use with my nanny once I went back to work.
While I love the app on my phone (Baby ESP) for my husband and I-- it's not realistic for someone filling in to download the app. Our parents, who frequently watch our baby, have yet to embrace the app world.So, we use this on days when we have help. It keeps track of everything the doctor will ask you. (How many poop diapers, how many pee diapers, how often are you feeding, how often is he sleeping, what's his schedule like). We usually end up entering the data when we get home so our app can tabulate everything for us in easy to read charts.I kind of like this too because it helps us to review what was going on during the day while we weren't at home.
This was a lifesaver especially during the first couple of months.  Being a new mom (and dad) we were exhausted and I can't imagine trying to remember when the baby was last fed, changed, etc. without something like this by our sides 24 hours a day.  It is a good size and plenty of room to write everything down that you need.  It is laid out very well and easy to read/understand when handing off care from parent to parent (or whoever).  Once this ran out I bought another type of journal and am wishing I had just bought this one again.
I loved this tracker so much, I bought several more and used for the entire first year. It's a great way to see a new infants progression toward feeding and sleeping schedules. In the sleep deprived first weeks it was so helpful in keeping track of diaper count, feeding sides,  etc. Once we introduced solid foods, I could track when I offered new foods to watch for signs of intolerance.  I just purchased again for new baby's arrival. I highly recommend for new or seasoned moms.
Both of my boys (1 and 2.5) love stacking and building.  They also love cars.  So this was an obvious choice for a great toy for them.  They both love these cars!  All of the cars have a little &quot;surprise&quot; (the ladder on the firetruck &quot;clicks&quot; as it raises up and down, the siren on the police car spins, etc.) &amp; they are all numbered which is great for counting and number recognition as they get older.  They're also a great way to teach abstract concepts like smallest, bigger, biggest.
My daughter received this as a gift when she was born and when she was on her tummy I used to line them up for her to look at and try and grab.  The bright colourful colours really held her attention.  When she was sitting we played the &quot;Mummy stack them, Baby knock them down&quot; game and &quot;peek-a-boo&quot; with the smaller colours under the bigger cars.  They proved to be a favourite for pushing around the floor as she was crawling and something to chew on (especially the small green one) when she was teething.  At 2, she still sometimes gets them out of the toy box to stack and knock over.  She is now teaching her baby sister the stack and knock over game!  Great for learning big and small, colours and numbers.  Good value!
These are a huge hit with my one year old son.  We received these cars as a gift when my son was first born.  He started taking a real interest in them when he was about seven months old and still plays with them every day.  They are simple, durable, do not require batteries, and are easy to clean.  We've traveled a lot with my son and these make terrific travel toys as they pack up easily and don't take up much space since they nest.  The smallest car rattles and is the perfect size for little hands.
I bought this last month for my 6 month old son, and it continues to fascinate him.  It is fabulous to encourage moving and crawling as I set them around him and they slide away as he reaches for them -- its been invaluable in encouraging him towards crawling and scooting. When he does get hold of them, exploring the ladder on the fire truck develops his fine motor skills too, and he like chewing on all of them and shaking the rattly little one!  He'll probably soon be able to work the sun roof. It will be a stacking toy later too! Great value for money...
This is a wonderful toy that is fun, educational, and affordable! The cars are different colors, and each has a different number, 1 - 4, to help a child learn counting and colors. They also stack on top of each other and nest inside of each other.(The nesting feature is great for storage too). Each car has a neat fun feature for little ones to explore (e.g., the small car is also a rattle, the large fire truck's ladder moves, etc.) The cars are also very sturdy (as has been proven by my son repeatedly banging them together,) and they are easy for little hands to grab onto. At 6 months of age, my son really enjoys looking at the toys, passing them from one hand to the other, banging them together, and, of course, putting them in his mouth. I imagine this toy will remain one of my son's favorites as he learns to stack them and roll them on the floor. I would highly recommend this item.

I had a homemade quiet book when I was a kid and saw some on pinterest.  Since I don't know how to sew, I visited Etsy to see if I could buy one from that site.  I couldn't believe the prices!  I found this and ordered it for my three kids (9 mos, 2 years, and 3 years), and they all love it.  It's pricey, but it's good quality and much easier on the pocketbook than others.  Great book, and I love that all the pieces are attached!
This book keeps my 2-year-old entertained for a decent amount of time, and I like that it's washable.  It has a good number/variety of activities in it, especially as compared to other similar types of books.There are some activities for babies, but I think toddlers/pre-schoolers will get the most use out of it.  My daughter has a hard time getting the snaps on/off (they require a little extra &#34;elbow grease&#34; and/or for you to hold down the fabric on the page).  There are also some &#34;older&#34; activities, like the clock, or tying a shoe.Overall, good purchase.
The teether just arrived for my ten month old who seems to be cutting his second tooth.He's already figured out how to activate the vibration.  It is soft, yet has some ridges and bumps that he is pulling with his teeth and gums.  I think baby gives it 5 stars!!!There were contradictory reviews on whether the batteries were replaceable or not- the packing says they are NOT.  So unless whoever said they were replaceable is just handier than the rest of us, they do not appear to be replaceable.
I got this as a shower gift but could not use it for awhile. The handle is kinda big and the chewing surface kinda wide. It also takes a lot of force to get it to vibrate and that took a while for my daugher to figure out, at first I had to hold down one of the corners for her while she chewed on the other. Once she got a little bigger it was a much better toy for her. But don't get me wrong she loved it when she was itty bitty she just needed a little help from mommy.
I like this product a lot, but was very excited to receive it to apply on my 5 month old who is starting the whole teething process... the product vibrates great, the colors are attractive to her, and as soon as she sees it its the first thing she wants to grab. However, its a little heavy for her and in order to make it vibrate I have to hold it because it requires more strength than her tiny mouth has at the moment. Hopefully as she becomes stronger she can use this product better. But overall I really like it.
We have another vibrating teether that is very similar to this one, there are some differences though.This one is much softer on the outside which could be nice on tender gums.This one has 3 points that she can use to pin point the problem area.Each point has a different texture (bumps, ridges) so there is some varianceThis one seems like it is easier to activateI will say that I don't know if she favors one for the other.  It seems like she uses them both about equally.She also likes to play with it by making it vibrate on her hands, feet, cheeks etc.  We have had a lot of fun playing with it.It's a great find and I wish I had come across it sooner.
This is one of my twin sons favorite teethers, but they are only six months old and right now it is too heavy for them to hold by themselves, so we have to sit and hold it in their mouths for them.  This is not a huge deal, and I'm sure in another month or so they will be able to manage, but I just wanted to let other parents know that this is not something you can just hand your baby.  Having said that, when we do hold it for them, they love it and want to gnaw on it for at least 15 minutes or so.  Also, it is different from other teethers in that when they are done using it, they don't seem like they are still in pain and need to go gnaw on something else.  They actually seem like they feel better, so we are able to give them less ibuprofen which I feel is really a good thing.
My son has had this teether since he was 3 months old. I thought maybe he's just too young & not interested in it(even though he did have 2 teeth already) He is now 8 months old, and still isn't very interested in this teether. The reason I bought it was because it was in-expensive and easy for him to hold & pick up. He would rather pick up a toy car, or some sort of stuffed toy, which I understand every child is different. My only big complaint - the star bead on the end. It is hard, and pointy. If it catches my son's sore, in-coming teeth the wrong way, he will cry. Other then that, the colors are great, and definitely catch baby's eye. Overall, it's an OK toy for the price.
I was skeptical at first about 'babywearing', I tried it once as a joke with this sling that was given to me and fell in love. It was one of the only places besides the breast that my daughter would fall asleep consistently for the fist 4 months or so.  So I agree with other mothers who say that you have to give it a chance to grow on you. It may seem strange or uncomfortable at first but I still use my sling with my daughter and she's 18 months now. She sits on my hip and watches me do the dishes or fold laundry. Hands free is the way to be!The sling I was given was a bit large for me, and I'm not a tiny person 5'3'' 135lbs. Although it was adjustable I think for my next child I'll try a sling that comes in sizes.
I got this carrier before my son was born. I was a nanny and have tried many carriers with babies of various sizes. This is the most comfortable and versatile carrier I've tried yet.The downsides are that it is a little challenging to use. I have had to learn quite a few different ways to carry my son, who is just 3 months old. If you don't adjust the carries you use as your baby grows, it can be very uncomfortable for both you. It is also very bulky. It doesn't even fit in an empty diaper bag. My next carrier will be unpadded.
My son loves this.  He likes the &quot;kangaroo&quot; position best. He was actually crying the first time we put him in it this way, and stopped immediately.  DEFINITELY make sure the one you buy comes with the video, though.  At our Babies R Us many were just in plastic bags (returns?) without the book and video.  They are a must.  The usual type carriers which have baby putting all their weight on their pelvic bone aren't good for their developing bones.  Slings keep the baby in more natural positions.
I ordered this as a spare for my original Co-Sleeper. There really aren't a ton of places you can buy these, so I wasn't too concerned about the price. All told, Baby Bungalow did offer it for the best price, including shipping.While the sheet is a perfect fit, I was perplexed by the 'button' holes on the under side of each corner. Can't imagine what those are for. That or my Co-Sleeper is on the older side and there have been design changes since.Overall, quality product.
I purchased a total of 4 of these, thinking I needed to change the bedding constantly due to spit up.The instructions said to hang dry only so I thought I needed more to get through the week.  It turns out I can just toss it in the dryer and put it right back on the mattress.Had I known I didn't need to hang dry, I wouldn't have purchased any extra and just went with the 2 they gave me when I purchased the cosleeper.The material is average, nothing special.  It holds up well to lots of washes and uses.
The shipping was quick. The colors are pretty but the sheets themselves are not soft. That was disappointing to my daughter who I bought the sheets for and of course to me. They are not inexpensive so I expected more. I purchased five sheets to go with the co-sleeper I bought her for their first baby. We have not assembled the co-sleeper yet but when I received it the box was all torn and dented. Looking at it the contents looks okay, but we will see when the my son in law puts it together.
This is a fantastic product. It has a lot of room to store the dirty diapers, and yet there is little to no smell. You know when it's full because the plunger won't go down all the way, and you can't return the handle to the other position. When you take the garbage bag out, you can tell just how much smell you'd be in for with any other container. I also like that you can use whatever garbage bags you want with this, instead of having to buy special ones. A good buy.
Before my first child was born, I was all set to buy the Diaper Genie but then a friend told me about the Diaper Champ. She said that it did a good job and I didn't have to buy any special bags. So I went out and bought it along with a big box of tall kitchen bags. My son is now 4 months old, and so far it is working great. It is in the nursery and there is no smell at all. I am usually very sensitive about any bad smells, and so is my mom but even she couldnt smell any odors. So far this has been a great product. The lid is definately tight, but it does not bother me much. Hopefully, it will still work when the diapers get REALLY smelly! But so far so good!!
I bought this primarily because it takes regular trash bags, we used it the way it's supposed to be used for the first couple of days but quickly discovered that as the pail gets full the dropping mechanism gets stuck forcing you to clean out the mechanism whenever it's time to change the pail, and it's one more thing to wipe down if a diaper gets too messy.  Also, my husband would load the diaper into the top but routinely forget to flip it over to dump the dirty diaper.  Now I lift the whole lid and toss the diaper in, this allows me to keep tabs on how full it's getting and squeeze in a few extra that the mechanism wouldn't have allowed... and still trap the smell!  Of course this negates the cool mechanism and makes it a plastic trash can with a tight lid, something I could have bought for cheaper.
I love this product...  My sister in law has a baby 4 months older than my daughter, and she has a diaper genie.  She is stuck having to buy the special cartridges.  So even though the Diaper Genie is less expensive, in the long run, the Diaper Champ turns out to be the one that is less expensive.  Plus with the Diaper Champ you can flip the handle and away goes the dirty diaper. With the Diaper Genie, you have to twist the darn thing and it's hard to operate.  My mother in law almost always has problems with the Diaper Genie at my sister in laws house... she ends up cutting the bags.  When she's at my house, she can't go wrong, just flip the handle! The Diaper Champ is hands down the winner!!!!
I registered for the Diaper Champ after seeing the reviews and I cannot talk enough about it. I just live it!!! It is odorless(so far) and very easy to use - and only with one hand, so you can SAFELY keep the other one on your baby. It's very easy to change the bags, which you can use any 13 gallons one - no expensive refills to buy!!!! I just sprinkle some scented baby powder or spray some Lysol Disinfectant spray everytime I change a bag, to keep it from smelling even a little bit.I highly recommend the Champ, you will not regret it!!!
It makes so much more sense to just use regular kitchen trash bags, more cost effective. It is easier to use. There were no smell problems AT ALL until about 18months - 2years old, well "hello - diet change produces stinkier diapers". Makes sense. . but still use it for wet diapers. Hopefully potty training will happen soon! :)The only down-side, is that babysitters are so "diaper genieized" they pop off the side handle trying to do it the wrong way. But the good side is, it is easy to pop back on.The diaper champ is really durable. I highly recommend it to anyone!
I truly believe this is the best diaper pail on the market...  It's simple to use, can take any garbage bag, and does a fantastic job of containing odors.  BUT, my complaint is -- why couldn't they make it bigger?I've heard it's the biggest one you can buy, but I find it frustrating that my regular kitchen-sized garbage bags are only 2/3 full when the Diaper Champ requires us to remove the bag.  It's wasteful!  (I know the simple solution is to buy smaller bags, but I feel the product should accomodate the most common household garbage bag -- the "tall kitchen bags" -- and do it efficiently.  The whole point of getting the Diaper Champ was so that we wouldn't have to buy separate bags for it!)
I like the Diaper Champ.  My little boy's room doesn't stink from dirty diapers.  I empty it once a week, when it is time for trash pick-up.  I like the fact of using regular trash bags instead of having to buy special bags.  I do wipe it down a couple of times a month.  I have also put in a box of baking soda to help absorb the odors inside.  I highly recommend this product.  It is very easy to drop in your dirty diapers.
I've had this diaper pail for 3 years now, and it's been through 2 kids (both in diapers for 18 months of that!).  I love this diaper pail! My favorite feature is that it doesn't require special refills--it can use any trash bag (we just use a tall kitchen trash bag).  My 3 1/2 year old still hasn't figured out how to open it, but it's easy enough for me to open quickly.  The only times I have had a problem with odors is if too many diapers are stuffed into the pail.  Even then, these odors can be minimized with a bit of baking soda sprinkled in the bottom of the pail.Although I debate the necessity of ANY diaper pail, this one receives 5 stars from me!
I bought this pail before my son was born. First we bought the Safety 1st Odor-less pail, but it was broken, and the store was out of stock when we returned it. I read the reviews and found this one sounded the best.I love that it is so easy to use. My husband didn't even want a diaper pail because he didn't expect them to hold in any odors at all. Now that we have this one, he loves it. It's so easy to flip the lid and away goes the diaper. No twisting till your wrist breaks. At first we were using scented trashbags, but I've switched to grocery bags and they work just as well. I change the bag about once a week with either kind of bags. My son is now three months old and wears size 3 diapers. The only problem we've had is that if you don't close the diaper tapes they can stick and jam the pail. All in all it's been a great buy.
I have three children.  For my first I had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky. I would not recommend buying that one.  My second child I didn't get any.  Now for our third child I saw the Diaper Champ and figured why not register for it and try it out.  I have to say that I am very happy with it so far. I did dump a little deoderizer tablet in it. I am happy with the fact that I can use any bag in there and dont' have to pay out the nose for replacements.  It's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers.  I haven't noticed any seepage of smells.I would recommend it over the others on the market.
We bought this primarily because it had better reviews than the Diaper Genie when we bought it and that we don't have to buy special bags. I love that you can use trash bags. I haven't had a problem with the bag not being full enough. For one, when the Champ is full the trash bag is a bit more then half full, but is also very heavy so you wouldn't want anymore diapers in there anyway. The only problem I've found with it was when my sister-in-law put my 2 year old nieces diaper in there and the smell lingered a bit. Her diapers are MUCH different then my 3 month old son though. So overall I love the Diaper Champ!
I have no doubt that my wife and I will be happy with the Diaper Champ (our first baby is due in two weeks).  But we have had to expend quite the effort to find one that actually works.  The first Diaper Champ that we bought had a  piston that would not drop (the plastic joint did not meet and thus caught the piston on its way down).  The replacement Diaper Champ's piston moved just fine but the drum would not flip over easily.  It took two hands and a foot securing the bottom of the can to the floor to get the drum to turn.  This is not one handed operation as the box states.  After a third trip to the store we finally found a Diaper Champ that works.  And you do not even need to ask.  Yes, it was made in China.
At only 3 weeks old, my son goes through about a dozen diapers a day.  We have the diaper champ in his bedroom and it's been great so far.  (We'll see once he switches to solid food and his diapers are a bit more stinky!)  It's so easy to use and you don't have to buy the special bags.  We've used kitchen trash bags as well as large plastic shopping bags like the kind you get at babies r us.  One recommendation - get a can of Lysol and spray the diaper champ down when you change the bag.  Overall, I love this diaper pail and would buy it again in a hearbeat!
The diaper champ is such a great product.  I keep it in my baby's bedroom in a corner and it has never produced any foul odors.  I love that I can use regular trash bags with it.  I only have to empty the bag once every 2 weeks (since most of the diaper changes happen downstairs).  But, even going that long, it does not smell.  I would never use one that required refills, what is the sense in that when this one works perfectly?!
I have used this for 11 months and I love it. What we did was after the baby started having odor in his #2s we bought some of those diaper bags from dollar tree (100 for $1) and put the dirty diapers in those little bags. So easy! Never an odor problem. And I use regular kitchen garbage bags in it, so no special bags to buy.I did research when I was registering before the baby and looked at all of the other diaper pails and this one was the one that came out ahead. I am glad I researched it because I am very happy with it!
the diaper champ does it's job: it collects dirty diapers and conceals the stink. of course you have to clean the whole thing out from time to time (which should be expected considering the toxic waste it stores!), but i never had any issues with smell, unless it was so full it had to be emptied anyway. what sold me on this diaper pail vs. the others, is that this one takes ANY plastic bag you want to put in it, meaning grocery bags, trash bags... nothing fancy. as a new mom (or new parent) you have enough things to worry about and spend your money on; last thing you need is to head to the store for diaper pail bags. no complaints from me on this diaper pail.
I love this product.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is b/c I use cloth diapers and diaper covers, and it doesn't have a whole lot of room for this type of diapers.  It lasts me about 2 days.... 3 if I really stretch it.It has no odor, other than when you open it, but that is inevitable.Infact, the Babies R Us in my area uses this product in their &quot;mother's room&quot;.  That seems to say alot!And the best part is that its cheapest over the long run... no special bags to buy... what a pain that seems to me.  I use plain old garbage bags... or even very large shopping bags.Great product.
ALL DIAPERS SMELL, no matter what you put them in, especially once your kid starts solid foods. Get over it. This pail is fantastic.  We use it for our dogs' poop bags, and line it with Ruffies scented trash bags (we use vanilla, they also have lavender, and they are cheap). There is no smell, except in the summer when it is hot (and that's only because the pail is outside on the back porch, the one we buy for the nursery will be inside in the air conditioning).
What I liked:  Contained the smell.  Ease of use.  Takes regular garbage bags (saves money!).  Great capacity (empty it out once in 7 days or so). Sturdy. Easy to clean - I wipe it down with Clorox wipes.What I didn't like: Not especially good-looking and at times the lid gets stuck in a certain position (could just be a problem with mine) hence the four stars.Would buy again though and do recommend it. (I have used the Diaper Genie at a friend's place - didn't like it).
We orignially registered for and received the Diaper Genie and had problems with it from the day our son came home from the hospital.  When he was three days old my husband took it back to the the store and announced that he was coming home with the Diaper Champ.  We LOVE it!!!  The fact that it uses regular garbage bags is a huge advantage and we have never had any problems with the smell. . .impressive considering some of the dirty diapers I have seen my son produce.  He is now six months old and the Champ works as well as it did when we purchased it.  In addition, it's very easy to use.  Just flip the handle and the diapers fall through to the bag.  Couldn't be simpler.  We love this product so much that when I see people at the store looking at the Diaper Genie vs. the Champ I will go up to them and tell them to select the Diaper Champ.
I love this diaper pail...you can use any trash bags...I like the variety that are colored and scented for a nice touch! It's so easy to use. I didn't have any problems with odors til my daughter got older than 12 months. Once she started eating more "real" foods, her diapers became much smellier. She's now 19 months and the Champ is still a Champ. We empty it a little more frequently now than we used to because of her smellier diapers, but I think it's a great product!
I purchased this diaper pail after struggling for several months with the Diaper Genie.  The Diaper Champ was hands down the best diaper pail I used while my child was in diapers (I used three: Diaper Genie, Easy Saver Diaper Pail, and the Diaper Champ).  I didn't have to spend loads of money on the special Diaper Genie bags anymore, it had far superior odor control as compared to the Easy Saver Diaper Pail, and it's really easy to use - drop a diaper in, flip the handle over, done!  I actually developed pain in my elbow from all the twisting the Diaper Genie required as it wrapped each diaper into its little sausage-like casing.  I passed this diaper pail on to a friend once I was finished with it, and will happily purchase it for other friends in the future.
I love this diaper pail. Yea, if you let poopy diapers sit in it for too long and don't change the bag on a regular basis it will start to stink but  c'mon its a bucket full of poopy diapers.As you child grows, or if you have older children watch out. The handle system fascinates  little ones and they find it amusing that they can put something in, flip it and it disappears,  which is good when it's a diaper, bad when it's,,, your keys.
After reading all the reviews on-line for this product I chose to register for it, now that I am using it I am disappointed.  I'm not sure if my sense of smell is just that of super hero's or my daughter has super smelly diapers.  Either way her room does have the smell of dirty diapers when you enter and the "Champ" is in the back corner of the room.  I guess I'm just grateful that the whole house doesn't smell as bad as her room.
This diaper pail is excellent. No odors have escaped the pail in 3 months.  I am very pleased with it.  I do have one word of caution: Make sure there are absolutley no diaper tape edges hanging loose when you flip the cylinder.  They can rip out the filter that keeps the odors inside.  Baby Trend will expect you to send the pail and the original receipt back to them for repairs if the filter comes out. I found that to be a joke since I got this as a gift for my shower (no receipt) and the repair would take six weeks (how I'll never know why).  Fortunately Babies R Us will allow you to exchange the damaged item if it has been 90 days or less.  Save yourself aggravation and make sure everything that goes down is bundled up neatly.
My main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn't even fit a smaller sized garbage bag. The hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as I am now using medium diapers (I have a 3 month old) and they're on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact I make then and how un-soiled they are. I have no issues w/ odor but baby poop doesn't start to smell really bad till they start on soilid so odor will not be a problem no matter what till then and that's many many months down the road.
This is another great baby purchase.  When I brought it home, my husband laughed at me and said that it was just a "gadgety" baby thing that we didn't need.  He changed his mind though after we put it into use and saw how well it worked!First, it really keeps the odor in.  I'm pretty sensitive to smells, but this one does a good job of containing odors.  Just to play it safe though, I make sure to empty it every day and a half to two days or so (you could probaby go longer), and I spray it with Lysol as well.  Keeping with that practice, I haven't had a problem with bad odors.Secondly, its economical--its not expensive to buy, and its not expensive to maintain.  Its nice to be able to use regular garbage bags and not having to buy expensive diaper disposal system specific bags.No bad odors and not expensive to buy or maintain---I definitely recommend this product!
You can't put poopie diapers in this pail, it doesn't hold the smell back at all.  I use it for the wet diapers and it's fine.  I use the scented bags for the poopie diapers and throw them away in my regular garabage that gets taken out every day.  Opening the pail to empty the bag is a little difficult, but it's better than having to buy special bags for it.  The big blue round part on the side broke off for some reason and it wouldn't go back on.  I ended up using masking tape to hold it on.  It serves it's purpose, but I'm not thrilled with it.
Someone told me not to get the Diaper Genie, but invest my money in the Champ.  What sold me on it is that the Champ uses ordinary garbage bags, nothing proprietary.  As my baby gets older and the poops get stinkier, we do have some odor problems, but we tend to cram the diaper bags as full as possible.  If we changed it every couple of days, there would probably not be an issue.  When we smell something, we change the bag; problem solved.  My only *real* problem with it is that, now that my son is walking, he likes to put things into the hole and turn the handle to watch them disappear.  I keep waiting for the day when he throws away something important and I don't catch it!
My sister had a Diaper Genie and it always smelled really bad. She constantly complained about it so I opted to try the Diaper Champ. Boy am I glad! It is so easy to use especially since you can use regular trashbags vs. genie refills and the diaper is gone w/ a flip of a handle!! My son is 9 months old and we have NO SMELL PROBLEMS!!! I don't know how some people can complain about smells coming from this thing...it's sealed up like Ft. Knox. You never see the inside of the pail until you empty it. The canister pushes the diaper into the trashbag, thus never allowing odors to escape through the pail. I would have to say the only way you may have an odor problem is if you never empty it!!!!!!!!!!
This one is the best and a must have! Don't waste your time or money on the other ones.  The Diaper Genie is way too complicated.  It's a trash can so it should be simple.  I shouldn't have to read directions on how to use it!  This one is great because it is so easy to use, I never smell any odor, and it uses normal trash bags!  Why spend money on special trash bags?  I like the cheap roll of scented trash bags for like $2.00.  They work great and they are small so you can keep them in the nursery for quick and easy trash changes.
We like it that this diaper pail uses regular garbage bags instead of specialty diaper pail inserts/liners.  The mechanism works well to dispose of the diapers and attempt to keep the smell isolated, but at a certain level of the room (usually nose-height when you're sitting on the floor) you can still smell poo.  It works well to bundle the diapers into compact little bundles and use the velcro to seal the bundles before you put it in the diaper hole.  Overall, we are very satisfied.
I read a review below that can explain exactly what we experienced. We've had it for 16 months and it has worked wonderful for us. No smells, change it out once a week, easy to clean. Then a diaper snagged this foam material in the head part, so I pulled the rest of the foam out. Big mistake!!! Now it can no loner retain the stinkiness and we're looking for a replacement. Be careful of overloading and never take out that foam piece that is cushioned between pieces. I have figured out that it is key to keeping the stink out.
If you really want to save money, but still get a quality product, buy the Diaper Champ.I had a friend recommend it to me, and another friend recommend the Diaper Dekor.  When it came down to it, I couldn't make myself spend the extra money for something that needed expensive refills. Every time you have to buy refills, it is almost as expensive as buying a new diaper pail.  Let's face it, babies are expensive and whenever you can save $ you should!!!I buy a box of bags at Target that I use for the kitchen and the Diaper Champ and they cost less than ten dollars for over 100 bags.My only complaint is that it is hard to get the pail open at first to change the bags, but it gets easier over time as it loosens up and you get the hang of it!If I had it to do over again, I would still buy the Diaper Champ!  I think it is great!
Works well as diaper pail, but it's awesome as a bathroom garbage can.  No mess, no smell. Very easy to replace garbage bags, you do not have to touch anything.Got it as a gift, and was very skeptical about it at first. (It's only 100ft to the garbage  shoot outside the apartment).  That opinion changed quickly after the first night I had to wake up to change diapers.It holds about 2 days of diapers so never get a chance to stink things up.  Besides you baby will probably poop only 1-2 times /day.
I initially planned to get a Diaper Genie.  I opted not to because of the expensive refill bags.  I'm glad I didn't buy it.  We live in an apartment and have the Champ set up in his bedroom.  I don't smell any odors unless I open the Champ up to change the bag....which is expected when you have a bag filled with wet and soiled diapers.  We use scented Glad bags to help mask the odor, which helps.  I don't know how it will perform when I switch my son to formula and when he starts solids, so I give the Champ 4 stars.  I'll probably just put the wet diapers in it and take the soiled ones out to the garbage can.  I would definately recommend this diaper pail to my friends.
I had never liked the idea of the Diaper Genie because of the refills. Not only can they be a pain to install, but who needs one extra thing to watch a supply of? I mean, with babies it's already far too easy to run out of diapers or formula. I couldn't picture myself yelling to hubby, "Honey, I know you have sixty other things to get...can you also pick up refills for the diaper pail?"The Champ works great. We use regular kitchen sized garbage bags. We've never experienced odor from the pail. It was easy to assemble, and the diapers fit perfectly into the little nook before they make their way into the pail portion. I also love that you can flip the device with one hand...Highly recommended!!! Makes life easier and keeps baby's room smelling like baby, not dirty diapers!
The Diaper Champ has been wonderful in our home!! It locks away the smell so wonderfully that we purchased a second one for downstairs. I originally chose this one, because it doesn't use costly refills. The lid is quite heavy, so you do have to be careful of your fingers when changing the bags, but that's the only concern I've had with it. When you do open it to change the bags, you may want to do so outside. You'll quickly see just how well it locks the odors in.
It holds almost a week's worth of diapers, and you don't need expensive refills - any kitchen bags work.  At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!  It is also to wipe clean if you do get the chute a bit dirty.  I second that you just need to fold up the diaper (with wipes inside) neatly, but that is not a big deal.  The latch isn't terribly difficult, and I wouldn't want it to be too easy since it sits in my son's room.
THis is the only one I have ever used, and i have to say I LIKE IT! It is easy to use, i just put in a white trash bag and dumped the diaper down the shute. It holds a ton of daipers, and the smell is not bad at all. I did notice now that my daughter is 15 months her poop is stonger and i dont put those in there, due to the smell. But diapers with pee only do not smell at all. The only bad thing is you need to ensure you dont get #2 on the shute or if you do it will stick there. It is really easy to use, and doesn't take up a lot of space.
The Diaper Champ came easy to assemble- only took 2 minutes to put together!  The design is simple, yet brilliant, and the odors are sealed inside the Diaper Champ until the bag needs to be changed.  Our baby's room never smells!  We didn't even think about buying the Diaper Genie because we thought the idea of buying special bags and odor discs was ridiculous.  We normally use standard tall kitchen trash bags, but if you're into reusing plastic shopping bags you can even use them in the Diaper Champ (although you'd need to change the bag everyday...BUY IT!
I bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and I absolutely LOVE it!  I used to work in a daycare and we had a diaper genie.  It was such a pain to use.  We all hated it.  The diaper champ couldn't be easier to use.  And the biggest plus is that you don't have to buy any expensive refills.  It takes regular trash bags.  I generally put kitchen size bags in it, but you can use just about any size if you are in a pinch.  And it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained, which the diaper genie never did!  If you are looking for a user-friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained, than the diaper champ is the one for you!
We got this and the Diaper Decor Plus as gifts and I have to say that the Champ is not my favorite. I like that you can use your own garbage bags with the Champ, but that's the only positive in my opinion. I find it pretty hard to open it without breaking a nail and it does get fill up much more quickly than the Decor. When you're changing the bags on the champ, it can be messy, depending on how long you waited to change the bag, but with the Decor, you just open the front door and knot the bag even if it's full to the brim--so much easier. I also like the Decor because you can dispose of the diaper with your foot, instead of a hand like with the Champ, because now that my son is super squirmy on the changing table, I need of my hands on him!
Let me just say this... After being a nanny for almost 10 years I have tried them all. This one is really great. I actually took a friends word on it and went with this Champ when registering and I am glad I did. I just knew all along what products I would not use, but was undecided on the actual one I wanted. Well the Champ has survived it's first year with our son and it is great!! We just bought another for baby boy number two coming next month. The thought of not having to buy refills and just using regular bags is awesome! We just buy the smaller bags that come like 250 to a roll and are sented and they are like $6.00 and they work great. We just recently had to buy another roll of bags. SO $6.00 for a year of bags- can't beat that!! We lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems. Would reccommend to anyone and everyone!!
We just couldn't bring ourselves to buy a pail that required us to purchase extra refills.  This pail is great.  I do put really dirty diapers into a plastic shopping bag before putting it in the pail, to reduce the chance of nasty seepage and rub-off onto the chamber as the diaper is moved into the bottom.  It is not difficult to open, and the fact that it has a good clasp offers a sense of security for when our little girl starts pulling herself up on things, which will be soon (she's 8 months old).  We change the bag a couple of times a week, and the nursery smells fine.
I love the Diaper Champ!  Everyone I knew had the Diaper Genie but had to buy expensive refills and did not like all the twisting involved.  After reading reviews of the Diaper Champ, I put it on my baby registry and I am glad I did.  It is easy to use, keeps odors contained, and uses regular trash bags (much cheaper than diaper pail refills).It was a little tricky to open the first few times because I wasn't sure how the latch worked.  Also, be sure the tabs on soiled diapers are secured to the diaper or they will get stuck up under the cylinder on the way down.
We also wanted the diaper champ instead of the Genie because...who wants to buy special bags??  It is a life saver to just throw in a kitchen garbage bag.  We ended up receiving ours as a hand-me-down, and I was worried that it would smell.  Surprisingly enough - it only starts to smell when it's time to change the bag. And sure enough, the lid would start "sticking" right about that time, which told me that the bag was full and it was time to change it (instead of struggling to stuff another couple diapers in).  Since we are new parents, we'd sometimes make a mess trying to toss a dirty diaper in, but it's SO easy to clean.  Just keep some Lysol wipes by the changing table, and wipe it down if you get anything anywhere. Piece of cake.
The flip action is so easy to use that even your toddler (or your foot) can do it to make diapers and smell disapper.  (Now that my baby is older and stinkier, I notice a faint smell if I stand right over it, but I just sprinkle some baking soda in the bag, or you could but a couple charcoal brickettes in the bottom, or any other of the 101 odor absorbing remedies out there.)And practically speaking, stratch another item off that long baby shopping list--with this you can forget the diaper pail refills and just use the good old kitchen garbage bags that are sitting under your sink.
I was quite pleased with this for the first 6 months. Now as my son's diet is changing, the odor of his bowl movements can no longer be contained. We always tightly wrap our diapers and I even tried washing it frequently but after about 3 or 4 days the stench comes right back and now I'm at a point where it's just taking too much time and effort to maintain. There is one serious design flaw though - the pail is tapered such that the bottom is noticeably larger than the top (probably for balancing purposes). The problem is if the diaper bag gets too full it makes it really hard to pull out the diapers.Pros:- cheaper than alternatives- worked great the first 6 months- was able to use normal garbage bagsCons:- smells after 6 months- bad tapered design makes it hard to remove diapers
I registered for this diaper pail as opposed to a Diaper Genie because I didn't want to have to purchase refills.  So far (3 weeks), we've had no problems with the Diaper Champ at all.  It contains the smell from our baby's diapers and we can use just about any kind of bag inside.  I also sprinkled baking soda in the bottom of the Diaper Champ to help absorb odors - every once in awhile I just empty the old baking soda out and replace it.  I don't know if we'll run into trouble down the road with odors, but so far I have no complaints and I'm very happy not to have to buy those refills.
I thought about getting the diaper genie at first but then did some research. This is the best for your money! Not only was it less expensive than most other diaper pails, it also works the best. The only time smell escapes from it is then you open it to take out the bag. I really love how you don't have to buy bags for it, and that it takes perfectly good trash bags. That will save you a bundle of money alone! It works really great for us and we wouldn't use anything else. I wish it would hold more diapers but I really can't complain. Don't buy anything else!
When my hand-me-down Diaper Genie broke, I bought a Diaper Champ. I figured I'd save some money not having to buy the Diaper Genie refills. While I was happy about being able to use regular trash bags, that was all that really impressed me with the Diaper Champ.The odor protection of the Diaper Champ really leaves something to be desired. My son's room smelled very badly, even when I changed the pail every day.Changing the Diaper Champ really isn't a pleasant experience. Not only does the odor of multiple nasty diapers spew forth (nothing is sealed) when you open the lid to change the trash bag, but the trash bag is somewhat difficult to position correctly.Well, I'm back to using a Diaper Genie, and my son's room smells just fine. Save your money and buy something other than the Diaper Champ the first time around.
I decided to get this diaper disposal system instead of all of the others for one simple fact: NO REFILLS NEEDED! You use any type of bag you want, and I love this idea. The refills for all the others are so spendy and they don't hold that many diapers. I'd rather buy cheap 13 gallon garbage bags from wal-mart or use one of the gazillion plastic grocery bags we already have in a cupboard at home. It also keeps the smell away perfectly fine-until you open it of course to take the bag out to the garbage can! It's so easy to pop a bag in or out as well. I think it's great and I highly recommend it to every family that loves to save money.
Unlike the Diaper Genie, the Diaper Champ can be used for both disposable and cloth diapers. We have two of them since we mostly use cloth, but occasionally need to use a disposable. It's great, and very easy to use, but you do have to empty it a couple of times a week or you will get a little stink from all the rotting diapers. It's so easy to use, my 18 mo old daughter figured out how to flip it and started doing it for fun. She's now 2.5 and still loves to flip her training pants into the pail.
I'm not sure about this one.  In concept, it's a fabulous idea.  I love that you don't have to purchase expensive refills.  I just go to [the store] and purchase tall kitchen bags and use those for the Diaper Champ.  The cons, at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth.  In addition, I don't believe that it is odorless.  My daughter is only 4 months old and we do notice an odor...I'm concerned that as she gets older the #2 diapers will only get worse.  If I had to do it over again, even with the cost savings of using any type of bag, I would go w/ the Diaper Genie.
We have purchased this diaper pail four years ago [I was so disgusted with Diaper Genie we had at the time (not just wasting the money on the refills, but also the smell and having to push & twist was more than I wanted to deal with)].Diaper Champ was so much easier to operate! When my daughter turned one, she started disposing of her diapers herself and she never failed!We used regular grocery bags and changed them twice a week to avoid them getting too full and/or smelly. [We've discovered that regular shopping bags from Target are larger and sturdier than your average grocery bag and we're now using them with daughter #2, replacing them once a week]. We have NEVER had any problems with DiaperChamp, and we're still using the one that we purchased in 2001! It's virtually indestructible, easy to wash and operate, doesn't cost you any more money than you initially pay for it, and it DOES NOT SMELL!I would highly recommend this product to anyone.
We purchased the Diaper Champ instead of the Diaper Genie because we didn't want to buy special bags.  We have now used it for a year and it has been great!  We can use our regular garbage bags so the cost is very minimal and we don't have to worry about going out and buying those special bags like for the Diaper Genie.We use cloth diapers and it works really well for that.  We change the bag almost daily, as we have two in diapers and cloth diapers are bulkier.  When it gets hard to turn, it is time to change the bag!The Diaper champ really minimizes the odor and is very easy to clean up, we just wipe it with a soapy cloth and sometimes spray a little disinfectant to help with the smell.This is great and I would recommend it for everyone.
Love the Diaper Champ.  I had planned to get the Diaper Genie, but after I read the reviews, the Diaper Champ won out!  I love the fact that the Diaper Champ accepts any kind of bag, and you don't have to purchase specific bags.  That's way too much of a headache and expense that I don't need.  It's also super easy to use one-handed which is important with a squirmy infant either in your arms or on the changing table.  It took me a few minutes to learn how to change the bag, but that, too, is easy once you figure it out.  We haven't had a problem at all with the smell, but we do wipe it out with Clorox wipes every so often just to make sure.  This is one of those baby items I wouldn't want to do without.
I love this diaper Champ. I got it as a shower gift and hadent heard of it before but when I started using it I had to tell all my friends. This will definatly be my gift of choice from now on to all my pregnant friends. As other reviews say the smell isnt that great when it gets full but its not that bad (I see it as a hint the bag is full and its time to change). I also spray the inside w/ febreeze or lysol disinfectant during each change and that nips the problem in the bud. Overall, Its one of those things that I cant live without but didnt know it until I got it.
I love this! I was hesitant to buy too since the "sheet" is expensive and hardly a "sheet" at all. But once I used it, it made changing the crib in the middle of the night speedy, letting baby and ME get back to sleep quicker.First off, it is soft to lay on, absorbant and waterproof. If baby's diaper leaks it only gets on this sheet. You can take the sheet off easily by just removing the snaps attached around your crib slats. We have our crib matress dressed in an additional regular crib sheet underneath with a cheap matress pad below it. This allows us to make it thru the night without having to make a full crib linen change--- at least until morning.I will certainly buy this as my gift to all my friends baby showers!
Our son uses the babi italia pinehurst classic crib...bought the ultimate crib sheet for it but it doesn't fit the crib very well. It is good for backup use if my other regular sheets are in the wash though. It just has problems fitting around the big 4 corner crib rails so I am forced to attach the snaps on the regular rails instead which makes the sheet not be able to stretch to look completely flat.Today I just found another use out of it though after feeling that it was a waste to buy this. My son has been pulling up to stand and teething on the top side rails and actually made teeth marks with paint coming off! AH!  So I improvised and used this crib sheet to cover the top rail, it fit perfectly in length and snaps perfectly together to stay on.  It would have cost about the same price to buy an actual[...] rail cover so it works out.  He usually only teethes on 1 side too!
I bought this based on good reviews in the Baby Bargains book, so I had high expectations. It does make it somewhat easier to change sheets in the middle of the night, but you still have to unsnap it from about 10 places on the crib to do so; I've also found the snaps a little difficult to engage. If you're not using crib bumpers, the look of all the elastic pieces on the crib slats isn't too attractive. I'm glad to have one of these, but it isn't the miracle sheet I hoped for.
Here's what I like about this product: it's easy to change, and it provides a leak-proof barrier between the baby and the mattress. Here's what I don't like: the snaps are not a great fit for my crib and sometimes come undone; one snap stopped working altogether; and the sheet wrinkles and is difficult to smooth out.All in all, the good outweighs the bad. The sheet is particularly handy for newborns who might leak during the night, requiring sheet changes when you're half asleep. I only use it now when I know he is prone to leaking, such as when he is between diaper sizes. Otherwise, I use regular sheets. Put it on your registry.
It's kind of weird to be putting a cover over your crib sheet (and never having to change the crib sheet), but these were a lifesaver after my daughter started leaking poop like crazy overnight.  Changing the crib sheet daily was NOT fun.After I got this, it got a bit easier.  It's not super fast to unsnap and snap on, but better than replacing the crib sheet (esp given I have a mobile that gets in the way of taking the mattress out).I have 3 of these so I don't have to immediately wash the dirty one.Only con is that the material seems a little rough.  Not as soft as the crib sheet fabric, unfortunately.
It's a nice thick pad and seems comfortable enough to use in place of a sheet everyday, but it's too expensive for a sheet and because it has the rubber bottom, you can't really put it in the dryer without harming it. It takes a long time to hang dry. If it were less expensive, I'd get a few more. So I use it as a water proof pad and put a sheet over the top of it, but that takes away from the ease of putting it on the mattress, since It gets tucked in the fitted sheet.
I have been using these sheets for 6 months.  I have two Ultimate Crib Sheets, and when my 6 month old has diaper leaks or blowouts while sleeping, I can easily switch to the new ultimate sheet.  They are machine washable and dryer safe, which I LOVE, considering I am doing baby laundry multiple times a week.  Putting regular sheets on crib mattresses is a huge hassle, so the Ultimate Crib Sheet is a huge help for middle of the night diaper leaks.  It takes me much less time to switch these out than to change the whole sheet.  I leave baby's cute sheets on the mattress and use this on top.Size: Both of mine shrank a tiny bit in the dryer, but it is not a problem at all.  They fit flat on top of a regular crib-size mattress.Material:  The top side is a breathable, soft cotton layer.  The bottom side has a soft, waterproof plastic feel.
I found the ultimate crib sheet to be much more trouble than it's worth. Lifting my daughter's mattress takes no effort: it's made of  lightweight foam. As a result, changing her sheets is also super easy. I just have to lift the mattress, and it takes two seconds. On the other hand, snapping all the ties on the ultimate crib sheet takes bending over the crib for five solid minutes (plus, the manufacturer recommends snapping the snaps before every wash, which means snap on crib, unsnap, snap again before wash, unsnap, snap on crib...) So, if you have a foam mattress in a corner of the room, I'd suggest just getting normal sheets and some of those stay-dry liners. If you have a coil mattress and keep the crib in the center of the room, then by all means, try the ultimate crib sheet...
My mom said to get enough crib sheets because it was something you had to change constantly.... I now have a drawer full of crib sheets that have never been used!  This is the best thing ever!  we put one on, and have the other one for an emergency.  It is soft, the cotton is excellent quality and the work of crib changing at 3 in the morning it just went from 10 minutes to 1 minute! nothing can bit 9 minutes of extra sleep in the middle of the night
The baby isn't here yet.  But we've bought a couple of these.  I'm a tad hesitant because they don't fit very well on our convertable crib.  They do give instuctions, saying to just use a slate next to the thickers corner one(for convertable cribs), but I find it fits very awkwardly.  However taking the whole crib apart(with the bumper being a huge deal, also to get on, considering the thick corner posts), it makes me want to cry to think I'd have to do this very often.  So, we'll give these a shot.  I may end up doing the zip on sheet set, which would work with any crib, and seems like a dream.  I've also heard great things about those.  I just didn't want to invest in that, if I could get away with these.  Will let you all know, if these turn out to be a disaster.
I really wish that I had this when my son was a newborn and all those midnight crib cya gongs could have been avoided. This is a really great and easy to use product. It is definitely one of the first things that I recommend to parents and I'm glad that we will have it around for our second child. Make sure tha you buy a backup one or teo for those late night changings. This came in very handy when our 18 month old went through potty training and just for any other leakages or accidents that kids sometimes have.My only complaint was that when we washed these in the wash, some of the snaps would break off. also, on a side note, as cheap as these are from Amazon, I have also been able to find the same brand at TJMaxx and Marshalls for half the price.
When my son was a newborn, I was able to fold it in two and placed a blanket on top to make it a little more comfortable because it is kind of scratchy.  Now at four months it is at is full length and I still put a blanket on top of it.  Whenever he gets it wet I just take the blanket and the cover and wash it easily.  I don't have to mess with the fitted sheet and trying to get it off of the mattress which is so hard since they are so tightly fitted against the crib.  This makes life simple and cleaner.  You can use it anywhere.
I thoroughly enjoy this product. It covers the full top surface of the crib, give or take an inch. My daughter has used 3 of these over the last 3 months. The upper material is soft and smooth with adequate middle absorption so that it catches excess moisture. I used one on her crib on top of a decorative sheet, another doubled over in her playpen under a practical sheet (since the playpen pad can't be easily washed), and a third to replace whichever one she soiled most recently. I have not yet had any problems with her getting underneath it. The snaps work well on small crib rails. They may not fit around larger crib posts. I highly recommend this to any new mother with an appropriate crib. At 3am, I love not having to wrestle with the crib mattress.
UPDATE: After washing them only a few times, the snaps have been falling off so this sheet is not very sturdy. I now call it a "disposable sheet" and would rate it only 3 stars if I was allowed to change the rating.My previous review:This sheet is a fantastic idea. Imagine waking up to feed your baby only to have them spit up and/or poop/pee on the bed sheet. Instead of taken apart the bumper to remove the mattress to change the sheet, all that is required is to unsnap the corners that secure sheet in place. Then you put another one on...the whole process will take you less than 5 minutes. I have three, one for the hamper, one on the crib, and one waiting to be used in case of a bed wetting!
The concept of this product is good, but I found the snaps extremely difficult to snap and unsnap (maybe they get easier with a little wear, but I haven't used it enough to see).  Therefore, I found it both quicker and easier just to take the mattress out all together and use fitted sheets (which are also more attractive).  I would only use this product if you have a mattress/crib set that have a fit making it extremely difficult to get the mattress out.  Seems like most crib mattresses slide out pretty easily, making this product pretty unnecessary.
I registered for the Ultimate Crib Sheet after reading reviews in books and online.  All the praise is accurate!!!  It's better than the standard sheet savers because it covers the entire top of the matress - not just one part.  It snaps securely in place and can be changed in seconds!  I keep the regular crib sheet on the mattress for looks only (matches bumper and skirt) - baby never actually comes in contact with it.  Get two or three Ultimate Crib Sheets for easy changes - SO much easier to change than the regular sheets...removing and replacing the bumper for those sheet changes is a huge pain and time consuming.  This product makes cleaning up so easy!  The only drawback is that it only comes in white, but since it can only be seen looking INTO the crib, it not a big issue for me.
These are the only sheets I have ever used in my son's crib. I bought one regular sheet to cover the mattress, and I've never taken it off. I just use my Ultimate Crib Sheets. I have three; I would recommend that number. I can't imagine how much of a pain it would be to have to lift the crib mattress up to change sheets...this is just SO EASY snap, snap, snap and you're done!I never dry mine in the dryer. I hang it on a drying rack and it's usually dry after a few hours. I want mine to last, and using the dryer tends to wear them out. I've never not had one on hand, with 3 total.
I thought this looked wonderful in the store so I registered for a couple.  Afterwards I attempted to put a cute sheet and mattress pad in the crib... such a chore!  I started using these and haven't had to change the cute sheet since.  It's so easy to just snap on and not fuss with anything else.  It's a soft sheet on top, an absorbent layer in the middle, and a waterproof vinyl back so nothing leaks through.  I've changed it in the middle of the night in a couple minutes tops... it washes up great with my baby's normal laundry too!  I highly recommend these sheets.
I love this sheet!  I have 4 of them (2 for each child). It is super absorbent and stays in place! They are great for potty training accidents and for one unfortunate night with the stomach flu.  I used to wrestle with matress when changing the sheets but not anymore.  I have the pretty sheet that matches the bedding on the bottom and the crib sheet on top.  Now if there is a middle-of-the-night accident I just unsnap the cirb sheet, pull it off, and put a clean one in its place.  This is one a the gifts that I give at all baby showers because I think no Mom should be without at least 2 of these (you need a spare!)
This is such a helpful product that helps keep the baby's sheets protected. I love how it has saved me from changing the entire crib sheets off of the mattress. It's saved me money since it protected the crib sheet so well that I haven't bought any new crib sheet. I'm still using the ones that I received during my baby shower. The elastic snaps definitely serve a purpose for safety so I use them but they are a little tiresome. If there were a better, yet safe, alternative for the snaps I would have given this product 5 stars. Overall, I'd highly recommend this product.
The first time I went to change the crib sheet on my baby's crib I understood the importance of the Ultimate Crib Sheet!  It was given as a gift & I put one more on my registry after realizing I had to take the whole crib ensemble apart to change the sheet!  Now I change the sheet only occasionally & it is more for asthetics.  The Ultimate Cribe sheet snaps off & I put a clean one on - so easy & practical!  Save money on sheets & just get one or two decorative sheets & get at least 2 of these!!!Update at 7 mos (July04): I have survived VERY WELL with 2 of the Ultimate Crib Sheets - and boy when they start slithering around the crib & wetting through diapers & spitting up solids - you will be SO thankful to have this little dandy item!  Don't go without!!!!
I use this on top of my crib sheet when my crib sheet is dirty and I don't have a replacement.  So in that sense it's helpful.  My daughter doesn't pee through her diaper so I haven't used it for liquid leaks.  It can probably hold a lot of pee, but the real question is why does your kid need this kind of protection? (unless you put them to sleep without a diaper on!)  I find all the snaps to be a pain in the butt.  If I could do over I wouldn't buy this VERY EXPENSIVE crib sheet.  I'd just get multiple regular crib sheets.
I absolutely love the idea of this crib sheet. After receiving one as a gift I immediately tried putting it in the crib. To my disappointment, the elastics at the corners will not fit around the wide posts of my crib. For those of you that have Italian made cribs (I have a Baby Italia), this sheet may not work for you either. This should come as no suprise since it is also harder to find crib bumpers that fit correctly too. Needless to say, if you have an Italian made crib, keep the packaging and the receipt. You may find that you'll have to try another brand.
I bought three of these before my son was born and it was money well spent - we bought one cute sheet that goes with his bedding that we leave on and change the ultimate crib sheet as needed. Believe me, when your little one spits up in the middle of the night and you need to change the sheet, you will be so thankfull you just have to unsnap and put a fresh one on. Changing crib sheets with a bumber in place is a major pain! These are super soft, hold up to repeated washing, stay in place and absorb the mess away from your baby. Return all those cute sheets you bought and invest in a bunch of these - you won't regret it!
Reality is...you don't have to have this, but it really helps simplify your life if you do.  You don't have to take off the crib bumper and lift the mattress to take off this crib sheet.  Instead, you just unsnap and place a clean one on top of the mattress.  I have a regular crib sheet under the Ultimate Crib Sheet for decorative purposes and in case he needs to be placed on it if my spare is dirty.  I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because it's annoying to have to snap all of the straps prior to washing it and also because there is some shrinking that occurs after it's washed (Make sure you put it on the low setting in your dryer).  Also, they are expensive.  I have two of them and it's worked out just fine.
The strings ripped off when I tried to pull it off of the crib. I also didn't like the idea of this being on top of the mattress and crib sheets. So it might be a good idea if you don't have a great baby mattress or aren't into decorating the baby space. At first I thought this product was clever, but once I got it I realized how useless it was. It's so easy to take the crib sheet off of my baby's crib, so I really never needed this.
I had bought this sheet on the recommendation of others from Babies R Us.  The snaps make it a breeze to change, I'm so glad I don't have to take the mattress out of the crib all the time!  The waterproof backing is great not just for the diaper leaks but also for the spit-ups.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the snaps don't fit exactly around my crib rungs so it's a little wrinkled and off center, but my baby doesn't seem to mind.
This is a great product!  Buy two and put them both in the crib.  When your little one leaks in the night, just unsnap and toss the dirty one aside, and you'll have a clean one underneath.  As far as the snaps falling off, my son had pyloric stenosis (severe vomiting requiring surgery) and I washed these 3 or 4 times a day for weeks.  Never once did I have any of the permanent snaps fall (there are two completely detachable snaps on the ends that I don't even use).  I even washed and dried on the normal cycle (not gentle) in warm water (not cold, as is recommended).
I bought this, put it on the crib, took one look at it, took it off, and returned it.  I have a standard 28x52 crib and this was too big for it--it bunched and wouldn't lay flat.  Also the snaps didn't match up well w/ my cribs slats and even if they did they were too long to actually be safe and secure.  This mattress pad/sheet creates an unsafe environment.  My daughter slept w/ us or a bassinet until she was 3 months old and by then the diaper leaks and constant spit up were behind us so I don't have to change her ordinary crib sheet that often anyway.
I have never changed the sheet on my daughter's crib.  Instead, I have 2 ultimate crib sheets that I alternate between.  I can't tell you how awesome it's been.  In general, they're easier to change than regular crib sheets.  In a pinch (ie, diaper explosion or sick baby in the middle of the night), they make life SO much easier.  Just fold the sheet up to contain the mess, take it to the laundry room, snap the new one on, and you're good to go.I've read reviews that said they didn't like this sheet, but I love it.  You don't need any other mattress pad with it, either.
I played the game of frustration everytime I had to change a crib sheet......which became much more often after more blow outs and spitting up began!  I knew I wanted to keep the bumper and searched the internet to find a solution.  This was the first recommendation to pop up with rave reviews!  I tried one out and absolutely loved it! Changing sheets is a breeze!  They stay one very well too.  I liked it so much I ordered another to have as back up.  Highly recommended if you are done lifting that dang mattress up!
The Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet is a very useful product.  It protects the sheet, eliminating the need to change the crib sheet if there is diaper leakage or spitting up.  It goes on and off in seconds - so helpful to a Mom, especially in the middle of the night. It is large enough to cover the whole crib surface.  It seems to be waterproof and yet doesn't make the baby sweaty.My only concern would be that since it attaches to the crib rails, there is an outside chance a baby could loosen/undo a strap.I think it would be handy to have two of these to rotate them out.  I like it and would recommend it.
Lifesaver for this middle of the might diaper leaks! It's always a pain to change a crib sheet in the middle of the night, but this makes it so much easier. I just put it on top of his regular sheet (which is over a waterproof mattress pad). He occasionally has a diaper leak. When he does, I simply unsnap the ultimate crib sheet (there are roughly 10 snaps to keep it in place) and let him sleep the rest of the night on his regular sheet. The snaps can be a little tricky to remove with one hand (say when you're holding a baby), but I generally start unsnapping while he is still in the crib.
When my newborn was in her Co-Sleeper, changing wet bedding every morning was no big deal -- but a move to the crib meant a HUGE daily struggle to disassemble the bumper, manhandle the mattress and strip the sheet and mattress pad, then reverse the whole process after washing and drying. The Ultimate Crib Sheet is truly that: just undo a few snaps and toss it in the wash. It's soft and durable, and your expensive bedding and mattress pad stay fresh and dry. In hindsight, wish I'd had several of these on my registry.
Seems to fit just fine except that the corner snaps could be longer.  We have a Sorelle Rosa crib with hidden hardware so the snaps must go around the outside of two bars for each corner.  The straps are just not long enough to effectively go around all 4 corners.  No big deal though as we just do two corners and then go around the first set of bars on the far side.  So the sheet is offset by a couple inches but doesn't appear to have enough slack to become a safety issue.  If our baby does start to try to get under the sheet it doesn't seem like a difficult task to just add our our strap extensions.  We'll probably be buying a few more to allow for more time between laundry runs.
This pad has worked well for my son. He is 3.5 years old and we are trying to potty train him through the night. It's nice not to have to wash an entire sheet and mattress pad every time he has a small accident. It has never leaked and it's been washed many times and still retains its waterproof quality. The only reason I took off one star is because it's a little stiff and he was resistant to having it on his bed at first. He got used to it and now it is working fine.
The method that I used for potty training had me completely throw away the diapers and didn't allow for pull ups.  (It worked well!)  About a month after we started my daughter had a string of accidents at night out of the blue.  I was constantly changing sheets and was tired of it, that is when I found this.  Turns out my daughter was sick at the time, but once I got two of these it was so easy to just move her and take this pad off to wash it instead of stripping and remaking the bed.  I wish I had known about this when I first started potty training (for nap time and bedtime).  It is also relatively small to pack if you are traveling somewhere and you are afraid of your child wetting the bed this is great for that too.  I now have this off of her bed again, but I can't say enough good stuff about this product.
I got this because it used regular trash bags and you don't have to worry about a huge long twisted snaky thing unraveling when you take it to the trash.  I've been using it almost a year.  I do use those cheap Bowl Fresh toilet deodorizers instead of ordering the disks.  I clip the hanger off and break it in half (while it's still in the plastic) and add half or both, just depends.  The deodorizers last about 1-2 months and it's cheap! I empty it about every 3 days and spray it down w/ Lysol before adding another bag.  Not had any stinky problems and this is in my hallway right by the familyroom. I do take it outside every month and give it a good cleaning w/ bleach and a garden hose.
My husband and I picked out this diaper pail when I was pregnant with my son because friends told us to get one that uses regular garbage bags. That turned out to be the only perk of this diaper pail. The springs have been popping off since about the first month. My son is now 10 months old and recently one of the springs broke, which completely gets rid of the supposed &quot;odor-free&quot; feature (which I found wasn't exactly true either).  Now that we are expecting baby #2 I am going to have to buy another diaper pail to replace this one. My advice: Don't waste your money. It's just as efficient to throw your diapers in a regular trash can.
Yes, my spring broke as well... but looking on the brighter side: when my son is old enough to walk he won't be able to accidently press the spring button to release the pail cover... it's kind of an unexpected safety feature! And yes, you can still open it with one hand... your fingers are not glued to one another. Really, diapers will stink no matter what pail you use.... The covered pail is cheap and doesn't require buying refill bags (especially since we use cloth diapers).
Initially my husband and I decided not to purchase a diaper pail because we wondered what was the point, diapers stink and no matter how much money one spends on a diaper pail it's going to emit odors and smell bad. Then, when we were changing diapers ten times a day we decided it would probably be easier to have one, especially for the middle of the night diaper changes. Several of my friends disapproved of the Diaper Genie and recommended we purchase an inexpensive diaper pail that uses regular garbage bags. We took that advice and selected the Safety 1st diaper pail and we are pleased with the product. Odor-Less - No. We empty it as needed, usually once a week, and realize it's a diaper pail - just as our garbage pail in the Kitchen needs to be emptied daily someday so will the diaper pail. I place an aroma jell in the little basket which helps with the odor.
I really like this diaper pail.  It helps with odor control, but is certainly not odorless.  As if anything can disguise the odor of a poopy diaper.  I think that a diaper pail is a must in the nursery.  There are just too many diapers to not have one and an open garbage can or even a regular one is just too stinky.  This one has a lid that closes nicely to shut out odors.  It has a nice little compartment for odor disks to help manage odor.  It can be a bit of a hassle to empty and reload, but it only needs changing about every two days and since it fits regular kitchen bags, it is worth the money.  It isn't very expensive to begin with.
Bought this to keep my toddler from unplugging some important plugs (ie: tv, chest freezer, etc) It works very well and is extremely secure. I actually have a very tough time getting into this. The narrowness makes this not work for adapters or thick cords. And the two small openings at the bottom of the unit are for thinner or normal sized cords only. I had a hard time getting my thicker cords through (the surge protector and chest freezer cord). I actually broke the bottom section that separates for two cords off so the larger cords would go in more easily. When I did this I was actually only able to put one cord per cover. Recommend this just for thin plugs, no adapters. Good buy for the price.
My little guy is very active and loves to get into trouble. We only have a couple items plugged into an outlet that isn't covered by furniture so I purchased these to make sure he couldn't pull the plug out of the wall and get shocked. They are wonderful and I feel much safer letting my little guy explore the house. Even though I am never too far away our let him out of sight he still manages to get into things. He is so fast and just a little distraction could be fatal. But I don't have to worry about the plugs anymore! One less worry and just the little bit of stress relief that makes this purchase very easy for me to recommend it to all parents.
Unfortunately you cannot tell from the picture, but this product is not well designed. It projects far out from the wall, and cannot accommodate any plugs larger than a two prong (meaning non grounded) table lamp cord. Anything like a power strip, laptop cord, etc, will not even be able to be plugged in because the casing blocks it. In addition, the slot to feed the cord through to exit the device is also very small and fits almost none of the electronics in my house. It also sits on top of the outlet cover, so there is no way to really secure it tightly and it can rotate a bit.
These are fine for standard, thin power cords.  We have had one in place that the kids have never dislodged despite two years of trying.  But they will not close over the heavy, thick cords like those for microwaves, computers, or power bars.  We finally ended up attaching ours to the wall with duct tape to cover those cords.I am giving this three stars because it does work fairly well for thin cords, and because I have yet to see anything better out there.  My advice?  Invest in duct tape.
This things install quickly and easily if you're running standard cords (for lamps, etc.) though the holes.  If you want to run something thicker (like the wire on one of my power strips) I found I had to do a bit of modification to make it fit.  I ended up trimming the gap so it was larger on the backside plate and that did the trick.I think the ones I got are more than difficult enough to keep my son from opening them.  I'd consider them on the fence for an outlet that I'd want access to all the time, and someone with arthritis would probably want to stay away.
I had a couple major issues with this outlet cover.#1: The screw that probably is in your existing wall outlet covers is not long enough to accommodate this outlet cover. They made it much thicker than the outlet cover it replaces so for me, I need to go purchase a handful of screws.#2: Box is not big enough to accommodate ANYTHING except basic, small, two-prong plugs. So what won't fit? Our laptops, our phone charger (Samsung Galaxy has a small box that plugs into wall), iPod chargers, computer charger, power strip plug, light dimming plug attached to lamp, DSLR charger, baby sound machine, Verizon Fios plugs. Well crap... what appliance plugs DID fit, you ask? A lamp. Just one lamp. Oh, and the electric toothbrushes.Useless, sending them back. The Safety 1st units are square (not pyramid shaped) and hold various plugs.
These are designed to cover plugs you leave plugged in, such as lamps or alarm clocks, so keep kids from pulling on the plugs/cords and damaging them or injuring themselves.  And that's exactly what they do.  We use several in our home and have had no problems.  They're also very easy to install with a simple screwdriver.Many of the negative reviews here complain either it is too hard to open (which is completely the point) or that it only holds "small" (aka standard) plugs, which should be obvious from the description and picture, so they're not really being fair.
These were a complete hassle to pry apart just to install them.  My mom and I each held a side and pulled, but nothing.  I finally had to shove in the latches as far as I could to get them apart.  Since that seems to be the only way to take the cover off, I had to leave the latches pushed in, defeating the purpose of keeping kids from pulling them off.  Definitley something I would use as a permanent fixture.  It's too much of a hassle to take it off every time you need to plug something in.  I plugged in what I needed to and have not intention of switching them up.
I tried to use this power strip cover for about 2 months when our twin daughters were 8-10 months old. It was frustrating for my husband & I -- hard to get the power strip inside, hard to keep things plugged in, and too big to hide out of the babies view (not to mention that it's bulky and a bit ugly). For the babies, it became yet another interesting thing around the house that we had to wrestle from their hands. They were able to unplug the cords easily and were starting to reach their fingers into the top hole when I finally gave up on using it. Yes, the cover did keep the babies from actually touching the outlets in the power strip, but I could have accomplished the same thing with a couple of normal outlet covers.In the end, I rearranged our cords making the power strip & this cover unnecessary. It was just too annoying to keep using the cover.
I ordered this some time ago. I finally started using it last week. It was very difficult to figure out how to use. But, once I ready the instructions a few times I got it.  My 8 month old loves all electric cords. I needed something to protect her. For the past week this has been working.Only one side of it can I get a big 3 prong plug into it. I only need 2 openings to get in and out of so it hasn't presented itself as a major problem yet. I would purchase another one of these.
This is a perfect baby proofing tool.  The strip cover will cover most standard sized power strips.  There is a hole on the side for the power strip to plug into the outlet and a wide opening on top for it to connect to the devices plugged into it.  It is really easy to put together- just snap shut in 3 places.  It is also easy to adjust as there is a button on the side that allows you to slide it between different sizes.  Overall, best power strip cover I've seen.
Really? How could this possibly be useful? I saw somebody else post that the baby's hand can fit inside and I thought they were exaggerating. Really, I can reach my fingers in easily or poke a metal object through even easier. The baby's whole hand fits through the giant gap. Plus the thing is huge. Like almost as big as a shoe box. And really ugly. I don't know what we'll replace it with since the others don't sound better, but I know there is no point in decorating my living room with baby proofing for show. There's no way I could leave baby in there with this while I was out of the room, so I might as well just leave the cords as is.
It's funny how many people have positively reviewed this. Yes, it's very convenient, easy to use, and fits well. What it doesn't actually do is effectively COVER the plugs! It's trivial for a small child to fit their entire hand in the rather large opening. In fact, I just plugged something in without having to remove the cover. If I can fit my hand in there, so can a child. And it doesn't even begin to protect against a child sticking a metal object in there. This product is, in a word, worthless.I recommend getting one of the power strips that has sliding covers on each of the individual outlets, or simply placing standard child-proof covers on the outlets of your existing power strip. But please don't use this product and think you are adequately protecting your child from shocks.
I bought and returned the other popular brand of power strip cover because it doesn't fit iPhone/iMac chargers.  This one does.  And it adjusts lengthwise so you can make it pretty long if you need it to.  Some other reviews mention the size of the opening on the top - it's true, it's surprisingly wide, I can usually reach in enough to pull out a plug when I need to, rather than opening the whole thing.  So could your kid conceivably pull one of your plugs out when you don't want him/her to?  Sure, but the cover is also tall enough that it would be pretty darn hard for them to stick their fingers down into the open sockets.  Bottom line: treat this as a deterrent and not a substitute for knowing when your kid's playing with power cords.
I have two very busy almost two year old twins who were fascinated with the power strip in their playroom. This cover isn't the most attractive thing, but works. They cannot reach into it or access anything, (not sure what hole people are talking about), and have left it alone.  It's about the size of a one liter soda bottle, and slides together/apart to extend the length. It is tall enough, but not quite long enough to secure together firmly on our extra long power strip. It still works however, and is the best solution I've found. Would recommend.
This works pretty well to keep little hands from grabbing power strips. It also has the option of hanging it on the wall which I really like. The things I was not happy about was the quality of the plastic seems flimsy and also if you have to hook it on the last hole due to the size of your power strip it barely stays together. For our longest strip we had to duct tape around the entire device to make sure it stays together. Other than that it's a decent little contraption that does its job.
This cover works well for my power strips -- all the ones in my house fit. Also, I like that it doesn't matter how big the plugs are that you have in the power strip, it holds them (those large converter plugs that won't fit is so many child proof products fit fine in this one.My child is 10 months and hasn't messed with these yet, so I can't say how they will hold up with a larger toddler. However, I was concerned she'd try to put her hand in the slot that cords come out of and that hasn't happened yet. You still have to manage how the cords coming out of this cover are child-proofed. There is some space to roll up excess slack and stuff it into the cover.
Many kids have been able to remove safety devices in less than 30 seconds.  It takes less than 5 minutes for a parent to leave the room to get something and return to find their child hanging from the cords...DEAD!!!  It is safer to spend the money and go CORDLESS!!!  But if you must keep your corded blinds, get the Fashion Wand (approved by PFWBS).  Go to Parents for Window Blind Safety (PFWBS) website and read all the testimonials of kids who died or were severely injured by blind cords.  Watch the videos they have of kids bypassing or breaking safety devices on cords in less than 30 seconds.  And then decide if you want to install a safety kit or remove the danger altogether.
There is no perfect solution to window blind cords, but I think these do well. I actually used this kind years ago for pets. I do usually have to open and close them to unwind, but that is okay. What is important is that they put the cord high above a child's reach. I just ordered many more for the rest of the windows. However, for the kid's room we have the kind that is screwed into to the wall and wraps the cord around, so there is no chance of these plastic parts falling.
We have busy almost-two year old twins who are fascinated with the many window blinds in our house. I didn't want to spend a fortune, but needed a quick fix. These did the trick, easy to install, and keep the cords just out of their reach. They do pop off from time to time, but are easily replaced. I've purchased several different brands, and they are all about the same. I wouldn't spend extra money on ones that claim to do better than this type.
Although the design of these is to wind the cord shorter, when a window is open and blinds are drawn the cord does get longer. I left a room for 30 seconds and came back to see that my son had pulled the cord down and had it wrapped around his neck. Terrifying. Although these do pop open easily, they most definitely did not pop open from the pressure of a child's neck which I find to be a SERIOUS design flaw. From a company named Safety 1st - back to the drawing board on these!
It's pretty hard to find a great oven lock.  This one had terrible reviews, but was the kind we needed for our new oven (a side lock).  We've been using it for 9 months, and my toddler (who is now almost 2) seems quite safe.  She's pulled on the handle of the oven a few times (and we've told her "no", which she seems to accept most of the time) and the lock has stayed put.  She's tried to operate the lock a few times, and has not been successful at that either.  I can see a toddler who is very interested in the lock being able to figure it out, but she has been easily diverted from it.It's held up great, and I don't find it too cumbersome to lock/unlock it whenever I use the oven (which is pretty often - I cook a lot). I have no complaints.
These locks just cannot be beat.  They were featured on HGTV to baby-proof your house which is how I found out about them in the first place.  They cannot be opened at ALL by the child, unlike many of the other items out there.  You have to not only have the key to open the door, you have to know how to manipulate it to open.  If you have chemicals that you have store within a child's reach, there is no other better way than this lock to make SURE that child is safe.  I feel very blessed that I found out these locks exist because my little one is extremely curious and figures out EVERYTHING! Trust me, you won't be disappointed.  Regarding the installation, my husband is not a handyman - he's a musician and if he can figure it out, so can just about anyone else.  Buy them!
We have these locks installed on our cabinets in our home. I've tried other brands without success.. my kids always figure a way to get in. With this system, they can try all they want but they cannot get in. Sometimes the doors require pressing to open, but after I figured it out.. I never have an issue opening the doors. This will be the system of choice in any additional homes we buy later on... I don't think I'd ever want to change after having such a positive experience. I would definitely recommend this to a friend or family member, without hesitation!
This product is great.  It's not super easy to install (each lock requires 6 screws plus one hole in the door).  If you take your time, ready the instructions, plan it out, and execute; it works great.  You have to be patient.  Each door took me 5 to 10 minutes.  In less than 1 hour I was able to unpack, read instructions, plan, get my tools, and have it done in 4 doors.  I think it won't work with hollow doors or maybe doors that are too thick but mine were pretty standard.I love how it's hidden and pretty sturdy due to having a bunch of screws holding it.  The adhesive ones are easy to install but I bet my son would open them in no time.
After many years of fighting traditional cheap plastic child safety locks (we have a cat that likes to get into things too) and seeing our son still manage to pinch his fingers in doors (better than getting at chemicals or whatever, but still!), our pediatrician recommended these to us.  They were easy to install, and he can't get the doors open at all, so no pinched fingers or getting at something he shouldn't.  They also have a mechanism to keep the lock in the open position, like if you need to get in a cabinet a lot, or the kids are older and you don't need them anymore.  I would however recommend keeping an extra key around in case one gets lost, or locked in a cabinet by accident.
This is simply a great product.  It is installed inside the cabinet so there is nothing to see from the front.  The newer models work even easier than the original ones we purchased years ago.  They open easily when the magnet is put near (don't even need to touch the cabinet door).  We use these in several places over the house and love the convenience, but piece of mind it gives.  They are also pretty strong - our 3 1/2 year old pulls and tries to open sometimes and has not broken or pulled open any drawer.NOTE - The old version needed a drill to make a small hole on the lock which sits inside the door, but the newer ones like this no longer require that hole to be made. These work better and are easier to install - just need a screwdriver and a few minutes.
This was a product that I used when I worked in child care and I always liked the fact that it is &#34;invisible&#34; and is not an obvious eye-sore on your cabinets. But when I tried to install on my sink cabinet, one side worked like a charm and the other side just won't work. I can find no discernible reason for this and it is very frustrating. The two parts line up fine, but they won't latch. And the two cabinet sides were installed what seems like identically to me, but apparently not. In my opinion, it shouldn't be this difficult to make accurate measurements to ensure that the product will work. It might just be my cabinets, but they are not anything crazy or out of the ordinary. I am frustrated that I will have to drill more holes into my cabinet and there is no guarantee that it will work!
This product is a great concept, BUT it has a critical flaw for me.  The whole idea that I need to drill a big hole inside each cabinet door or drawer is a non starter.  I mean, why would you spend money on a nice kitchen only to drill holes inside doors and drawers?  Hello?  Baby will grow up eventually so the locks are not needed.  What about those holes?  It is cute that the manual says "do not drill through the door," hugh?  Why would I want to even have a drill near my cabinet doors?  Also, what happens if say the door cracks while I drill?  Who pays for that?  I know the answer to that one -> ME!  Soooo....product is going back.  Non-starter
I am opening a home daycare and these are some of the only locks that are approved by the state of Washington. I really like the fact that they can be unlocked for long periods of time, so when I am working in the kitchen I can leave them unlocked and then quickly lock them again. They are really not hard to install, I watched a video on You Tube that showed how to install them and then went and did it.I am going to recommend these to people I know. I really think they would be great for grandparents or anyone who has young kids visiting often because you can turn them off when the kids are not there, most other child locks do not have that feature.
I really love this set of clippers. After trying many different brands and styles - this is the one that we love. The blades are dull enough that they do not clip skin but sharp enough to cut sharp little nails. My baby's grow quickly so these clippers are used often. I like that the grip it small enough to fit in my hand easily but not too big to make me clumsy.I love the grip, that it moves with me and keeps me stable so that I only clip nails. It will not work for big people nails, which is nice - it means I can always find it when I need!I highly recommend these clippers to caregivers of infants and toddlers. Hands down my favorite clippers - perfect on the pocketbook too!
I received a different nail clipper as a baby shower gift. It had a plastic cover over the top of the cutting end of the clipper, similar to this one, but with a plain white handle instead of the cute bumble bee:Sassy: Bumble Bee Nail Clippers. It was terrible. I couldn't see my baby's finger nails at all and it wasn't sharp enough.Then I used this Safety 1st Nail Clipper at my mother's house. It was so much easier to use than the other one. The size is perfect for her little fingers. I could easily see my baby's nails and clip them without fear of cutting her. The handle fits nicely in my hand. And the blade is sharp enough to cut the nail off in one clip. I bought one for myself and it's the only one I'll use now.
We had the Summer Infant clippers first.  They came in a two-pack, with a smaller clipper and a larger clipper.  Neither one worked well.  The larger of the two didn't work at all.  These Safety First clippers cut every time.  For those of you who know how difficult it can be to clip a baby's nails, you also know how frustrating it can be to finally get the clipper positioned right and then have it not cut.  AAAAARRRRGGGHHHH!These work every time.
This is baby nail clipper #4 that we've tried, and our search is finally over.  It's sharp enough to cut nails on the first try and the white bulb is pretty comfortable to hold.  What more do you need in a pair of baby nail clippers?The losers:- Safety 1st model 49539 (has the holder for emery boards) - the grip is comfortable but the clippers are blunt and therefore useless.  The emery board is useful.- Dubon baby nail clipper (the kind that you wear on your finger like a ring) - has the safety guard so you don't catch the baby's skin in the clippers, but that makes it almost impossible to clip the actual nail.  Plus, it's not sharp and therefore worthless.- Nuby infant nail clipper - not bad in terms of sharpness, but something about the way it's designed makes it really difficult to get at the baby's nails.Search ends here, thank goodness!
These nail clippers are dangerous and I threw them out a long time ago.  I tried to trim my 3 month old son's nails, granted he is the fidgeting type.  Just as I was about to clip one of his nails, he jerked his hand and I accidentally cut off the tip of his finger.  His finger bled, my son cried and I panicked.  Thankfully it was a shallow wound which healed quickly and did not do any serious damage.  But if I knew how dangerous these clippers were I would never have used them in the first place.Instead I use baby nail scissors by same company.  They are VERY safe.  I have used them for over a year and have never had any accidents.  I shudder to think of using nail clippers again, especially now that I have to chase my son around the room to cut his nails.
I know that every doctor says an oral temperature doesn't count, you have to take a rectal one.  But seriously, I hate taking my sons rectal temperature.  It is gross, he is squirming around.  Yuck.  This is so much easier. You pop it in their mouth, couple of seconds later, you have your temperature.  I have found it to be really accurate, unlike the ear one, which reads completely different on each ear.  Plus it is so small I bought a second one for our diaper bag.  Super convenient!
When I bought this item, I thought this was a really clever way to take a baby's temperature.  I use this thermometer only on occasion.  It's convenient, but it requires about 3 minutes before a final temperature is reached.  It requires that your baby keep it in his mouth for that long.  It's getting harder for my baby to accept this "pacifier", now that she is on the larger, 6-month-plus sized pacifiers.  Also, check with your doctor about how to take accurate readings: our pediatrician said that a rectal thermometer was the most accurate for the early weeks of her life.
My baby is two years old now and he loves his pacifiers. I bought this when I was pregnant because I thought it would be a brilliant way to measure a babys temperature but I was wrong... As a new mom I was wrong about a number of things... this was one of them. No baby is going to keep a pacifier in his mouth long enough to actually get the temperature measured if it is not his (her) pacifier that he (she) loves and always uses. Any baby will identify this as a strange object and spit it out immediately, its too heavy. Especially if the baby is not feeling well. Don't buy this. Get a real thermometer.
My Grandmother got this tub for my 3 month old son to use while visiting. It isn't as spacious as the tub we use at home, which is a little smaller than most tubs, but it folds up nicely, and it feels very safe and sturdy-not flimsy at all. I use both tubs in the big bathtub, so leaking isn't a problem for me. My son seems comfortable, but he prefers to have more water to splash in than this one holds. This tub is great for grandma's house, or if space is tight.
I am sorry I bought this tub.  It is very uncomfortable for my daughter.  Used it since she was about 3 weeks old.  I have to place a towel behind her head b/c the hard plastic is at such a sharp angle it's uncomfortable.  Also, there is a part where she got her foot stuck and she screamed with pain!  It's way too small.  She's now 4.5 mos and I'm throwing it away b/c she is practically flipping out of it.  And the plug is waaaaay too hard to plug -  it's an enormous effort to plug it each time.I've switched to the First Years infant to toddler tub and it is way bigger, nicer, more comfortable, and it has no areas to pinch fingers or toes.
This tub has proven very handy.  My son got his first bath in it at only 3 days old.  I admit, that was a little tricky.  However, in no time we had it down and I was able to bathe him easily anywhere.  Usually we take the bath on his bedroom floor.  I like the portability and the fact that it can fold up and fit under the bathroom counter, since his bathroom is also the guest bathroom.  I also like the little section in the front.  That's where I put the soapy water.  It's easy to rinse him off with a little watering can.  The tub has been great, but now that my son is 17 lbs. it's getting small.  I will be looking for another bath aid soon, but I'll miss this handy tub.
I bought this tub before my son was born, thinking it looked great and I could use it in the kitchen sink.  I do like that I can use it in the sink, but he's not a super long baby and his little feet always get stuck in the grooves where the tub folds!  It doesn't hold much water, either.  I wish I had read reviews before I bought it, because now, after only 2 months, I'm just going to replace it and throw it away.  What a waste!
I have been using this tub since my sons very first bath. At first he hated to take a bath and now he loves it. I love the fact that it folds up very easily and will fit into a closet when folded. I have never had a problem with it growing mold or smelling musty. After the bath I wipe it dry with a towel fold it up and put it in the closet. I also have a newborn to toddler tub, which is very large and I have nowhere to store it.I have never had a problem with it leaking. As long as you don't overfill it, it works just fine. I find this tub to be better than the more expensive ones. The only problem I have is that my six month old son is too big for this tub, but at $12.99, is that really such a big deal? I feel I got my moneys worth out of it. If you are looking for a tub that is safe and easy to store I recommend this one.
If you are really, really, REALLY hard pressed for space, then maybe this tub is for you... except that you'll only use it for 3 months  because it is so small and then it will sit in storage wasting that valuable space.  As with most tubs, this holds maybe a quart of water, which means, only babies bum is wet, how fun is that.  And as soon as baby can sit, that is if she hasn't outgrown this small tub by then, she will not want to lay down at the angle this tub puts her at.  Save space by getting a little bigger tub that will spend more time holding your splashing baby than sitting under your sink: I have the Newborn to Toddler Tub by The First Years--my baby is a year old and I still use it (she is petite, but I'm sure anyone can get at least 6-9 months out of it.)
I used this tub after borrowing from a friend because our Four Stage Bath System was so bad it was cutting up my baby's legs.  This was okay - soft all over, no problems like we had with the four stage, however because it folds the hinges tend to leak.  Also, you can't fill it to the level you would want because of the way its reclined.  The back is still very slippery despite the nonslip matt.  We only used for a few weeks before just bringing her in the tub with Mom and washing her that way.
My mom got this tub for my daughter right after she was born.  We have used it since she was able to take a bath, and she's 4 months old.  I liked that it could be folded, but I never actually put it away unless we have company since I use it daily.  It does leak at the hinges.  My daughter is very comfortable in it.  Since she was born in the winter, I gave her a bath in the bathroom so that I could get it really warm.  It does fit in the kitchen sink though.  I still give her her bath in the bathroom, and just sit her tub in the big tub.  It uses less water, her head is elevated, and she's a little higher.  She hasn't outgrown it yet, and has plenty of room. It is a great tub, and a great price!
I got this as a shower gift. The first time I used the tub my baby kept slipping around in the tub. She wound up sideways in it during the entire bath and I never used it again. I would just as soon put her into the bathtub and put a couple of inches of water into the tub and bathe my baby that way rather than put her into this contraption. I am a RN and quite used to giving baths in different settings so it is not inexperience talking here. I currently put her on the safer bather (read my review) or put her in the tub alone. Baby loves bathtime and is 6 months old.Lets just say that this tub is downstairs with the rest of the lawnsale stuff for this year.....
I used this tub with my 1st son almost 4 years ago and now I bought a new one for my 2nd son born this year.  Living in an apartment, this tub is great for small spaces.  I use it in the big tub and when I am done, I just rinse it and leave it to dry.  When dried, I fold it and put it in the cabinet.  The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because I had to buy a sponge to use on top of this in order to keep my son from slipping.  But considering it folds for storage, that was not a big issue.  It's a great tub otherwise.
I bought this tub without doing any research on it. I bought it because I liked the idea of it growing with my baby. Well, I got it together all right but it is WAY too big for the bathroom and/or kitchen sink so I had to put it in the big tub from the very beginning. Also, I have yet to get it to shrink, so I have this huge tub in the bathroom all the time. The sling seemed to work all right when my son was smaller, but now he is 4 months and he loves to kick. However, that causes him to slide down the sling and it's quite hard where the sling ends, so he ends up with this red mark on his lower back. Also, it just doesn't seem to hold water. I have read the directions and everything but the water just leaks out. All in all, I will give this tub another chance once my son gets older and can sit up but if it still leaks, I am getting another one.
I had ordered a different tub for my shower but never received it.  I had my baby so I picked up this tub last week.  However I could not figure out how to use the sling alone for my 1 week old infant.  It appears that you have to hold her head up while in the sling which leaves you with only 1 hand to bathe her with.  But anyone with an infant knows that they kick and squirm and I found it very hard to use.  I tried to snap it into the tub for the 2nd stage (thinking better support) and I could not get it to fit!Much easier to sponge bathe a new baby on a contoured changing pad.  I'm thinking of returning and going for the EuroTub.
I'm shocked by all of the other reviews on this particular product.  Many complain that it's too small for their sink...hello!!!  It wasn't made for a SINK.  Anyway,...I love this tub.  I wouldn't want any other one.  It was the most convenient when my son needed to be on the sling =perfect=, and now that he's sitting up,... it's even more convenient.  Please ignore the negative reviews and I highly consider buying this product.  It may be the only tub you will buy in you child' early stages.
I haven't had problems with this tub.... I used another tub for my son for the first 3 months, and that tub became too small, so I purchased this one.  I'm so glad I did.At 3 months, my son was large for his age, but unable to sit up yet, so this tub was perfect.I've given it 4 stars instead of 5 because I agree with the other comments that it is not easily collapsible to store, and it is bulky, but we simply let it dry in the bathroom overnight and store it under his crib during the day - so space turned out to not be so much of a problem.I have had no issues with the tub leaking though.  Once it is completely extended, there is a good seal and it does not leak.I have and will continue to recommend this tub to all my friends.It's accomodating for longer than any tub out there.well worth the money.
I looked everywhere for a tub without all the grooves for baby's body - I wanted something that would submerge nicely from the neck down and this looked like it would do the trick. Unfortunately, it doesn't hold any water to submerge anything than perhaps the feet. Leaks horribly, bulky - we gave up, returned it, and now we just bath with baby. Nothing works better than you own hands on your slippery baby anyway, and you can avoid sore knees from bathroom tile and stiff back from bending over the tub.
We've only used this tub a handful of times because our son is only 3 weeks old. I have not had any problems with the tub leaking. But like I said, we've only used it a handful of times. I definately don't think this tub is appropriate for small babies. The tub has absolutely no support for his head OR his body. It takes my husband AND I to bathe him b/c the tub offers no help. It would be just as easy to put him in our full size bath tub. I wouldn't recommend this tub for small babies.
We love this tub.  We have been using it since our daughter's first bath.  It was tough to pop the tub into the expanded version, but that tight fit means it won't leak.  If you don't pop it together right it will leak.  We leave it set up in the tub when not in use so it's not really taking up any vital space.  Our daughter seems to like the sling.  She's four months old now and didn't cry even during her first bath.3/06 - We're now using this tub on child #2.  Still no problems.  This child likes it too.  Between the two girls we've been using this tub for 22 mo.  It has never leaked, not once.
Being the excited new mom I opened this to get a feel for it and see how it would fit in our home and almost cut my finger sliding it open! I was shocked and then thought if I have not even used it and it does this I do not want! Plus if it did this to me then what about when I am washing my child. And I read all the instructions before attempting to play with it so I could do it correctly. Right back in the box and I drove back to the store the same day....got another brand....
I wrote a review a few months ago but I have to edit it. I followed all the directions, I was very careful and patient with this tub, I washed it and dried it after each use and still I find things growing in the crevices and between the top and bottom. The design idea was good but it just isn't practical for a baby tub that will need to be used regularly. The sling slips out of place all the time and the bath ring isn't worth the extra work it takes to clean it and the little ridges that hold it into the tub. No matter how hard I work it's impossible to keep this tub clean.
I registered for this tub because I thought it is very cool and so multi-functional.After the baby was born and passed his stage of dry bath, I found this tub is not very easy to use.  My husband and I coudln't solve the leaking issue.  It also difficult for me to expand or close the tub.The sling is not very good, either.I tried to use this tub for 3 times and returned it.  I got Sure Comfort Deluxe instead.  I think Sure Comfort Deluxe is a much better choice for new born.  It is very easy to put over my sink.  The green net comes with the tub is easy to use.
Unfortunately, I am not able to find this bathtub anywhere (( My son used to have it 6-7 years ago). It is great! It is the only one bathtub where a baby does not slip forward and doesn't go under water. This blue gear is awesome. I do not understand why it is discontinued. I do not care if it is leaking. I did not notice that because it was used in adult bathtub. IF SOMEBODY HAS IT, PLEASE, I WILL BUY FROM YOU.
It's been 5 months aleady and we've had no troubles at all.  It leaked the first time we used it because I didn't snap the locks into place all the way. My boys are quite big for their age, and they love to kick their legs and splash around. There is plenty of room for that.  In the beginning I put the tub on my bathroom counter, but when they started splashing water all over the place, I put this tub in our regular bath. I don't use the sling anymore, but it wasn't a problem when we did.
I registered for this bath tub and recieved it as a shower gift. Everything on the tub works well. My son does slide down the sling and I do have to put him back. But I don't think it's possible for that not to happen because he's so actively moving the whole time. I've never had a problem with it leaking. The suction cups do get stuck on very hard and I really have to pull to get it up so much that I pulled one suction cup off last time(It went back on very easily). But theres a reason they stick so much to keep my son safe. So I am glad to have this tub and would recommend it over all the others.
I pressed and clicked the correct spot like it said in the directions and yet it still leaks. This was a problem because i used it on the kitchen counters for the first week. I had to put towels under it to absorb all the water. So i moved it upstairs to the bathtub and this way i don't have to worry about all the leaks. Really, who wants a tub that leaks???? My daughter is not yet sitting up on her own and yet she is too long to be reclined comfortably in this tub....so we are in an awkward transition phase. a phase that this tub doesn't suitably deal with. I wouldn't buy this tub.
It leaks every time I use it. It's impossible to snap back together if by some miracle you can change the size.  I have to put towels underneath the tub to collect all the water that leaks out of it.  I love the sling, but I am tempted to beat the tub with a hammer just to take out my frustrations with it.  If I could get down on the floor and bathe my son in the big tub with this tub inside, it would probably be easier (but I don't think my knees would appreciate it.  I received this as a gift and didn't check the reviews before using, I should have.  I am currently looking for another solution to this piece of junk.  Buy at your own risk.
this tub leaks - i had to put it in my bath tub to use it, which really hurt my back and made me nervous when taking my daughter out of the tub and trying to stand up.  couldnt use it on a kitchen counter unless i wanted everything to get wet.doesnt open and close very easily -  i gave myself more than one bruise (due to pinched skin) when trying to open and close it.  also, by the time your child can sit up in this might as well put them in the big tub..my daughter slipped and slid all over when we tried to sit her up.too short - by the time she was 4 months, she was too long for this tub and would kick the sides.i had regisered for the eurotub, but rec'd this.  preferred the euortub by far!
My mom bought this for us after she decided that the bath chair we already owned was not good enough.  This has been the best bathtub we could have ever wanted!  The newborn sling is nice, and lets baby have contact with the water without feeling overwhelmed.  Our baby didn't really like bath time until he could sit up by himself, and at that point this bath tub became a necessity.  Baby loves to explore the tub, and the secure bath ring helps keep him safely and securely in one place.  He is now almost 20 mos and we still use it with the bath ring in place because he likes it better that way, too!  I especially like it because I don't have to worry about him slipping under the water accidentally if I look away for a second to get his towel ready or something.  We had a problem with leaking at first, too, but once we read the instructions and pushed the bottom down securely, we haven't had a problem since.
Great product for our little one.  We put the baby tub in the big bath tub and our little one loves to take baths.  The first time we used it I had a hard time locking it but once I got it locked there were no problems.  I like the whole set up especially teh suction cups so it doesnt slide around, the sling to keep the baby laying on an incline is great too the perfect height to keep the baby happy.  It also has a removable bath ring, that she will be using when she can sit on her own.
Not sure why this got bad reviews.  There is a slight issue with locking the tub in the expanded position, if you don't snap it in right, it will leak.  But once we figured that out we had no problems.  We used the product starting at about 8 weeks when our son outgrew the sink but was too tiny for the tub and we stuck this tub right on our countertop for months with no problem.  Now we use it in our regular tub and it saves us from having to waste a tubful of water for one tiny person to bathe.  Our son is now almost one and he still loves this tub, great value!
I was so excited when I recieved this tub thinking it would last for years. Well, first you can NOT use it in your home bathtub, because the suction cups will not adhere to a non-slip surface. Most tubs are non-slip, that's what the little bumps are for in your tub. This was fine though, I planned to use it on our kitchen counter. No matter how hard I pressed on the middle "locking" device water always leaked out onto the counter and floor. This tub is more trouble than it's worth!
I received this tub as a gift at my baby shower.  I looked at it and thought what a great idea for a tub.  Wrong!!  First of all, the tub leaks.  You cannot let go of the baby for one second beacause they will slide.  My son absolutely hated bath time until I bought the seat that sits in the bath tub and now he is happy.  The sides of the ramp are hard and if they move there head to quickly they could hurt themselves.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
i was surprised to read all those negative reviews regarding this tub.  i had two different tubs before, and i got this one when my daughter was 5 months old, she's now one year old and still uses it.  granted, i never tried to fold it since those few inches don't seem to make much of a difference storagewise, so i don't know if its difficult to do.  i've had absolutetly no leaks with this tub, and the suction cups still work great.  the bathring works great, and can be moved out of the way when baby is old enough to sit alone.  although i still use the bathring so my daughter cant stand up all the time.  it's been 7  months with this tub, and nothing ever broke, or got worn.  i think this tub is great!!!
We registered for this tub, before doing any research.  Big mistake.  As a newborn, I used the sling to bathe my son.  As he got bigger, I put the sling into the tub (2nd way of the 4-1 system).  Bath time became a pain.  My son kept sliding down, even with one hand on him at all times.  He didn't really seem to enjoy it either.  Finally, after reading great online reviews I bought the Eurobath.  LOVE IT!!!!!  From day one my son had a great time in his new (huge) tub.  He fits securely into the reclined side of the tub, with no slipping.  He is comfortable and there is enough water around him to keep him warm and for him to splash.  We've had it over a month, I highly recommend the Eurobath over this bath tub.
This is the most poorly made baby bath I have ever used. It is impossible to get folded and unfolded. When you do get that figured out then you get to deal with the stupid sling. My baby kept slipping down and her ears would get under water. She is now to big for the sling, but to small to sit up in the ring. I gave it a fair try, but I had to go out and buy another bath. It seems like a great concept, but it is really just a waste of [money].
this is the worst bath tub i've bought. i returned this item right away. it leaks. once i pulled it out to be longer but, no matter how much i struggled to put the extension back together, it just wouldn't click. when i pressed it to lock the extension, i couldn't tell whether it locked or not, so then i put water to test the lock system. the result was that my kitchen counter and floor were a mess.now, i bought the Euro bath. it does a good job.
We bought 2 of these, and used them to block off the computer desk from the rest of the family room, and to block off the 7' wide archway between the kitchen and the rest of the house. We soon found that while these are very sturdy and adaptable, they are tall enough that they are a hassle to step over. At least once a week, my husband or I will catch a toe or scrape a shin stepping over. So if you intend to use this fence as a corral, either indoors or out, this is a Great Buy. If you are planning to use it as a fence to block off a wide opening, pay the extra money for the metal version with the gate. you (and your toes) will be much happier.
When our son started rolling into chairs, we knew we needed something to keep him safe.  This play yard fits great in our living room, yet there's plenty of room for him to roll around in all directions.  Also, I like that it's see-thru.  You can see  your baby (and he can see you) from across the room.  I don't care that it's not the most attractive thing.  It was affordable and it does the job.  And when our son starts crawling, we can completely close it and know that he won't be able to sneak off.  One suggestion I would make to the manufacturer though would be to pad or provide padding around the bottom, about six inches high.  My son falls asleep with his head on the edge all the time (NOT very comfortable), and when I move him away from it, he wakes up.  It'd be nice to not have to move him.
This product is a godsend!  I use it on a carpeted area for our 7 month old infant, so she can crawl around to her hearts content and be safe from wall outlets, small objects, etc.  I am also planning on getting an extension, to make her play area even bigger.  The 'Superyard XT' is also great for puppies, and more humane than crating them for hours.  My only complaint, and it is minor, is that the gate that opens (so you can get in the 'Superyard') is awkward and somewhat difficult to work.  There should be an easier swing open type gate on this thing, so that mommy or daddy can quickly enter and leave the play area.
This is one of only a few products my husband and I would buy again with no hesitation.  We bought it over a year ago (with the extension) and have used it every day since.  When my daughter outgrew the octoganal arrangement, we just opened it up and have used it to block her from the kitchen and other dangerous areas.  She is not a climber yet, so I do NOT recommend using it in this fashion if your child is.  It will tip over, the circular formation is the sturdiest.  We haven't had any problems with pieces breaking off or the plastic being brittle and we adjust it almost daily.  Highly recommended.
This is a stay-at-home mom's lifesaver!As my little boy (now 9 months) has become moremobile, this product has helped tremendously.It has broadened his world but in an enclosed space.We keep his play yard in a corner within the superyard, in the children's playroom.He never gets tired of it. He can play with his toys,while I check my email, do the laundry and watch him at the same time. He loves it!He can crawl or cruise within his area and can see me whilehe plays. It's great that you can adjust the individual pieces.I recommend buying the extra parts to have a larger space for baby to roam in. It never hurts to have extra, in case one breaks. Great product! We have great fun playing in it together!
We got the superyard (or, as I call it, the &quot;Steel Cage Death Match&quot; yard) to contain our child in the living room and den while we are working. This is our experience. Your mileage may vary.Plus side: The fence itself is robust and basically indestructable. In it's four or five sided form, it's very stable, even against toddler rage! (&quot;Attica, Attica!&quot;) The sides can be taken apart, to make smaller areas.Minus side: the folding and locking mechanism is very stiff, and I was afraid I was breaking it at first when I was opening it up. So far it's not too much of a problem. The whole system is pretty heavy, and not nearly as portable as they try to tell you. Also, it's pretty clunky and large, so once it's up, we keep it up. The major downside is the price. Ack.
I got this from a friend whose son had outgrown it. It has been wonderful. We use it both indoors and out. Outdoors it's good for keeping and busy infant or toddler in one place so you can do yard work or relax without having to chase them around. It is especially handy in the backyard since we have a pool. I just put a few toys inside it with my son and he's happy for a while. We don't have a playpen so we use this inside as well when we need to make sure he stays out of harms way for a few minutes. We even use it for the dog when she sleeps inside at night because otherwise she chews on everything in the house while we're sleeping. It folds easily and stores great under the bed.
I was initially given this product as a gift for my 9 pound chihuahua. It's great in the sense that it contains him very well. He is very active and likes to jump very high, but he can not jump over the gate. He tries to push the gate in attempt to escape but the gate does not move. The gate is high enough so that he can not jump over. It contains his crate, wee-wee pad and food bowl with plenty of room for him to play around in. I bought a second one to use as a gate to keep him from going up our stairs. Very sturdy product and we plan on using this also when we have kids. One drawback is the gate is a little difficult to open at times in case you want to just walk in. But I guess that is the good thing also so who ever you have inside can't get out.
I recommend getting the extension that goes with this gate to make it big enough.  Our baby never liked to be penned in anywhere, but we use it to gate off the "band area" of the basement.  It doesn't need to be connected to itself to function well.  If you do plan to connect it in an enclosable shape, it takes a little getting used to the connection mechanism.  My husband has no problem with it at all.  It's very versatile, and I recommend it.
This was great for helping me keep an eye on my little one while I worked. I was working from home, and most days I was upstairs and on the computer. Once she could crawl, she started crawling toward everything dangerous. The litter box, the stairs, plugs, you name it, she found a way to get to it. I bought this and it was great! We even purchased the extension kit, so she basically had the whole room, yet was contained. My oldest son even liked to get in with her to play so she was never &quot;lonely&quot;.I also used this outdoors a lot during summer months. My family is big on campfires and cookouts and this was a great way to ensure her safety, yet not have her confined to a play pen!
I recieved this as a shower gift and began using it when my daughter began to crawl.  It was better than any play yard because there is much more room for toys and for baby.  As she grew (and the number of toys as well), I purchased an extension to make the area bigger.  It was great for both indoor and outdoor use.  We also used it to block the large open area between our kitchen and family room that no other gate would be large enough to cover.  Now that winter is here and she is running about, we are using it to block our wood(pellet) stove to prevent any accidents.  We also plan on using it around our Christmas tree again this year. Other reviews have complained that it is not sturdy or difficult to set up.  I have never had a problem and it folds up and stores easily.  Well worth it for it's versatility.
Initially, I thought this was a great toy. My 5 month old didn't seem to love it, but would sort of press the buttons and screw around with it. Unfortunately, at 6 months, she can now sit up, but has little control over her body. Today, she flailed herself towards the cube and banged her eye socket against one of the corners. She has no injury to her actual eye, but she has a bruise below her eye now, and has been crying all night.I am done with hard plastic. I think I am switching to all soft toys and cubes until she is 1.
We got our twin boys this Mozart Magic Cube for Christmas, when they were 6 months old.  We liked everything about it...except that it was TOO LOUD!  I've actually been amazed at the number of baby toys that are annoyingly loud.  Some to the point that they made our babies cry (like this one).  I've actually had to place duct tape over speaker holes on numerous things such as mobiles, play gyms, and an activity table because otherwise those products are great, just loud.  But therein lies the problem with this toy - there is no obvious speaker hole on it.  It's as if the annoyingly loud music emanates from every crevice.  Which is why it has been put away since Christmas.  Now that the boys are 9.5 months I may try to bring it out again and see if they will tolerate it.  If not I'll just sell this overpriced piece of plastic at my MOMs Resale next month.
I was so excited to get this for my 1yo, and it is a great toy...  My 1yo & 3yo love it.  BUT it has an issue with batteries!  When it arrived (with included batteries in a "try me" box), the batteries were dead.  It's not being played with at a rate that warrants having to change the batteries once or twice a week.  When it begins getting low on power, the music sounds warped, like an old warped record, which is dreadful!  Perhaps we got a defective one.  I don't know.  I hope this isn't happening to others.
My 15 month old still enjoys this toy after getting it for Christmas when she was near 9 months. She didn't quite get it at first since she was so young, but through the months she's enjoyed pushing the buttons, watching the lights go on and off, hearing the music, and now at 15 months knowing that the different buttons do different things. My only complain is that there are a couple of songs that get old quickly, but I guess that comes with every music making toy! I like that it's colorful and the education it provides with the instruments (mommy and daddy are crazy music lovers) as well as the simplicity of the toy. Hopefully she'll enjoy it for a few more months!
This toy seemed very well liked and is recommended on many toy homepages in the Top Ten Toys. I had high hopes but my little boy just doesn't seem interested. We received it early on and I think he liked the sounds of it somewhat. He is now almost 14 months and doesn't really play with it unless he is prompted by  me. Even then he'll only shortly press some buttons and then usually starts picking it up and throwing it. This thing is heavy for a little person and I'm afraid that it could hit his foot or smash through our french doors. I thought it might just take him a little while and that he would be interested as he grows older but so far we could have done without it.
I bought this for my 4-month old son. He is very fussy baby but when I played the music on this cube, he loved it. The best sounds he liked were the flute, piano and the Orchestra. The Best thing about this Music cube is that you can play one instrument at a time and then the final orchestra one to kind of show the music-mix.I believe it will help develop my baby's musical skills.Cons: The battery didn't last long. We used it for 30 days, for about 10 min each day and the battery died down!
We ordered this toy from Drugstore.com, which showed a picture of an older model, not the new "upgraded" toy. The idea of this toy is intriguing but the actual execution of the idea is less than stellar. The "music" is tinny and unattractive. Apparently, the older model had better sound quality, which is why I went with this vendor. However, communicating with Drugstore.com and the whole return process is a significant hassle. The also blamed the deceptive picture they used on a glitch with the manufacturer.  I would actually recommend either getting a used model with all purple corners (the older model) or buying  it at a brick and mortar location so you can actually listen to it. If you are going to purchase on Amazon, consider another vendor. Very disappointed. I will not do business with this vendor again.
My 6 month old LOVES this toy!I was thrilled when he went for it immediately in his playpen and was tap, tap, tapping the buttons - he knew the music should come from this tapping, but I had turned it off!  I do think the on-off switch is a blessing for the parents.  But the music is really pleasant, unlike so many toys.Of course the music is electronic, and I think that would be my only complaint.  I'm a very amateur violinist and would like the violin button to truly sound like strings but instead it's very electronic.However, the piano and French horn are quite good facsimiles.Research tells us that early introduction of classical music to children aids in their developing cognitive abilities.  This is a great way to make music fun for kids and I think all would enjoy this toy.
We got this as a baby shower gift and my son has loved it since he was about 3 months old.  At first, he was fascinated with looking at the lights and hearing the music.  But as he got older, he learned how to play with it more.  He is now almost 18 months and he knows which songs he likes over other ones.  He will hit the blue button multiple times till he gets to the song he wants to hear.  I love that he loves this toy!
I know it says that this is for older babies but my daughter loves looking at the blinking lights and listening to the music. A piece of advice: it took me a little while to figure out that you had to press the orchestra button a few times to change the song. Before I figured this out, the same song was driving me crazy! The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it does not have a volume control button. It is quite loud and I sometimes wish I can make it lower.
My 4-5 month old baby loves this toy.  It is very easy to press the buttons and activate the sounds, so even very young, uncoordinated babies can get this toy to make noise.  As she gets older, she can use the cube to learn about different kinds of sounds and about colors.  For now, though, she just likes to chew on the corners and is delighted whenever the music starts playing.I am giving this four stars instead of five because the cube is secured to its packaging with wire-like pieces of plastic that protrude from the toy.  It is actually very difficult (and maybe impossible) to remove these pieces entirely from the toy, and that presents a danger of poked eyes and scratches.  Eventually, we had to cut the plastic ties very close to the toy and then push the raw ends into the toy, where they still are (and we hope they stay there).  There seems to be no way to remove them entirely.
This is a great transitional toy. We've had it since my son was tiny - as an infant, he liked to look at the lights and colors. At 18 months, he dances to the music and loves pressing the buttons. I don't think he fully gets the concept of adding and removing instruments to the orchestra yet, so once he figures that out, we'll have many more months of fun with the music cube. The music is pleasant - my only complaint is that it only has one volume setting.One word of caution, if you have a climber - this toy makes a great stepping stool for toddlers who like to climb out of their cribs. :)We love the music cube - highly recommend it!
This toy inspires me. I messed with it constantly when my son was an infant and too young to understand how to add and subtract instruments from the full orchestra sound. Now he gets the full functionality of the toy. It lasts for years, offering various entertainments to various ages of kids. Classical music is awesome for babies and little ones, so we love this. Warning, it's very heavy. Don't put it in your backpack when traveling to grandma's (we learned this lesson). The rubberized bumpers on the corners are fantastic for safety. We're never giving away this adorable musical toy.
My husband, son and I all LOVE this toy. My niece had it before, so I knew it was a must-have with my little guy already. I love that he (1 year old) can be exposed to fun classical music with a toy that engages him. He loves that it all lights up (when the buttons on any side are pressed) and he has fun pressing the buttons on the different sides and seeing and hearing the difference it makes (pressing one side engages or unengages the instrument during the song).  An added BIG PLUS for parents - it does have an "off" switch. :)  SO key, even for those of us who appreciate the value and fun of noisy kiddo toys... there is still a time/place for quiet.Great, fun toy. :)
The fabulous Munhkin Mozart Magic Cube was given to our friend's daughter when she was an infant. From a very early age, we watched in amazement as she responded to the sounds of the music, obviously recognizing changes. We could see the pleasure on her face. As time went on, she played with the toy herself and was constantly drawn to it.There was always a limited assortment of toys for her to explore on the living room floor. She loved to play with some more than others. However, she was always constantly drawn back to this -- the sounds of the music from different instruments was a great source of fascination.As she gets older, the way that she handles Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube becomes more selective and sophisticated. This is one of the best toys we have ever seen to develop delight in music!She is beginning to talk now, and I feel certain that her first words will be, "GET ME A HARPSICHORD NOW!!"Love it!
This item has been a life saver for me!  Not only does my child love it but it's the only thing I can distract him with while dressing him (he apparently HATES putting sweaters on). I can hit one of the sides and instantly get flashing lights and music while I try to squeeze a sweater over my child's head. My child loves it because it's easy for him to hit and acheive the same flashing lights and music.  The music is good and there are a lot of different choices.
Fine toy, nice sound.  Much better than most other musical toys.  But I can't give it to my son yet as I can't seem to get these damned wires from the packaging out of the toy.  They are threaded through these tiny holes in the product and I haven't yet gone out to get pliers as someone else suggested.  You shouldn't need pliers to free a toy from its packaging.  Obviously the manufacturer didn't receive the memo that we are pushing for frustration free packaging. I even took out the screws that access the battery pack (which I am quite impressed with as well), hoping to access where the wires are stuck.  No luck.  If they just used regular string, it would easily come out, but these plastic coated wires are too stiff to pull through in the manner that they have put them.
This is a great toy.  My 7 month old daughter loves it and so do many of my musician friends.  There is one significant flaw in its design; this is that the volume is not adjustable and it is too loud.  If it were 1/2 this loud, I'd let me daughter play with it all the time.  As it is, I usually limit her to playing with it with me, so I can hold it away from her head/ears.Due to the too loud volume, I'm giving it a 4 star review, instead of 5.  Otherwise, it is a great, great product.
I love this toy for babies. They have so much fun rolling it and hitting the big buttons to make beautiful music. I love the bouncy ball style corners to keep baby from injuring himself. I love the classical music that does not sound like your typical synthetic baby music. However, I not only have a baby, but two toddlers. This is a heavy toy. It hurts (a lot) when thrown by toddlers. (It does stand up to the beating, so that is a plus.) It also seems to attract use as a step stool since it is a cube & has resulted in quite a few falls. Take this toy away when they are toddlers! And if you have both a baby and a toddler, don't let either play with this toy! It just doesn't make for a very good combination.
After looking for a musical toy that was not annoying, off-key or obnoxious, we discovered this.  Plays several songs by Mozart; baby can play a song with all instruments at once by pressing "orchestra" or one at a time.  Baby can also turn off instruments one at a time. The instruments are clearly synthesized, but still, the quality is not bad and I could listen to it for long periods of time.  I have yet to be annoyed by this toy.  In fact, I may have to buy two - my twins fight over it constantly!  My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that it's a little bit loud.  I wish there was a volume control.
The musical sounds don't sound like the real instruments, they just sound like a cheap toy. Also, I thought each instrument would play its own melody, how it would in a real orchestra. For example, the horn would play the background, the flute a lighter melody, then all the instruments would combine to create the true melody when the orchestra button is pressed. But really, each button plays exactly the same notes except with a different instrument.  I was really disappointed, and my daughter prefers the music buttons from her Tiny Love Activity Center. The ones on that toy are really neat.
Too loud. Too hard. Buttons don't depress easily or distinctly. My 6 month old has fallen headfirst onto the cube and has cut her forehead and chin and jaw on the hard(!) unpadded edges. The corners have sufficient covers but why not the edges between corners??? Buttons require too much strength to push for a 6 month old. She can sometimes manage it her feet if cube is braced against other object. Definitely NOT for under 1 year olds. Battery replacement requires screwdriver.Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube
This toy keeps my 4-month old's attention for a while - she really seems to like the flashing lights as the music plays.I only wish there was a volume button on it - it seems a bit loud to me (and if it seems loud to me wouldn't it seem loud to the baby as well?), and I wish it weren't quite so heavy.  It will be a long time before my baby will be able to turn the cube or pick it up, for now it just sits on the floor between her legs and she's able to hit the buttons that are facing up/out.
I think a lot of kids these days have this toy. It's quite popular. All my friends with babies have it.It's a toy providing light entertainment.I'm a trained musician and I disagree with some reviews saying that the quality of the sound is poor. Trust me, for a toy it's totally fine. You can still tell the instruments apart. You can't expect your baby to become a little Mozart just by listening to this cube 5 minutes a day anyway.Everything seems to function well. It's safe. I'm not scared to turn away for 30 seconds. I know that there are no sharp edges and my baby won't hurt herself.I'm not sure this toy carries a lot of educational / developmental value but it's nice.
My 4 year old son spotted this toy while we were out shopping for my 4 month old daughter. He couldn't help but play with this in the store and I thought that since my baby loves music so much she would probably enjoy this. I was a little put off by the price. (I paid a bit more than it is here) but it was worth it! My daughter was totally fascinated by the flashing lights and music and I even found myself and my son playing with it together! I'm sure as she gets older, she will really enjoy how interactive it is. Such a cool toy. And the best part? Unlike many other toys that make noise, this one is not annoying at all! The instruments sound so realistic that it's enjoyable to listen to. I would recommend this and will probably give as a baby gift in the future.
I got it for my 1 year old son.  He likes to push the buttons and listen to the music.  It's sturdy.  He's thrown it a few times already, and it bounced off the hardwood and still works fine.My only qualm with it is that it sounds like the batteries are dying.  Some of the music just isn't the greatest sounding.  Now, he doesn't care, but as a parent who gets to listen to this for seemingly hours when it's his toy of interest, it becomes grating.  I changed out the batteries and it sounded the same.  :-/Given that I know this, I also know that he loves playing with it, and that outweighs my feelings.  I'd get it again in a heartbeat if we ever lost this!
Got this as a gift when baby was 5 months. He liked mouthing the somewhat soft corners and I played it for him. He now plays it himself (13 months). I do not think he gets he can turn off and on each instrument but I suppose that will come. The quality of music is very good, not mechanically computerized like some toys. It has five or so songs and you can turn off and on each instrument. That is pretty neat. Baby likes it. The only problem is that there is no volume control. Batteries last a pretty long time in it. The songs are nice too, jazzy and complex enough to be interesting. It seems really tough. It has withstood some hard knocks. It has a very solid feel, which worried me at first because I was afraid baby would hurt himself face-planting into it, but no injuries. The corners are rounded and slightly rubbery. It's kind of heavy so just now has baby really been able to haul it around.
I had high hopes for this item based on other reviews, but it was a huge letdown.  It plays one tune with different instruments, and it is too loud for a baby.  With a music background, I really want to expose my son to beautiful, classical music.  This is not the item to do that with.  I will keep looking for other musical toys with more variety and sophistication.Update:  This is still my least favorite toy, mainly due to the volume.  I wish I could turn it down.  Thanks to a helpful comment, I did manage to play all the tunes and felt fairly silly not reading the directions beforehand.  I sill stick with my original rating, though.  There are just so many better toys out there.
I always read reviews on this website and the Babies R Us site before buying a product. This product got great reviews so I bought it - I was not disappointed.I bought this for my son when he was about 4 months old. The music and flashing lights immediately captured his attention and, as he grew, he played with it more and more. I keep it in his playpen and it's easily his favorite toy (besides his exersaucer and jumperoo). It keeps him entertained longer than other toys.I like that it's easily washable and has soft rubber-like corners (so, if baby falls on it, no sharp or hard corners to scratch himself on).I also think the music is nice - nothing too annoying like a lot of toys out there. And, with the click of the "Orchestra" side, the song changes.So glad I bought this!Update 6/10: My son will be 12 months old this weekend and he STILL loves his Mozart Cube!
Based on the myriad of reviews here, I purchased this toy when my triplets were several months old.  To be honest, they did not care for or notice it until they were closer to 8 or 9 months.  At that point, they realized they could start and stop the music by hitting at it.  All of a sudden, they took great interest in it.  It was also excellent when they were just learning to sit unassisted.  They could lean forward and balance on the cube while playing at the same time.Now that they have "figured" it out, the toy is a little less appealing.  I am waiting for the next enjoyment phase to kick in when they start noticing and playing with the different instruments.My only complaint, and it is a minor one, is that battery life is shorter than I would have expected.  While not bad, it seems to slow down more quickly than our other battery operated toys.
I like this seat mostly because Elmo seems to have magical powers over little ones!  If your kid is like mine, however, and likes to sit on the potty "unproductively" you might want to consider something a little more comfortable.  The plastic frame that the cushion sits on has a rim around the inside.  While your child is sitting, the fairly cheaply made cushion settles down and your child's butt is now resting on the edge of the hard plastic.  Our daughter would always get up and complain about her butt hurting.  Depending on what kind of toilet seat you have, it also has a tendency to slip around.  I had to put some non-skid pads on the bottom so that it wouldn't fall into the toilet with a toddler's wiggling around.  You could end up with pinched fingers or a soaked tot.
This does fit on an elongated toilet seat, but it slides around. It wouldn't dump my kid in or anything, but the slipping might startle a child. I may see if I can find some sort of anti-slip stickers. I did not bother with the splash guard, I just threw it out. It looked flimsy and unnecessary. My daughter loves the SpongeBob theme. I'm not so fond of the vinyl seat, as my daughter's hiney sticks to it and is a little uncomfortable when she gets up. But, it's cheap enough and serves its purpose - allowing my daughter to sit on the big potty without falling in.
this is a good toilet ring, but ONLY if you have the smallest, round toilet seats.  the package blatantly lies in saying that it fits elongated seats - it will fit, but it'll also slide around and leave large gaps.  my home has a mix of elongated/round seats, and i found that the baby bjorn rung is the best for the larger bowls.  we use that for our elongated seats, and this ring for the tiny toilet that's in the hallway.  otherwise this ring - which can not be adjusted to fit - will slide around a lot and feel very unstable when you're trying to toilet train.
The toilet set is nice.  Other reviewers had complained that it did not fit on their toilet seats but I have three different toilets and it works on all three.  It is a nice design and my son love that Thomas, Percy, & James are all on his potty seat.  The one problem is that it does not have a splash guard.  The packaging says it was supposed to have a splash guard and handle to hang on the toilet handle.  It did not come with either of these and when I contacted the seller she claimed they were not supposed to come with the seat.  According to the packaging and description they were!  My son was attached as soon as it saw it so I couldn't return it.  Check when you buy one of these.  If you have a boy you may not want to buy this unless it has the splash guard.
I just started potty training my two year old son and I found the Thomas potty seat to be a great incentive. The seat is cushioned so it's nice and comfortable and it fits nicely on most seats. It's also compact enough to fit in the diaper bag if you want to take it on the go. For boys, it does come with a splash guard. The padded part of the seat lifts up and it gets inserted between the plastic and padding. It stays in place most of the time, but it is easy to misplace. I would have preferred it to be permanently attached, but aside from that I am happy with this purchase.
We got two of these for relatively cheap. In concept, it's great. We have one at our house and it fits all of the toilets (we have 2 toto toilets, one Kohler and one other brand (not sure which) and it fits fine). My in laws have one at their house that we leave there and their toilets are round seats (Kohler and American Standard). We've never had any fit problems.The problem is the design. Pee trickles between the plastic and the cushion and pools there. Even if you clean it regularly, it smells NASTY. If you forget to clean it, next time you pick it up, the nasty pee drips everywhere.I am in the process of ordering a different one so that I can get rid of this one. Gross.
I ordered this product because it was advertised to have a built-in splash shield, which many don't. I specifically researched and looked for one with that for my little girl. It says it has one and the picture shows it. However, the actual product does not have one. I opened the package, thinking it might be inside the wrapping,but no, it wasn't. Now, I'm out $15 and still have to look for another one.Two days later: I am adding this note on and raising my rating from one star to four stars. After I wrote the above review, amazon contacted me within 24 hours and offered me a refund, even if I wanted to keep the item. I was so surprised by the generosity of that offer. Amazon once again has proved itself excellent in customer satisfaction and really checked the reviews to see if they could make the situation better. I really appreciate that and love amazon all the more for it. Thank you, amazon.
I know the dimensions are listed, but for some reason I was surprised at how big/long the caterpillar is.  Because it is not like a big stuffed animal (long and thin) it was very easy for my 4 month old to hug and hold.  He can easily pull it to his mouth to bite on it.  He's almost 6 months now and can focus on one area or another...it is still big for him.  So I can see how for the next few months, he'll still be interested because it is big and he can do more and more with it.  my 2 year old niece visited and latched onto it and began imagination play.
I think there was so much written about this that my head probably over rated it and now I'm discontent. My kids doesn't even look at it unless I'm on all fours like a dog and carrying it in my mouth. But, really, I don't think he's looking at the worm at all but thinking, &#34;Mommy has gone bow wow wow crazy.&#34; It's soft and not even cute. Just, it is. That's it. No magic, just what you see people. If what you see on the screen isn't making you scream and yell, it'll probably get the same reaction. You want more, prepare to crawl and bark.
We have two of these gates and we couldn't be more pleased with them.  They took a little time to install (it was a snap the second time around), and they are as sturdy and secure as you can get.  We don't feel the slightest twinge of concern when our 1 year old leans against this gate at the top of the steps.  We know it's not going anywhere.  The gate is so simple to open and close.  A small child would not be able to do it on his or her own though.  The gate's design ensures that little climbers will not be able to get a lift.  We've tried lots of gates and this one is our favorite.
I have four different gates in my house, and this, by far, is the most secure and stable. Therefore, it's at the top of my stairs... the most important place. I feel like I could even sit on that gate, and it's no going to budge.When we have guests over, they have trouble opening it, because you have to squeeze really hard, but I like that I have to squeeze really hard... it keeps my child who is now a clever 3.5 year old from being able to open it do this day.
We recently moved into a new house and bought and installed 3 of these gates. Within one week, our 13 month old broke two of the gates. Once by holding onto the rungs and shaking the gate the other time by grabbing one of the rungs when he tripped.Both times the rung popped right out breaking at the top and bottom. This left a gap in the rungs wide enough for our son to stick his head through which means he could get past the gate if we kept it up (which of course we didn't.)
We love this gate!  We purchased two, one for the top of the stairs and one for downstairs.  Let me tell you a few reasons why this will be the only baby gate we will buy.1.  You can take the gate part off when not needed, yet it is safe enough for the top of the stairs.2.  Even 5 year olds still cannot open it.  All other baby gates become useless as soon as the kids figure out how it works.3.  You can buy extra sets of hardware to move the gate around depending on the circumstances.4.  It's so cheap!These are just the top few reasons why we love this gate.  Give it a try.
We currently live in housing on base in Germany and the stairs are very wide and unusual. I got this gate since it is made for the top of the stairs and was wide enough for our staircase. It works great! I love that it slides to the side as well as opens. Was a breeze to install and I feel really safe with the fact that it is a really great hardware mount. No complaints here my son is 10 months and pulls up on everything so it is nice to know he is safe! The one hand open is really simple and I like it more than any gate I have seen at friends houses.
Our house is a front to back split. We have a lot of stairs. 5 openings to stairs! These gates have been great for my sanity. At first we bought a big playard gate that we opened up to cover two sets of stairs. I had to climb over that at least 100 times a day! Now we have these walk-through stair gates which are easy to use when holding the baby. Before we also had a gate that just expanded to fit the door way and was attached to walls. I was always concerned my daughter would fall down the steps if the gate gave way because she would pull herself up on it. These gates I know they are locked and they are much sturdier. I like that they slide back and forth; it's easier to get through entries.We used wood that matched our stair case so that we didn't have to drill into the post of our railing. I highly recommend this gate.
I got this set for my 4 year old and he loves it. The dinosaurs are colorful and there are a lot of them to arrange on the little background. I am happy with the number and look of the dionos, trees and volcanoes. However I give it only 3 stars because the background is small and very flimsy, and the set really smells bad. Every time we open the box there is a very strong unpleasant plastic smell coming from inside the box. Not sure if it's the box it's-self or the contents.  I thought I would air it out a bit so I left the lid off over night, but when I entered the room in the morning the whole room smelled terrible from it. I really don't like the idea of my kid inhaling the fumes of some unknown plastic chemicals each time he opens the set so it now stays open and stored in the garage.  We play with them outside and they work fine for that.
So the container they come in is a little hard to open and close for small children but no less the fact that it comes in it's own organizational container is very pleasing.  The bottom of each of the dinosaurs states what dinosaur it is a model of. I use a set of flash cards with information about the dinosaurs in combination with these dinosaurs to teach my son while we play. These are nothing more than dinosaur figures but they are very accurate with no odd color combinations like purple with pink spots or something silly like that. They are made of hard durable plastic. I think they are slightly expensive for what they are you can buy similar products at the dollar store but those products like the educational value of these ones.  Overall, I would recommend these my son finds them fun to play with and they stimulate his imagination.  I only give them 4 stars because they are slightly expensive.
My son loves to play "dino world" just about every day!! The tub is great for storing the set & theres plenty of room for more things.  We keep a bunch of blocks and small cars in there to add tothe scene and creative play.  The mat it comes with is kind of a joke , lasting maybe one day.  But that's no reason to not buy this.Like others, we purchased thise elsewhere for MUCH less than the 60-something Amazon is currently selling it.
Comes with 20 dinosaurs, 12 small rocks, a large volcano, a medium sized volcano, 6 trees, and a play mat. This set is great. I would prefer more dinosaurs and less rocks, but oh well. It is still great. My three and a half year old loves playing with this set. The play mat is actually pretty cheap, but my son doesn't seem to care. It is made of really thin plastic and doesn't stay open all the way since it has been folded. Once you put all the dinosaurs on it, though, it stays down just fine. All the rest of the stuff is high quality and the tub is great for keeping everything together. Just for size reference, the brachiosaurus is 6 1/2 inches tall, and this is the biggest dinosaur in the set. I'm really happy with the size of all the dinosaurs. I was worried that they were going to be kind of small, but they are a perfect size.
As I am wtitng this review my 5 year old son just re-discovered this set, since I had it at the top of the closet. He can play hours with this great quality dinosaurs he got for his b-day. He had a few more, big and small ones that he just added to this set, so it is pretty amazing what he does when he's playing with all of them. The quality of the mat is awful, but you really don't need the mat for this set.
This walker is great for tall babies like my son and the toys are enough to keep him busy.  The only issue I have with it is that the legs don't have a very strong system for holding the walker up on it's different levels.  It is made like an exersaucer rather than having "x" bars to go up and down, and one of the back legs won't stay in position.  While it could be an isolated issue, the plastic seems more flimsy than it should be.  Also, only the front wheels swivel which I didn't think was a big deal, but it does seem to hinder my son from going in any direction he wants at a given time.
I did my research on a walker and decided on this one thankfully. The wheels move great. Very loose. If you get one and the wheels are tight, call Graco and have them replace it. It rolls well on carpet tile and pavement.I love the fact that it has the removeable noise making device with an ON/OFF switch. It takes 3 "AA" batteries. It can get dirty on the tray under the noise device too.My 4 mo. old son loves it. I love it. When I go to the gym, I throw it in the back of the truck. Then just take it out of the truck, put the boy in, and roll him right into the gym. He lets me run on the treadmill for an hour when he's in it. Very handy.
I recieved a similar model to this walker, one without the electronic tray, for my daughter.  My only complaint is the rear wheels are difficult to roll.  Unlike the front wheels, the rear wheels are fixed and therefore can only roll straight forward or backward, not side to side.  This sometimes made for difficult maneuvering for my daughter. Overall, it is not a bad walker and I do plan on using it for my next baby due in January only because I do not want to purchase another one.  I would not recommend it though.  There are better walkers out there.
As the mother of six grown children, I realize the importance of a playpen when babies start to explore their environment...we can't watch them every moment. I am now a grandmother who babysits for my daughter. I ordered this to use at my own home, and have had such a good experience with it that I ordered a second one for her to use at her house. The color is vibrant for lots of visual stimulation. The playpen is also a good size. Take it from this grandmother that this is definitely the best. 5 stars*****
How FUN and AWESOME!!! Got this for my grandson and still can't get over how bright and playful this is. Even I want to get in it and play! The built in activities on the side are the best. The squeaker is a bit hard to press and sure you will have to do for baby...but the other toys are super! It was so so so simple to put up!!! Love the bigger size, while not being overwhelming...those smaller play yards just are too small to be used when you need them most...
I am so happy with this play yard.  When  I put my four month old down inside it he looked around then looked up at me and smiled, I kid you not.  The only complaint I have is that the description here on Amazon says that the play yard is 38x38.  However when the box arrived it indicated that it is only 36X36, still plenty of space though.  I only paid $49.00 because I have the Amazon credit card and get reward certificates to use towards products, so between that and the free shipping I got a GREAT BUY for a GREAT PRODUCT.  Thank you Amazon and Graco!
I did some research before buying this playard and I am very happy i did.  It is the most colorful out there, easy to assemble and travel with. My baby is very particular, but she loves this playard.  It may to be obvious at first, but each of the walls has a bug with some functions.  for instance, the butterfly has wings that have foil inside to make squishing sound when you touch the,m.  The other bug, when squeezed, makes a sound, the third one, has rattles in its wings, and finally, the sun is a mirror (not a great one though). Given its price and the fact that it is being discontinued, I highly recommend getting one before they are off the market.
I give this a 5 start plus.My 6 month old Grandbaby  was put in this playpen yesterday for his first time.  It was obvious he really liked it by the big smiles and how his mind was preoccupied with the play items on the sides and bottom. It was a difficult first baby shots day and he was hurting on both legs. The graphics and sides toys kept him more focused on fun & he was able to get some temporary relief.  I know as he feels better he is going to enjoy his new & safe play space even more.Thank you Amazon for this colorful playpen choice at the lowest price and your excellent service. I'll positively be back.
I have this playpen for about a month now but is still never used by my 6 month old baby. He cries whenever I put him in. I like it because it is huge and cute. What I do not like is that it lacks cushion. It is hard, not soft that I'm afraid when my baby rolls over, e would hurt himself. I am waiting for my baby to grow up a little more, may be he'll like it when he is already able to stand. I hope he would.
I love this pack n' play.  I bought my son the pack n' play in rise n' shine with a bassinet.  What a waste.  This is the best pack n' play.  My mom bought one for her house and after I saw how much my son liked it I immediately went out and bought one for myself.  He loves the stuff on the sides and stares at the bright colors.  Also, it is a lot bigger than most of the other pack n' plays and will come in really handy for holding toys when my son gets a little older.  I definitely recommend this.
I ordered this for our 4 month old son and when it arrived I opened it up myself and didnt read the directions at first I got frustrated since I couldnt get it together then read them and voila it took me and a freind about 3 minutes to set it up! Our son is past the stage where he will stay put in a floor bouncy chair so he loves the freedom of lying in this stretching out,and kicking. We loved it so much we ordered one for my mother in law so she can have in her house when he comes to visit. He also takes naps in it, we are hoping to travel with a smaller version of this pack and play soon...will let you know how that works out.
Just got this playpen a few days ago. It is awesome! Set it up without instructions in under 2 minutes, and I'm 6 months pregnant which makes some things a challenge. It's a very nice size and fits a good deal of toys, though if the room is small it does take up a lot of space. Baby loves the bug toys on the sides. She's just learning to sit on her own and I was very pleased to see when she fell back she did not cry - the floor pad is thick and soft so it cushioned her head. I like that because she did fall backwards once in her gym (placed on the carpet) and was very upset. With this I know if she falls back she won't get hurt. It's very colorful and she really seems to enjoy her time in it. Great purchase!
Still using this... its big and he doesn't mind going in it for me to shower. We also have used it to help him calm down, if he throws a fit we just sit him in with a toy and tell him when he is ready we will get out. Works well, just walk away and he calms down without an audience. Then we get back out, also when I tell him I want him to go in so I can take a shower he goes to it and waits to be put in. So he definately doesn't mind. He likes the toys in it too, wheres the baby (the mirror) was a favorite.
We have used it only once to travel, it was easy to asemble, the parts seem to be of really good quality, the colors and decoration are nice. Our baby slept and played in it during our 3 day trip, I was able to move it around the house were we stayed with no problem. The mat seems to be a little thin but a couple of blankets wrapped around it made it seem much more comfortable to sleep in it. Because is larger than the average our baby was very comfortable and had plenty of room to move around, the downside is that it makes it a little heavy, not a big deal unless you're planning to hike mount Everest with it. Fits well in any SUV trunk leaving plenty of space for luggage. Disassembling it was a breeze and packing it was pretty straight forward. I'll recommend this product.
I think this playpen is great; it's spacious, sturdy, and colorful. My 10 month old thinks it's a prison. She will tolerate it for about 10-15 minutes at a time, which is fine because it buys me some time where I don't have to worry about her safety. I first introduced her to the playpen when she was about 7 months old. I think she found all of the characters at the bottom to be frightening, but she was fine after I put the sheet on. I'd hoped she'd grow to spend more time in the playpen, but tolerates it less and less as she becomes more mobile.
This is a great for play.  I really like the built-in toys and bright colors.However, I bought it for our vacation as a place to play and sleep.  Unfortunately, the pad is somewhat uncomfortable and the sheets (must be purchased from company other than Graco) cause the pad to be a little lumpy.  My daughter would also wake up and want to play with the toys in the middle of the night and then had a hard time going back to sleep.Although I love the size of it, it is quite awkward to move around when open since it is heavy and large.Still worthy of 4 stars since it does what is says it will do.  I am happy with it.
We were quite excited to find this product - thought it was like the  type of playpen from 20 years ago to use for a child. There was no weight limit and the only height limit on the website was when the child was big enough to climb out - from both Amazon and from Graco, so it was perfect for our larger baby.Lots of disappointment when the package was opened and we discovered that is has the same limits (in the owner's manual) as the regular pack-n-play. Between when I ordered in and when it was delivered, the words PACK 'N PLAY were actually added to the title of it.Luckily, Amazon seems to be pretty good about taking it back, but we are quite disappointed.
I have been looking for the play yard that I had for my children. The other pack and plays are too small. I don't understand why they don't sell these in stores all the time. I live in Hawaii and have been trying to buy one of these for three years. No one would ship to Hawaii. When, I saw it on Amazon. I was amazed and decided to try to order it. I was really shocked as I was going through checkout. And, amazingly they were letting me order it. The shipping was really cheap. And, I ordered it on Sunday and received it on Wednesday. How, wonderful. My grandson was put in there immediately to see his reaction. He is only 6 months old and loved it. Thank You Amazon for having this wonderful product. And, of course shipping it to me. I am going to order one more. Just totally LOVE it.
I like this pack n play. The only problem I have is that the middle kind of sinks in so unless your baby is a highly experienced sitter, it is tough for them to balance b/c it's slanted in towards the center. But the colors are pleasing and I didn't know this but the animals/sun embroidered on all 4 sides have little attachements that the baby can play with when their in the pack n play. That was a nice little surprise. My daugter loves the little wings on the bee b/c they have little rattles in them and they make noise when she hits them.
Although this isn't the lightest thing to carry, it is very serviceable! Ever since I purchased this play pen for my grandson, it has been used every weekday. It goes up about 8 a.m. and down about 4:30 p.m. It still looks as new as the first time we used it. I like the netting one the sides and the padding on the floor and rail. Also, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to set it up or take it down. And, it is bigger than the beds that turn into play pens in the Graco line.
why do I love this play pan?  Very simple:1. Great quality material; sturdy and safe2. Large with lots of space (my grandson crawls around).  Can fit two kids!3. Very easy to assemble!3. Very colorful!  Bright beautiful colors.  My grandson looks at it and want to jump from my arms inside of the pan.4. The colorful patches around it are toys!The toys are:a) A beautiful butterfly with wings that when squeezed it make a dried plastic sound (he loves it)b) A lady bug that makes sounds alsoc) A sun with a mirror (safe for babies)d) A bee with playful wings, which also makes soundsI strongly recommend this play pan!  My daughter has another one, not Graco, that is half of the size.  It is nice but not eye catching like this one.It is worth every single penny!
As soon as I opened the box, I could tell by the VOC's that this playard was treated with chemicals.  I called Graco to confirm that it is indeed treated with fire retardants.  In addition, some of the characters on the side panels contain vinyl...like the entire face of the sun is PVC.  Why would you let your child play, let alone sleep in this toxic chemical stew.  I called Joovy about their Room2 Playard.  It's the same size but quite a bit more expensive. The representative told me it was not treated with fire retardants.  Definitely worth it to pay the extra $, knowing my children won't be exposed to harmful chemicals.
Buy this Pack N Play!!  All pros and no cons on this.  It was so simple to assemble, it took only about 3 minutes from box to being put up, and some of that time was to remove the tags. Only three parts, just the frame, the folding padded floor, and the carrying bag.  It is roomy, has plenty of padding, and has 9 legs for a strong and even base.  It is great for sleeping away from home, and great for playtime, because there is enough room for baby to crawl around and sptill have plenty of room for toys in with him.  You can purchase sheets for sleeping, but you won't need extra padding or an extra mattress, it's soft enough. It's easily moved from room to room.I put a different pack N play together a few months ago from the same company and it was a nightmare!  In my opinion, this is the best on the market.
Our family loves this product! We used it from infancy to over age one year. It was very easy to set up and assemble the first time. Directions very easy to follow and took only minutes to assemble. It has very easy to clean fabric. Just wipe it down. Baby loved the toys on each side of the play pen and also the colorful block pattern on the mat. The size and height of this product is just perfect. Large play area inside. This product has held up to alot of use for over a year and still looks new! It came with a reusable bag to store it in and make for easy carry in car. Also, we found no safety issues w/this product. I did alot of research before choosing this product and this one meets our high standards. I highly recommend it.
Overall I adore this playpen. It is bright, well made and sturdy but the reason I gave it 3 stars is that it has a terrible slope toward the center. Our baby tries to roll over and always rolls back into the center where it is low.  One time she rolled to the center placing her head lower than her feet.  This scared me so I feel we can only use it when we are sitting right beside the playpen watching her. January 2013.  We are still using this playpen and it has held up well.  Our daughter who is 16 months now still loves this and it has no damage after a full year of daily use.
I fancy myself a &#34;stylish&#34; mom; expensive nursery set, shopping at Restoration Hardware and Pottery Barn Baby. We got the black and grey pack 'n' play that goes well with our home decor, then my parents picked up this pack 'n' play for their home. Our daughter hated the pack 'n' play we had and loved theirs so we ended up getting one too. She loves the colors, and playing with the items on the sides. I love it because it is a square and much larger than the plain one we had. We HIGHLY recommend.
I can't express how much I love this play yard. My son has been using and playing in this since he was 5 months old and he is 15 months old now. The bright colors, designs, and toys caught his attention right away. When I put him in other play yards we have, he won't stay in it long and wants to come out right away, but when we put him in this play yard he is completely distracted and has fun playing in it with his other toys. There is a lot of space for him to move around and it is very sturdy. I also love how easy it is to set up and take down plus the carry bag makes it easier to bring when traveling back and forth to his grandma's house. I would definitely recommend this to anyone!
I love this product in all respects, except for the four paneled padded flooring.The design of it tends to not lay flat, once you put a sheet or a cover on it.This is a real flaw in the design.  AND, it is super important that you follow thedirections for putting this up, and be sure to use the velcro straps to securethe flooring pad in place.  Just get the help of another person to secure thevelcro straps, and you will be all set.  Otherwise, I do like the sturdiness of theside rails, and the bright primary colors.  Not the best for napping, as thebaby will continuously play with the built in side toys.  Some of the toysrattle and crinkle, and once baby finds the party, they will not want to laydown to nap.  But I still love this playyard so much, I bought two of them!
I am very thankful I chose this particular pack-n-play. I've seen the ones my friends have for their babies and I definitely got the best one!!! It also folds up easily and stores nicely. It is a little heavy, but they all are to me. It is sturdy and I think it will last. Sheets that fit this particular model are pricey, though, as it's not the average rectangular shape. Other than that, it is perfect! My daughter loves it and so do I!
Highly recommend this to all parents with Infant and Toddlers. This is such a great playpen to have in your home as an alternative to the crib. My son loves to play in it and also sleep in his playpen which we put in the living room. We bought this together with some fitted pack n play (Graco Square Play Yard) from SheetWorld on Amazon (if anyone is interested) and the sheets totally fit the square pad that comes with the playpen. We also made an extra padding cushion so it would be comfortable for our son to sleep in. You can also fold this up nicely and make it compacted for traveling if need to. This is a great purchase! :) You will not dissapoint.
I saw this playpen and thought it was adorable, bright colored, and fun. But I already have another pack and play and I read it was big and cost 100 dollars so I placed it on my private wish list. Well, to my lovely surprise, my mother had also independently seen this playpen on Amazon and bought it for my little baby boy. It is truly awesome and my son loves it! What I love about it? Well.......it's so nicely colored, screams cuteness all over, and it's very easy to set up and take down. I also love how spacious it is and I have fun playing peek-a-boo with my little one too! They say mothers know best..... and in my case.... that was true! Buy it, you won't regret it.
I love the size and sturdiness of it! Gives kids more play room than the average playpen. It also holds up well to our large baby playing wildly in it. She loves the various objects on the sides and the different noises and such they have to offer. We haven't traveled with it so can't comment on the transportability. The pad that comes with is not waterproof and even with a thick quilted cover under the sheet tinkle still leaks through to the pad so I suggest getting a plastic cover for under the sheet. Overall a great buy!
I LOVE these because they are really convenient and easy to use. We have it by our pool (baby gated) under the overhang so we can enjoy the pool and sun and yet have LO out there playing or asleep at the same time. It is very convenient. I do not like the cleaning issues. It is hard to clean and though it is billed &#34;PACK N PLAY&#34; like it is the &#34;umbrella stroller&#34; of play yards, it is hardly that easy to just fold and run.
I registered for this pack n play solely on the wonderful amazon reviews that I read. I wanted something larger for my baby to play in, and the Graco TotBloc definitely delivers.  That being said, this pack n play stinks as a napping or travel crib.  It's large, bulky, the foam bottom is thin and not very comfy for baby to sleep on, and there is no mattress option for a pack n play this size!  I took this on a trip last weekend and put the baby in there with a blanket on the bottom so she wasn't uncomfortable. Every time she rolled around, it would make the rattle toy attached to the walls of the pack n play move. It actually woke her up, and it was a long night. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone wanting this to double as a napping crib.If I had to do it all over again, I would have gone with the Joovy like I originally planned.
I'm an older mom (40+) who did a lot of babysitting as a teen and remembers what big, square playpens used to be like...not the cramped, rectangular things everyone has now. This spacious pack and play is wonderful! Our 10-month-old daughter loves it - we have it in our kitchen so we can set her in it for a few minutes while we use the stove or chop up food (cases where, for obvious reasons, we wouldn't want her underfoot). She can see us, we can talk with her, and she has plenty of room to practice pulling herself up and walking along the edges (and falling on her bum on the padded floor). When she was younger, she loved playing with the attached toys (especially the butterfly with the crinkly wings).It's sturdy, easy to set up and take down, and packs away neatly into its carrying case. An all-around great product!
This playyard is amazing! It's such a good deal for the money. It makes the other playyards look like a joke! Most other playyards are dark and the mesh is dark so your baby can't see out and therefore wants to get out asap. This playyard is really bright and gorgeous, and the mesh is clear so baby can see out. It looks inviting and fun to be in there! Also, other playyards are uncomfortable- no wonder your baby screams to get out- the floors aren't thick enough and the support bars can be felt through the floor. This playyard has a really thick, high-quality floor that is comfortable and baby could sleep on. Also, this playyard is really big- huge!- which makes it way nicer for baby. I am so glad I found this playyard online!
I have had this pack n' play for a few weeks now and my son seems to enjoy it.  We use it for quick corralling, not prolonged play time.  He likes the toys on the sides, and I like that it is larger than most of the play yards I've seen, granting that my experience is limited.-It goes up and down VERY easily and quickly.-It is not very heavy for the size and sturdiness.  My parents have a Cosco playyard that they borrowed from a friend for when we visit.  Theirs is about half the size and seems almost as heavy.-The square shape on the TotBloc is nice, too because he can move around a bit in there and actually get somewhere instead of just rolling over once and hitting the end.-There is no listed weight limit on this, only a height limit.  That was a major deciding factor for my big boy!Overall I think it's a great product for the price.
I bought this play yard to put my 8 month old in when I need to keep her contained and safe while I am cooking. It is perfect. The size is ideal as she is able to roll and move around it and play with her toys but does not take up all of the room in our small living area. The pad seems comfy and she will be able to nap in it. The toys on the sides are great, she loves to play with the butterfly. I am very happy with this product.
OMG....this play pen is a life saver. My son crawls around like crazy. When I'm in the kitchen cleaning up or fixing dinner I can't always be watching him so this is perfect. He hangs out and plays or stands up and (tries) to talk to me. I don't keep him in here for a long period of time because I feel that he needs to be a kid and crawl around too.  It's easy to pack up too. I took it to the park with me. I shoved it in the bottom of our UppaBaby Vista stroller. #NYCMom**KEY NOTE*** the middle part has to be up for the sides to bend down.
Very big and roomy. Folds and sets up with ease. My only complaint is that although you can remove the bottom pad, the cover on it is not removeable or water proof, so there is no way to wash it and feel like it's "clean". There are sheets for this square play yard to purchase separately, but they aren't all that cheap and sheets themselves are not waterproof. So if your baby soils through his diaper onto the mattress, or your toddler has a barf-fest, good luck trying to get that smell out. You can "spot clean" with a warm rag, but lets face it. Poop and puke requires the washer. And you're not able to do that with this pad.
We bought it last week and it was so easy to set up - I only looked at the help on the back of the mat once when I could not figure out why the fourth rail would not lock - turned out they do not lock if the floor is all the way back. Pulling the center up just an inch allowed to lock it and the babe went in. He instantly loved it - he can see everyone through the mesh, he loves playing with wings of two butterflies (rattle and crinkle) and  tries to pick the smiley faces from the mat or kiss them. At 7,5 months old, he enjoys up to an hour  in it playing there on his own (he is not really crawling yet but learned to sit up on his own and can roll around it to reach toys and wings on the side panels. I read some reviews that the floor is not too even, but I did not notice it with mine.
This is a great play space for our son! We have a sizable great room, which is child-proofed and gated off from the rest of the house. But once our son started crawling, we needed a safe place to put him while working in the kitchen. We had a regular pack-n-play, but it seemed cramped. This is perfect! It's roomy enough for him to spread out with a few books or toys, and entertain himself for long enough that we can put away groceries, cook a meal, or do a load of dishes. Everyone's happy!
I recently bought this for 7 month old daughter who is just starting to crawl. It the perfect thing to keep her amused for anywhere from 20minutes to an hour! It means I can go to the bathroom in peace and get some chores done knowing she is safe and amused.It is super easy to put together - it literally takes less than a minute - take out of the box - unfold it and it clicks into place. The pictures on the side are of good quality and my daughter likes to pull and play with them.We also have a weekend home - so bought two of these. I would guess this could also double as a crib for the weekend house - ie - for a night or two at a time.Highly recommend for the 7 - 10 month phase of baby's development.
I love this pack n play!  The other ones that are rectangular and fancier did not work for us (and they were twice the price).... It was the one with a changing table and bassinet.  I finally relented one day and bought this one because it was bigger, boxier and roomier. My son hates restraints and being boxed in, but he is much more okay with this larger pack n play, and is willing to stay in it for 20-30 minutes at a time (a record!).  And he is 2.5 now, so it will definitely last longer than the rectangular ones you see everywhere....
When my daughter started rolling, it was time for a little containment -- but Grandma bemoaned the fact that none of the standard play yards had as much space as the playpens of my childhood. (You remember, the massive wooden ones Moms would schlep from house to beach to park?) So looking for roomy containment plus the convenience of a portable play yard, there was only one viable candidate: the Graco PackNPlay Bugs. There's room enough for my 7-month-old and a hundred toys, it folds easily into its shoulder bag, cleans up in a snap and the price is great. Best of all, and unlike most play yards, it's FUN; my girl could spend an hour just batting at the colorful bugs on the walls (all make sounds) and floor or giggling at herself in the built-in mirror. And as a play space, it's a happy medium between a tiny play yard and a huge Superyard.
We have this one and love it. My son typically doesn't like a pack and play or even to be in the crib too long. But, it is great for those days when they are small and you want to be outside at an outing and don't want to have to sit and hold your child all day. When my son was a little baby, we pulled out the mat and hooked up the toy dangler and he was amazed for hours. My son is now 14 months old and we recently took a 3 day vacation and took it along. We set it up in the hotel room and it worked perfectly. It also saved us the money of having to rent a crib at the hotel. He likes all the animals on the sides. Not to mention, what a dream to put up and take down. We have an older model pack and play and it is very hard to get the sides up and down. This one is so easy! Highly recommend.
These are one of only a few brands of bottles out there that has a variety of nipples so if your baby doesn't like one nipple, you can try the others.  Most other bottles only offer one nipple and if your baby doesn't like it, you have to buy a completely different set of bottles.These bottles are also interchangeable with the Playtex Premium bottles, so you can have a variety of colors and designs.Get an extra box of liners for each size.These are easy to clean, just toss the liner and wash the bottle in warm, soapy water.  Not scrubbing with a bottle brush to get the lump of formula out of the bottom.  :c)
Ok, my 3 yr. old shouldn't be drinking out of a bottle anymore BUT, I have really put these bottles to good use! I have a 1 1/2 yr. old and 3 yr. old still drinking out of these....they have a few quirks but you deal with them and get used to it and LOVE, LOVE , LOVE the ease of use! I do,however, wash the liners sometimes to re-use or I'd be in bankruptcy...Publix and Walmart and other stores have liners you can use when the Playtex gets to be too expensive!
I rated this 3 stars because while it has many good parts, I was highly disappointed to "realize" when my baby was 4 months old that this set does *not* include any medium flow nipples. We used the slow flow for several months, so those were useful, but the Fast flow were way too fast and we needed something in-between.  Low & behold I walk down the aisle in Target looking for an entirely new bottle system and I see medium nipples that work perfectly for my daughter.  For trying to offer a variety of nipple options, Playtex missed the mark in omitting the medium flow nipple.
I'm so glad I chose the Playtex drop-ins system. It is so easy to use. I pump directly into the liners using the playtex storage set and freeze. Then I can just thaw and pop the liner onto the bottle holder and screw on the nipple. The selection of nipples was nice to have, though my guys would take any of them-he isn't picky. I haven't used the tall liners yet though, maybe that is more useful if you are formula feeding? For breastfeeding I recommend the pump and store set and you will be all ready to go!
Before I had my baby, I was thoroughly confused by all of the bottle options available. I started doing research & this one came highly recommended. Now I know why!!!! Hardly any cleaning!!!!! If you're not a complete germ phobe & not super messy while making the bottle, you rarely have to wash the bottles or rings. Just change out the drop in, wash the nipple & you're set. I've only had to wash the bottles or rings when I've accidentally gotten the formula on them. My only complaint is the "leak proof" lid. I only tried it once. Put the lid on the bottle & put the bottle in the outside side pocket of the diaper bag. Bag wasn't jostled or knocked around or anything & the bottle totally leaked. So, the "leak proof" tops are not leak proof. Still, I wouldn't use any other bottle.
Great set, but you'll need more nipples. At least 2 out of the 5 are Fast Flow, which I didn't use until my baby was 8-9 months old. The nipples are like $4 for a 2pk, so add that to the cost when comparison shopping.Other than that, I love these bottles! I don't have a single complaint about them. I do not use a bottle warmer. They do leak in the diaper bag when not kept upright, but I store mine upright, so that's a non-issue.
I got these as a gift at my baby shower, so I haven't had a chance to use them until now. Since I'm breastfeeding, I don't use them on a regular basis, just for outings. You can't pump into these, which is a bit of a hassle, but it's not too bad. My problem with the bottle is that the bags don't stay in. The ring doesn't hold the bag in, so when I went to feed the baby, he ended up soaked. Needless to say, bottle feeding that day was a disaster. If the bag would stay in, I'd say I really liked these. Unfortunately, I haven't had one bag stay in yet...
My daughter wasn't drinking out of the bottle. The laytex nipple was the only one shes takes. Its soft and is the most like a breast. But  I  didn't know why she wouldn't drink the bottle until I smelled the milk.  It had gone bad. So I learned that if you heat the milk ( not boil it) right after you pump then store it in good bags the milk stays fresh, and baby eats while i'm at work.  There is no better feeling for you (and grandma whos watching her)  when you know that shes happy while you are at work.
We got this set at our shower and haven't needed any other bottles. My son started using them at about four weeks old and quickly outgrew the smaller bottles, but the set includes three larger ones, which is great. The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is that they don't include the medium flow nipples, just fast and slow. My baby was impatient with the slow flow and overwhelmed by the fast, so we had to purchase the medium ones separately. It's also a little irritating to have to keep buying the drop-in inserts, but it does cut down on the dishes.
I only used these with my first child, now 7 years old.  I am pregnant with my 2nd and with certainty, will use these again.  Why they are amazing:1.  The liners are so convenient.  You use them then throw them away.  No bottles to clean (build up of disgusting old milk, especially on those long trips outside in the spring/summer), and you don't need a lot of bottles, I had two of each (2 x 4 oz and 2 x 8 oz bottles).2.  After mixing the formula or using expressed breast milk, simply squeeze the liner from the bottom of the open-ended bottle and all the air is out!  This lessens the gas and projectile vomiting.3.  Many options of nipples and they are the only thing you need to wash/rinse/sterilize.A lot of my friends use Dr. Brown and they rave about it, but after I talk about the Platex system, they are sold.
I love these bottles and I reccomend them to everyone I know. First off you drop in a liner and that means there is less to clean up, no scrubbing the inside of the bottle. Second after I put the cap on I pinch the nipple open and gently push up on the liner and all the air comes out. That means the bottle won't give the baby gas! I also used the natural action nipple which the baby loved. I was also able to wash the nipple, the bottle and the ring in the top rack of the disheasher in a speacial  nipple rack I bought at walmart for $5. No fuss and minimal clean up.
I bought these as burp cloths for my two boys.As burp cloths they are great - nothing fancy, just good at absorbing the spit up.  The fancy burp cloths are usually too flimsy (won't lay flat on your shoulder) and too thin to be helpful.  These stay in place without having to touch/fix it.I have tried them for cloth diapering but it seems they don't hold very well and leak more than the other diaper inserts I've used. I usually don't cloth diaper so I can't say too much on this - this is just from the few times I have used it.
I had these exact same burp clothes when I gave birth in 08 to my son so I figured with my second pregnancy I would buy them again big mistake they are made cheaper NOW you can see right through them I am going to have to fold them in half just so it will not go through on to my clothes I do not even think they will make it through a wash load what a disappointment they are worth maybe a dime each at best It is kinda hard to tell how thin they are unless you open the package I would suggest passing these up
These are by far the BEST burp cloths around.  I got several different kinds at my baby shower.  I ordered these after reading the reviews because the ones I received at the shower were paper thin.  These are fabulous.  I buy them for every baby shower I go to now.  The middle panel is very thick and helps with a newborn that spits up a lot and those breastfeeding blunders that happen to a new mom.  I highly recommend them.  They are worth the money.
I got 2 of these at my baby shower (one for upstairs and one for downstairs) and I absolutely love them! They steam pretty quick and I like how you can keep pre-measured water on it. When baby's hungry I just grab the bottle from the fridge, grab the little flask of water that's attached, pour it in, and press the button. I've had to warm bottles twice sometimes but it's still faster than warming water on the stove or running the bottle under the faucet. Oh, I only do 2 oz. bottles for now.
I have been using this product for almost 7 months and yes, its true the little cups DO NOT WORK for warming bottles, I tried them for 1 week until I started using my own cup and I just pour the water in and now I know about how long it will take to warm, works great for me. I never had a problem with scalding my baby's mouth because I always check the milk temperature on my hand BEFORE giving it to the baby. Overall, I live in a two-story house and this warmer is a lifesaver for those early am feedings, I definitely don't want to go downstairs to warm a bottle, the product works consistently if you figure out how much water you need.
I kept thinking I must be doing something wrong.  I'd read the directions again and try again.  Another, stinking, melted bottle!  And the milk would be scalding hot.  If it didn't melt the bottle, the milk would still be cold.  I also had a problem with my playtex ventaire bottles leaking from the bottom into the warmer.  Then I had the smell of burned formula in the kitchen.  Oh!  And it melted that bottle too!I'm going back to the old fashioned way.  I'm going to heat water in the microwave and let the bottle soak in it.  It is faster, less messy, and lots cheaper.  Don't waste your time and money.
This is an awesome product!  Once you get used to using this product, it is a huge timesaver.  It took us three tries to get the amount of water right so the bottle would be the right temperature (not too hot, not too cold).  Before going to bed every night, we put two bottles and the ice pack in the cooler section.  When the baby woke up, we transferred one bottle to the warmer.  It was usually done warming before we finished changing a diaper!  You may want to order an additional ice pack so you'll always have one ready in the freezer.  This bottle cooler/warmer makes it easier at night when you want to get back to sleep as soon as possible!
A dedicated steam warmer is definitely better than any other option such as a pan of water on the stove (takes too long) or the microwave (danger of uneven heating;  robs contents of nutrients).We have ours in a second-story nursery and have been pleased with it.  The only problem is that the results can be unpredictable - sometimes one capful of water will do the trick just fine, sometimes the bottle feels hot but the milk inside still cold, and sometimes it just goes to town and overheats the contents.  Nonetheless, I figure any heating process will be unpredictable, so I can't fault this model.The unit comes with adapters to hold any standard 4- or 9-oz. bottle;  we've used Avent with no problems.
I can't speak highly enough about this chiller/warmer.  Every night I know I will not have to go downstairs to get a bottle, warm it, and bring it back up while baby is crying.Now, all I do is take the bottle from the chill compartment (complete with ice pack), and place it, with a capful of premeasured water, in the warming compartment and hit a button.While I change baby's diaper, the bottle is warming, and I am ready to go.  This equipment has been a godsend.  Actually, I can't think of any equipment that I could live without less.No complaints whatsoever about this great bottle warmer.
We have tried many bottle warmers and this is the one we currently use. I liked it because it had a section to keep bottles cold as well. This feature sounds good, but in real life, doesn't work as well as it sounds.The bottle warmer works ok but the heating action is inconsistent even if you get the water level on the meniscus the same everytime. This isn't good for breast milk. Also the heating plate accumulates gunk from time to time.It includes a jar food holder to heat food, but we have never tried it.All in all a decent bottle warmer, but you have have to compensate with a re-heat or cold water sometimes.
This is one of my favorite products I have purchased as a new mommy.  I love it.  It warms the Avent bottles great.  It took some trials to determine how much water to add but now I have it down great.  You can over heat and then you will burn yourself if your not careful.  It is not like the negative reviews if you pay attention and use the right amount of water. It DOES NOT warm the Playtex Ventair bottles.  I guess because of the vent but I preferred the Avent bottles anyway.  The cooler DOES keep bottles cold for up to 8 hours if you remember to freeze the freezer pack each day.  We have a 2 story house and this helped us so much.  I have the other First year single warmer also and it is in my kitchen and it is great as well.  This is definitly worth the money!
Ehh, I bought this product to avoid my MIL using the microwave to heat bottles. The thing is that it really depends on the amount of milk and size of bottle. The warmer starts right away and creates a lot of steam. What i found is that a cold bottle from fridge would heat up a lot on the outside but a couple shakes and it would still be cold. I didnt find it evenly heated it through.Its still best to just sit it in hot water for a couple mins. :)But we will use this to keep cool bottles in the freezer pack in the back (remember to freeze the ice pack)-Overall, save your money and use the traditional method.
I use this everyday to heat up bottles.. I like how you can keep the frozen ice pack in with bottles to store and keep cool then just pour a little water into the front part to boil the water.  The directions are a little confusing with how much water to use, so i just have kind of learned how much water we need to use and just keep the bottle in there for 4-5 minutes.. you learn by trial and error.  Or if you want to save your money you can always just boil/microwave water and put the bottle in that.  I got this as a gift at my babyshower and I'm happy with it.
If you are pumping breast milk or formula feeding this thing is a lifesaver.  We've used this warmer for 2 of our babies and love it.  It's super convenient to have 2 bottles nice and chilled.  If you read the instructions the warming is pretty much fool-proof but on occasion I've been sleepy and overwarmed a bottle.  As I rule I always test the temperature anyway so it's never been a real problem.  Make sure your lids are off or loosened when you warm the bottles (especially Dr. Brown's) or the milk will come out of the top and make breast milk caramel all over the heating element.  :)
I purchased this bottle warmer for my second baby because it was a life saver for my daughter.  It stores 2 bottles in the compartment and comes with a small ice pack.  Do not store milk with this ice pack for more than eight hours.  The pack is fairly small and does not cool the milk for long.  I use a freezer pack and store one bottle at a time.  I would add a time chart just to know approximately how much time it takes to heat up a bottle.
The design is convenient, except for the water holding tubes which can be annoying to clip to the sides.  Otherwise, having a cooler right there is nice.  Note that it keeps the bottle COOL, and NOT COLD.  You can order replacement/extra ice pack on Tomy website - we keep 2 extras in the freezer as we constantly were forgetting to refreeze the one we had in preparation for a new night (they were $2 each).  Heating is a bit inconsistent and seems to be slower than the quick pro model by the first years.  Overall, good purchase and the price is great on amazon (you'll pay $30 at BRU)
Great product.  I use it at nights. It is a lifesaver when my son wakes up and needs his expressed milk instantly. Having the chiller compartment saves me the trip to the refrigerator. Sometimes I forget the ice-pack and will use a ziploc bag with crushed ice as an alternate.  As soon as I pop it in the chamber, by the time I am done changing him - it is ready to go.  I agree the measuring water is confusing so I just check it periodically to ensure the bottle doesn't overheat.  One thing to note is that it heats up glass bottles SUPER fast vs. the plastic bottles.  So if you need speedy turnaround use the Evenflo glass bottles - they heat up in under 3 minutes!
I can honestly say I love this bottle warmer because it is very convenient for those in a 2-story house.  We loved being able to keep the bottle cool and save the trip downstairs in the middle of the night.  Even when my son was sleeping through the night we still kept his morning bottle in his room and used this warmer to keep it cool.  But...I was very disappointed that my Dr. Brown's bottles were too wide for the warmer.  The taller Dr. Brown's bottle fit in the warmer but were too tall to fit in the cooler.  I ended up still using the cooler but storing the Dr. Brown's bottles in there without the nipple and cap on so they would fit.  My only suggestion would be to make the warmer wider so all bottles can fit.
I loved this product from the moment I got it. It works wonders with drop ins, And Avent bottles fit into and heat up nicely.... Sometimes that is. We have been using this with ourDr. Brown's Formula Mixing Pitcherand it was a life saver for awhile. Now All i can smell on our bottles is burnt milk from the heating plate.... Now I am not quite sure how the milk could possibly be getting onto it but it does apparently. We have been using it for about 3 months now almost every day, four- five times a day a most and it has considerably started to take longer and longer to heat up.. Before it was done and cooled off by the time the diaper change was over. Now we find ourselves sitting and waiting another minute or two for it to finish. The instructions are basically nonexistent. All in all it still works but I can slowly start to see it go down hill in its heating capabilities.
We bought this because I work 2nd shift at a hospital so on the days I work, I don't get home until midnight and my husband has to get up with the baby. We exclusively breastfeed, so it's not like we can just put warm water in a bottle and mix it with formula. Living in a two story house, it's not exactly fun to get up in the middle of the night, go downstairs, warm up the water, then the bottle and go back upstairs to the baby. This system alleviates all of that!! We just put it in our upstairs bathroom with a bottle of breastmilk in the cooler part and when the baby gets hungry, just put water in the wamer and warm the bottle. It's quick and easy, which is always good in the middle of the night!!Some people said they had problems with temperature, but we didn't have any problems. Just read the instructions for the type of bottle system we use and it worked fine!!!
The idea behind this design is well intentioned but I find the design aggravating. Subconsciously I always go for the handle to move this thing, but the handle is connected to the removable bottle storage piece. There's no other way to pick this thing up unless you grab it by the warmer cup. It may seem trivial but I like to keep this thing out of the way (it's an eye sore) and I would have rather just the bottle warmer with no bottle storage chamber.Plus, the heating is inconsistent. No matter whether you put extra water or not, the bottles still don't get warm like they should. When we first got it (4 months ago) the milk would actually be too hot. That hasn't happened in a while.
Our bed rooms are upstairs and I needed to have a second warmer and one which had a cooler.This is the best buy for the same reason.I simply love it and couldnt live without it.I have used it every single day so far .My son is now 5months and it works great I never timed how much time the bottle is in the warmer not I measured the water. I used to do it when I intially bought it but with a screaming infant in hands during night I stopped bothering about the measurements . even with such a rough use it still works great .never had a little problem with itBut I do make sure that I clean it throughly every week.The cooler part is awesome,saved me trips downstairs in the middle of the night.Being a working mom I am all about making things easy for me.This is what I recommend highly
We had this warmer with our first child, but had parted ways with it by the time we had another child. We got the Tommee Tippee bottle warmer with our second child (because we used the tommee tipped bottles with her). After only a few months, I have gone back to this warmer. I love that it has the auto-off feature (which the TT one did not have). heats the bottles very quickly and you don't have to stand over it checking the temp every minute like with the TT warmer. Overall, I love this warmer.
This product is a major piece of garbage. You will NEVER get your milk to the right temperature no matter how hard you try. It will either be cold or it will be scalding hot. Also it creates a smell that smells like burnt hair which is worrisome considering others who reviewed this product (at least 4 people) said that it catches on fire. We were using dr. browns 2 and 4 oz bottles and sometimes the 2 oz would be cold while the 4 oz would  be way too hot. We always ended up using the tap to correct the temperature and it took forever. We just bought the dr browns delux bottle warmer and its AMAZING! It remembers how long it takes to warm any particular amount and you dont have to fill it up with water every time the way you do with this. Remove from your registry, return, or throw away if you have bought this product and go with the dr browns instead.
I only used this pump for the first month as I did not produced much milk but it was great when I used it. As a first time mom, I found it very comfortable and easy to use. I also sterilized the pieces after a day of use and each piece came out fine. I did find that I had to bend forward to get maximum output but it was not uncomfortable. If you plan to do a lot of pumping then getting the double pump might be worth the extra money as it is quite time consuming with only one pump. Overall, an efficient pump, no complaints.
This pump says it's rated for only occasional use, but I used it every day for six months.  The main thing I like about this pump is the ability to use it in any situation.  My husband and I traveled quite a bit with our son and I was able to pump in the car with the battery pack.  I use it so much that I doubt it will make it to our next child, but it's much better to buy this one twice for $80 than to buy one for $350!
I purchased this pump for occasional use since I am a sahm.  As recommended by our lactation consultants, I pump once a day.  I sit in bed with my daughter nursing on one side and me pumping the other.  I am able to get 6-8oz in one sitting.  When I pump w/o nursing at the same time, I am still able to get 4oz in 15-20 mins. Being a sahm, I cannot justify spending the $200 for a double pump when I just don't need that much help.I highly recommend this if you are a sahm and can pump whenever for however long.  I pump once a day and after a week of that I have 2 weeks worth of feedings(if giving once a day).
It does the job, but does it make the loudest noise doing it.  My husband said it sounded like I was milking a cow.  I would have opted using a double breast pump, but it was much more pricier.  After two months I found that it was harder to express breast milk using the same suction as before.  I don't know why.  The pump was fine and working the same, even at the highest level, my breast would not fully be expressed.  I had to just ditch this item in the end.
I had this pump on my registry but then was also given a double electric pump (Medela Pump in Style) all I can say is GOOD THING I HAD THE DOUBLE PUMP! This single electric one just cannot get enough pressure/suction/whatever. plus even if it DID work, a single pump means double the pumping time. I know double electric pumps are expensive, but beg, borrow, get your family to go in it as a gift - you NEED it and this single pump is NOT an adequate substitute for a real pump! You can even rent a double pump from the hospital or a lactation consultant. Just don't bother trying this one.
This pump is decent but wasn't enough for me. I am home with the baby so I didn't think I needed one of the larger double pumps since I am not working. However, I needed to pump to improve my supply in the begining and also while I was healing from a cracked nipple and the single pump just didn't cut it. I ended up purchasing the Medela Pump-in-Style and it works much better. Now I use the double pump to fill an evening bottle for my husband to feed to the baby. It would take twice as long with the single pump. I REALLY hate pumping so it is worth everything to get it done in half the time! I think this pump is only worth it if you will rarely need to pump or to use for just a few minutes before feeding the baby to relieve engorgement.
I received this pump as a gift.  I like it because it is electric.  I got the manual attachment free from the hospital and it is very difficult to use even with the spring loading.  For manual use I recommend the Avent Isis.  However, there are times when I just feel like sitting down and not having to manually pump.  This works great.  It comes with storage containers and a nipple insert for smaller nipples.  Plus it comes with some lanolin just incase you get sore nipples.  It is a pretty good buy.  It doesn't work any better than a manual, but it is more convenient since you don't have to work as hard.  I wouldn't have bought it myself, but since it was given to me, I am glad to have it.  :)
I have the larger, double Pump In Style but I wanted to leave that at work and still have something at home.  I used this to pump in the morning before going to work or if I was unusually full.  It's small and light and perfect for travel.  I'm now onto baby #2 and use this occasionally since I'm now home full time, but this works so well when I need it.  It's efficient and has lasted through 2 babies - Medela is a really great brand!  I wouldn't recommend this if you're pumping often from both sides - get a double pump, but it was a perfect supplemental pump for me.
This gate was perfect for our split-level home with the addition of one 24&#34; extension. It does the job of keeping the baby away from the stairs and the dog out of where she isn't allowed. My husband said it was very easy to install. The stay-open and auto-close features are great. I plan on buying another for the bottom set of stairs.The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because I do feel like it could be slightly sturdier for the abuse my three-year-old tries to give it.
I'm quite happy with the gate, although I had to spend $250 to make it fit the bottom of my stairs. I removed the left 24" panel, replaced with an 8" extension, then inserted 3 more 8" extensions on the right.  The $30 8" extensions are way too expensive for what you get I think (and often arrive with scratches and rust due to the extra pole in the box).Like many Kidco gates, the instructions could have been better.  And it would be nice if the mounting hardware were metal instead of plastic.I used a 1/8" drill bit to create pilot holes before screwing into my banister (rather hard wood).  While it may be obvious to some to do that, others might not know, or might not know what size drill bit to use.  I tried a smaller one at first but the screw was extremely difficult to attach.  Only when I used a 1/8" drill bit did it go in.
We got *seven* extensions for this and put a fence across our den, marking off a one-hundred-square-foot area for the lil'guy to crawl around in. I was worried that the length would make it insecure, but it doesn't: Just be sure not to have the fence completely straight; use the nifty connection corners to alternate turns, using either angles back and forth or a serpentine pattern. Then hang stuff like toys, instruments, and mobiles from it. Our lil'guy loves it! :)
We bought this gate for a opening between our foyer and kitchen. We ended up buying one extension and are very pleased!!! We put it together in about 30 minutes. It's great because you can bend it into whatever configuration you need. For us, we were hesitant to drill into our walls but didn't have another solution. Now that it's installed, we definitely feel like the safety and convenience factors far outway the problem of drilling into our walls.  I definitely recommend this gate!!
I love this gate!  We have a spiral staircase that continues for 3 floors and it was almost impossible to block off on the second level.  This gate has solved all our problems.The door does not swing closed behind you, which I like.  The bar across the bottom of the door is very low compared to other gates, about an inch.  When the door is closed it is secure, much more so than our gate that swings shut behind you.  The entire system spans 72" and is very stable, even when my 1 year old shakes it.This gate is a great solution for difficult areas and is well worth the money.
I have this gate set up in two different parts of my house... one part as-is, and one part with two extensions. The gate that that has no extensions is very durable, and easy to open, however there is a bar that goes across the bottom of the "door", and myself and my guests are always bumping bare toes on it...ouch!In the other part of my house, I have this gate with two extensions. It's such a LONG gate, that there is no stability... the whole thing kind of sways, and my toddler finally was able to pull it out of the wall. There aren't many gates out there that will let you cover such a wide room, though, and for that it was nice while it lasted.
This is a great gate, and one of the few with the flexibility to accommodate non-straight spaces. It's pretty sturdy, the kids shake it sometimes but it hasn't ever opened or torn from the wall. The downside (or upside, depending on perspective) is that the gate is harder to open than the previous version. The magnetic catch is handy for a quiet but easy close. I got the extension, and it still stands pretty sturdy. No regrets on the purchase.BTW, this gate works really well as a separate space for an older child to play. We use it for my 3 year old to have a space on the main floor to play with toys without the baby able to interrupt. It's nice because he feels included with everyone else there, but doesn't get upset by his brother knocking down or taking his legos. Highly recommend for that purpose. Looks ok, good if you have white for trim, but ultimately, its a baby gate and looks like one.
We have used several other gates to block off the stairs in our home and have been frustrated with them all. My husband and I wish that we had ordered this gate a year ago! It was easy and quick for my handy husband to install at the base of the stairs. The gait opens easily with one hand (the trick is to pull the latch and then LIFT the gate just a bit, which we didn't know to do and initially caused us to think the gate was defective until reading the directions. This feature is nice as our toddler can pull at the latch but can't lift the gate to open it by herself). The gate is also fairly wide, allowing us to pass through it easily, even when carrying things. The gate automatically swings shut, which is convenient, but will also stay open if opened to 90 degrees. Would highly, highly recommend this gate!
I run an in-home daycare in a townhouse in addition to having my own young children.This gate is by FAR the sturdiest gate I've used and it is my absolute favorite.  I have 4 different baby gates.  We used it in a previous home to surround the fireplace but have it in use for keeping children in the playroom across a large doorway now.The gate is attractive, too!  I don't feel like I'm keeping the children "trapped" like with other gates.My only issue is that my oldest daughter figured out how to open the gate at the age of 2.  However, by then she understood and obeyed when I told her WHY she couldn't go through the gate.This gate is also taller than the average baby gate, which I love for my 12 month old climber.  She stacked pillows and climbed over the first gate I installed in that doorway.
We have used this gate since our oldest started moving around. Now 3 years and another child later it is still functioning great! It still looks and works as well as on day 1.We picked this for the top of our stairs so we could have a "landing" at the top. We did not like other gates where you have to balance on the top stair, with a baby in your arms, to open or close the gate.It is easy to open, but not for little ones. My 3.5 year old still cannot open this on his own.I would buy this same gate in a heartbeat.
We have been using this system for about two months now.  We have 2.5 walls in what was once our dining room (now play room).  We used 4-5 extensions as well.  We bought this new, and it was easy to set up.  Be sure you install it into the studs - infants will pull up on the railing.  Kidco is pretty easy to work with.  They sent me free "templates" for the wall and I bought some screws (for another gate).I LOVE this system.  The quality is great.  I recommend it and would purchase another if needed.
We have really enjoyed having this since my son was born.  We do not use the heartbeat or music setting, but he seems to like the other two settings which are more 'nature oriented.'  I love the automatic shut-off and the voice-activated modes.We have gone through one set of batteries already, but it took seven weeks to do so.  (That includes a few nights/naps that I forgot to press the automatic shut-off)  Overall this is a great product and very useful.
I wouldn't rate this as a baby necessity. It was nice to have at times, but our baby was never really addicted to it. I used the sounds as background noise when she was an infant, but not all the time. I was afraid she would get hooked on sleeping with white noise and wouldn't sleep any other way. The light was very helpful. I used that all the time for middle-of-the-night nursing sessions. It is very dim, so it is not bright enough to realy wake up baby (or you!) but you can see enough to avoid fumbling around.
When I first had this product, I used it on my daughter's crib like it is intended.  Then I realized it could also be placed on the side of the carrying handle on most infant car seats.  I found it worked great if my daughter was fussy in the car.  She loved the soft sounds and musical melodies.  It helped lull her to sleep.  The added light is also a great feature to peak on her rather than turning on the bright overhead light in my car.  Just make sure it is placed securely on the side of the handle to prevent it from falling.
I was a little woried about buying a metal crib, but because it was mutch cheeper than the wooden moddles I baught this one. I love it and so does my son. We have had it for over a year. It hs traveled with us, Surved as play pin, and iven was used as the main crib for 3 monthes while we have no room for a big crib. I do wish it were a little easier to fold and ajust, although the litle buttons are stuck in mine it still works and is very safe. Should offer maybe 1 mor hight? I like that the bottom of the ligs are removeable, the description doesn't say that.
I bought this because my daughter has hated the pack n play from day one. She is now 13 months old and it was a major battle at each travel destination. When we decided to leave her with grandma for a few nights we knew we needed a crib.  This one is great because it is very sturdy.  The folding locks take a bit of getting used to, but they work well.  The mattress is thin and we purchased a mattress for it for about $20.  I bought portable crib sheets at Babies R Us and they work great.  My daughter sleeps in this like her regular crib and I think we will get a lot of use from it! It does fold nice and flat, but it is still large for the average car. We can put it in our Suburban.  It would be nice if they made one that has sides that fold in half for storage, but no one does! I love this crib.
I purchased this crib after my son grew out of his Graco travel lite crib (at three months). My son is four months old now and fits in it perfectly and there is still a lot of room for him to grow. It is a nicely made crib and is worth the $80 that it costs. It is so cute and I love the fact that they sell a bedding set for it. We bought the malawi set for it, which looks adorable. I wish I would have gotten this crib from the begining.
great crib, easy to assemble (it was pretty much assembled when it arrived!) My 6 month old son who is almost 20 pounds fits well in it, but I had to double wrap a bumper pad around it so he wouldn't roll into the cold metal! I am not sure how long he will fit into it, but I love its portability and how I feel there is no rush to move my happy 2 yr old out of his crib. And its overall best feature is how you can roll it from room to room without taking it apart.
My husband and I bought this changing table in the "cherrywood". It wasn't hard to put together--my husband put it together in a 1/2 hr or so.  It provides ample space for diapers, burp clothes, blankets, and other items you may need on it.  The table comes with a simple foam mattress, which is easily wiped off with a cloth.  We've been using it everyday for nearly 16 months, and still good as new.  No problems encountered at all.
This is a good solid dressing table.  We received it because my in-laws found it at a consignment shop, so I can't comment about other reviewers' concerns regarding assembly.  The table serves the purpose and is a good value for those who don't want to spend a lot of money on a dressing table.  We didn't feel that we needed a fancy dressing table and instead opted to purchase a more expensive crib, which is really the focal point of the nursery.  The dressing table has two shelves that are quite convenient for holding supplies.  I placed baskets on those shelves to hold diapers, etc.
I purchased these covers because there doesn't seem to be anything else to fit the contoured changing pad.  Even after just one washing, the cover already shrunk.  I washed in cold water and dried on low since I had read the reviews saying they would shrink.  It didn't help, they still shrunk.  They still work though, but the corners of the changing pad are crumched down.  I don't see the problem with the straps either.  Mine are attached to the bottom of the pad, so there is no need for any slits for them.  Overall, these covers serve their purpose, and that's about all.  I would definitely suggest covering your changing pag with SOMETHING so that all the yuck doesn't get down into all the little crevices of the pad.  You might prefer covering the pad with a receiving blanket, so you can easily toss it in the washer with no worries when it becomes soiled.
I have had this from the day my daughter came home from the hospital and it has held up in the wash. No major accidents on it but the few there were are due to my not folding up the stinky diapers all the way or her spitting up. Washes well and never shrunk for me. If you are washing it on warm your water temp may be too high(hot water heater) so that may be causing it to shrink. I love mine and it is softer now then first use and it is secure so she does not slide like when we tried a towel on the changing pad.Have had the same 2 since February and look like new. Would have given this 5 stars but this is not as soft as I had hoped...maybe expecting alot from terry cloth.
I used this when I became too sore to use my electric pump.  The milk seeps under the pump guard and it leaks out from the edges onto clothes. I wouldn't even say getting this as a pump for when you're on the go is a good idea because the leaking milk will get all over leaving you with clean up. I had to buy a replacement part because the bottom part that screws on the base of the pump cracked from sterilizing (which it says you can do).  They don't sell just that one little piece so I had to buy the actual pump again as a part.  It cost nearly $30 to order this part and it took over 2 weeks to receive it.  The entire system just isn't durable or made for much use.  Also, cleaning down into the bend of this pump thoroughly is practically impossible.
This was about as thick as his cozy baby blanket. There was nothing &#34;UltraSoft&#34; or &#34;UltraThick&#34; about this mattress pad, if you could call it that. It's probably the first amazon purchase, after a couple hundred, that really left me disappointed. You're better off putting a thick, soft blanket under your baby's crib sheet if padding is what you're going for. As a mattress protector, it might be good. As a quilted pad to make it softer- it's useless. The packaging it came in is less than 1.5 inches thick if that gives you any indication as to how thin the entire thing can be folded up to. My 7 month old wouldn't have even noticed a difference. He naps SO well on our Tempurpedic with a down topper that I wanted to get him a little something to soften his mattress with now that he's older. Guess I'll have to keep looking.
When I opened the packaging I was appalled by the strong chemical smell of this mattress pad. I had to open the windows to get rid of the smell in the room even after I wrapped the pad back in plastic. I can't imaging my baby being in the same room with this product, let alone sleep on it! I also realized that there is no need to have a water proof mattress pad because most crib mattresses these days already come in a water proof cover. The non-waterproof cover I got was a much better choice for my baby.
This fits our crib mattress tightly and keeps our baby from sweating against the vinyl of the crib mattress.  We didn't have a mattress pad with our son and he would wake up soaking wet from sweating against the vinyl of the crib mattress.  The crib sheet alone wasn't enough to keep him from sweating.  This pad is also not too bulky so it doesn't cause a safety concern.  Just make sure the pad fits TIGHTLY on YOUR crib mattress for safety's sake.  We have a Sealy Crown Jewel Mattress and it fits great on it.
Look through the reviews and you can see many people upset about these leaking. They are correct! Because it only happens to one in about four or five reviewers, I think there must be a problem with production. Maybe some are leaky, some are not. Fact is, out of ten bottles, five of mine were leaky. I ended up throwing the whole lot out after using more money on paper towels than bottles.Save yourself the headache and get evenflo or playtex. They are half the cost and never leak
I bought a few Avent bottles when I was at a grocery store and had to have a bottle RIGHT then and this was all they had.  I was not disappointed in the quality of the bottle, but I was not overly impressed.  I did not notice a change in my son's spitting up using these bottles, either.The downside of using the Avent system is that, once you commit, you're really committed - the bottles and bottle parts do not fit standard bottles and parts.  I now have a wide variety of bottles and bottle parts, and the Avent bottles sit largely unused because I cannot mix and match the parts.  Who has time to search for the right parts when their baby is hungry and crying?
In the midst of all of my bottle testing, I was against Avent, mostly because they do cost a bit more than most bottles.  I thought that I could test a bottle and cup, to see if Avent was really telling the truth when they said all the parts were interchangeable.  Well, they are.  They also have more nipple selections, depending on how fast your child drinks.One thing I wish Avent has was a design or something on the bottle. I did find that if you buy the Evenflo Cool Pals 9 oz. cup holder, these fit in them great.I would suggest only getting 2 packs of these, couple of Magic Cups with handles and some extra spouts (have at least 2 green ones and 1 white one).
These bottles are a good choice if you're breastfeeding, but have to introduce a bottle. My son has never had a problem going from the breast to this bottle and back to the breast again.Also, after months of frequent use, I have never experienced the leaking problem with these bottles mentioned by some other reviewers. I also know of other moms who have used these for more than a year and no leaks either. I have even taken the tops apart and put them back together and still no leaks.
I used these bottles with my first son and would have given them about 3.5 stars. I would be the first to tell you if they were not fixed just right they would leak. After trying all others once again with my daughter I decided to use these. When I went to buy new nipples I noticed they looked different. Oh, wow, what a diffrence. Baby is 4 months old and no leaks. The new nipples have a raised edge that guarantees the nipple is tight in the collar. Then there is a lip that hugs the rim of the bottle to guard against leaks. The REALLY great thing is you can tighten these bottle to your hearts content. I tightened it as tight as I could and it didn't leak a bit. The new nipples have the words "Extra Soft" on the package and if you look closely they look different around the bottom. I am extremely satisfied with these bottles now and will use them untill baby is weaned.
I purchsed these bottles on a recommendation from a friend who was breast feeding as well.  The fact that the nipples were to more mimic the breast than others was great and the fact that you could use the bottles as storage containers when pumping was even better.  When I first had my daughter, we had to put her on a bottle a week after she was here to help me have time to heal.  She was getting one bottle a day and was having no problem going back and forth from breast to bottle regularly.  The nipples are great because they force the baby to suck on them as if they were the breast.  The nipples are not supposed to be shaped as the breast but force the baby to latch the way they do on the breast.  I swear by these bottles ans will not change to any other bottles for her!
These are the widest bottles that I have seen available.  They are well made and easy to assemble.  I sterilise mine every day and there has been no fading of level markers (a problem with another make I tried.) or discolouration of bottles.  They come with a whole range of accessories like handles and sippy cup teats for older babies and so will go from Day 1 right through to when you no longer need sippy cups.  The best thing for me is the fact that you can get specially designed teats that allow for thicker liquids (my son had rice in his milk at 8 weeks (with Doctors approval) because he is so big (90th Percentile) and was so very hungry.  The Adjustable Flow teat has a slot cut instead of a hole and so the flow depends on the way the teat is lined up with the babies nose.  What a fantastic idea and such a godsend for us.  They also hook up directly to an avent breast pump either the manual or electric.
HI, I HAD THESE BOTTLES BACK IN 2002 WHEN MY SON WAS BORN BECAUSE THE HOSPITAL GAVE THEM TO US TO USE TO FEED THE BABY. I HAD NO PROBLEMS BUT WHEN I BOUGHT MORE WHEN I GOT HOME, I HAD NOTHING BUT LEAKY PROBLEMS!!! I EMAILED AVENT 2 TIMES AND THEY TOLD ME FIRST THAT I HAVE TO CALL THEM TO "TALK ABOUT IT" I SAID FORGET IT AND THEN I COMPLAINED AGAIN WHEN THE LEAKING KEPT HAPPENING. THEY SAID THAT I WAS NOT PUTTING THE NIPPLE AND RING ON CORRECTLY. THEY TOLD ME TO ONLY TURN THE RING UNTIL U FEEL IT JUST ATTATCH TO THE BOTTLE AND DO NOT OVER TIGHTEN. I TRIED THIS AND YET AGAIN THE BABY WAS SOAKED!!! MY POINT OF WRITING ABOUT THIS NOW IN 2005 WHEN I USED THESE BOTTLES IN 2002 IS THAT I CANNOT BELEIVE THIS PROBLEM HAS NOT BEEN CORRECTED YET!!! WE THINK WE HAVE ANOTHER BABY ON THE WAY AND I KNOW THAT WE WILL NOT, NOT, NOT, BE GETTING AVENT BOTTLES!!!
i have zero complaints about these bottles. wish i had bought them in the first place (i started out with the playtex nurser system). they may be pricy compared to other bottles, but, you don't have to buy liners for these bottles. my daughter found these bottles much easier to hold herself than the playtex ones and these have a bigger selection of nipple flow to choose from (besides slow and fast, where fast for playtex really just means not so slow), so i put them away and got more of these, and my daugher was a much happier baby.what i found with the leaking some people complain about: if there is any liquid in the seal it will leak. this problem can easily be solved by wiping the inside of the ring that holds the nipple and the outside rim of the bottle with a dry rag, and if it squeaks when you screw the lid on, you're not going to have any leaks.hope this helps!
In 2000 when my first son was born, I bought the Avent bottles to go with my Isis breast pump (which I LOVE) because everyone raved about how they were the best.  The first time my son tried the bottle with a newborn nipple he couldn't get anything to come out.  After trying for awhile, I finally called Avent and they told me to move up to a different size nipple.  These bottles worked out relatively well after that dilemma.  With me second son I assumed I would use the bottles again and tried the newborn nipple with the opposite result.  The flow was way too fast for him and he would choke and spit out half the milk every time I would try to feed him. I finally gave up on Avent bottles and went with the much cheaper and economical Evenflo Classic bottles (on the recommendation of the lactation consultant.)
In my opinion the Avent bottle system is superior to any other product on the market. The disposable system works great for storing and freezing milk and it's convenient for Mom's on the go. My only mistake was not buying enough bottles in the beginning when my son ate eight times a day. The bottles are designed to reduce gas, and seem to do the job. The one slight annoyance with the system, you have to place the ring on the lids directly on top of the nipples; otherwise the bottle has a tendency to leak.F.Y.I. - I purchased the adjustable flow nipples when my son turned three months old as recommended, but nowhere in the product information does it tell you that you are supposed to line-up the Roman numerals of the nipples directly in line with your baby's nose to adjust the flow. This makes sense of course, but I had to call the 1-800 number to discover this 'little' detail.
I decided to use these because I wanted the Avent Breast Pump and would use these with it.  Well, my newborn had a hard time latching onto the nipples and when he did they were way too fast with the flow.  He would choke and gasp almost everytime.  I now use the Playtex Ventaire bottles and he doesn't have as much of a problem.  Every baby is different, though, but if you have a baby that tends to want to eat quickly, these won't work so well.
My daughter was born 3 & 1/2 weeks early and had to stay at the hospital for a week, she was lazy at the breast but did great with these bottles which came highly recommended by a friend.  I only have an ocassional problem with leakage when you twist it shut it seems that every 1 in 10 times it leaks.  I don't mind the leaking except that it takes several tries to re-twist it before it stops leaking.  I hate losing precious breastmilk to leaks, thats why I gave it only 4 stars.
These bottles are pretty good.  The nipple is a little large and seems to flow kinda fast for my breastfed baby.  She makes quite a mess while drinking from these.  However, the bottle is nice and durable.  The nipple and caps fit snug.  Also, they work great as breast milk storage containers.  You can take out the nipple and put the insert in the cap for freezer storage.  I like that.  My daughter doesn't get a bottle often, but when she does this in one of the types I use.
I've only tried the 9oz bottles and they leak for me alot. It's really annoying since I spent so much money thinking that they were quality. They also make alot of noise when my son eats. And he doesn't like the nipple, it's too thick for him to get a good suction. One thing that is good is these bottles don't give him gas which I've tried cheap bottles and he gets gassy with them. After trying alot of bottles the only brand I have absolutely no problem with is the Dr.Brown bottles. They are just the best. But they have extra parts to clean which is a pain.
We recieved these bottles as a gift for our son (now 16 months)and expected greatness from Avent. When I opened the first package I was amazed at how stiff the nipples were that are included with these bottles. Stiffness is hardly a correct simulation of the breast. The bottles are also very wide and hard for little hands to grip when they begin to hold their own bottles. I also saw no indication that my son got any less air from using the Avent system. I MUCH prefer the softer, easier to hold, less air producing Playtex Nursers which is what we ended up switching him to.
I absolutely love ALL Avent products... their bottles, bottle-warmer, pacifiers, etc.Both of my boy used the Avent bottles, and the ones my first-born used are still being used by my second one. Yes, sometimes there is a slight leak when shaking... I found that is from formula powder getting stuck between the nipple and the bottle, and breaking the seal. So, when it happens I just wipe the rim of the bottle, take the nipple out of the ring, rinse the nipple and ring, and then the problem's gone. These bottle seem virtually indestructible to me, and haven't discolored with age of anything. (Although, old nipples do discolor.)It's hard to believe my mom gave me bottles with little bags in side... what a pain and mess that must have been!!!
We used Avent bottles for several weeks, but our baby was spitting up _all the time_, seemed like she was choking during feedings, and had gas all the time.  We switched to the Playtex VentAire bottles when she was 6 weeks old, and problem solved! No more crying from gas, she hardly ever spits up anymore, and she has a much easier time at feedings.  The flow is slower and it really does cut down on the amount of air she takes in during feedings.  So, I highly recommend trying something other than the Avent bottles for small infants.  Maybe later, when our baby is a bit older we'll pull out the Avent bottles again, but for now, we aren't using anything except Playtex VentAire.
when i became pregnant i planned on using these bottles, i bought everything bottle warmer,sterilizer,breast pump, and a ton of bottles and nipples. well 2 weeks into using them i threw them out the window. my daughter had  very bad gas. when i switched bottles the gas stopped. Plus the bottles are  expensive......you  have to keep buying new  nipples there are sooo many different sizes. a waste i think, most bottles have 2 fast or slow but there seemed to be 4 different sizes or more.
I am breastfeeding currently but I do like to leave the house every so often. When I get the chance I'll pump directly into one of these bottles using the Isis pump. I love the nipples of this bottle because they are the most like the human nipple and my baby has not developed nipple confusing because of this. One thing that all Avent users should know...if you read the directions carefully for the pump, the makers tell you not to use anti-bacterial soap on any of their products. Doing so can cause the plastic to crack. I just wash all the parts as directed using regular dish soap and then sterilize all the parts using the Avent sterilizer. That too is convenient and easy to use.I would recommend these bottles to any woman who is breastfeeding and will have to return to work. Yes, they cost more than most bottles, but if you can afford that little extra you will be very pleased with the results.
I admit it: I am impressed with Avent bottles! They are easily one of the baby products capable of handling extremes without a blink. Example: microwave sterilize them and after a couple of minutes, pour a stream of recently boiled water; mix with formula and put next to the ice bin in the freezer for five minutes. Do this with your average bottle a few times and be ready to say bye-bye to them, but Avent bottles hold on strong and in the process also happen to offer the best bibs in the market (the ones that best mimic the nipple, thus giving your baby the least gas, if you feed the bottle perpendicular to his/her mouth). No wonder they've been voted among the best baby products for several years in a row!
I bought a bunch of these bottles because many people have recommended them to me.  My son HATES them.. the nipples are too hard for him and it takes him forever to get anything from them..  He wears himself out sucking on them.  I finally switched to the gerber comfort hold bottles which he loves.  They are similar but have softer nipples.  My son is no longer cranky from not getting enough formula. I know alot of people love them, but my son doesnt.  I never had a problem with leaks however as some people said.
I understand that some people might have a problem with this bottle type. If you screw the top on crooked at all or too tightly - you may have issues. But if you take a second and make sure that you are screwing on the top properly - you might have a leaking bottle once every 30 or 40 tries. I have used 4 of the other top brands and am very pleased with Avent. The Brownies are really good too - but just too hard to clean on a regular basis. If you only use a bottle once in a while - use browns - but if you use them a lot - get Avent. Only way to go.
This brand of bottles was recommended to me by a certified lactation specialist when I was having trouble with low breastmilk supply and was forced to supplement.  It was extremely important to me to be able to still feed my baby by breast and I was afraid that introducing a bottle to my daughter would cause her to lose interest in me.  I was told that this brand of bottles was created to closely imitate the breast and this is the only brand that you can easily switch baby back and forth from breast to bottle.  And it has worked wonderfully--my baby girl will feed from both without any problem.  I love the shape of the bottles--very comfortable to hold--and they are extremely easy to clean.  Out of the four 4 oz size bottles I own, one of them has a leaking problem, but I can usually solve it by loosening or tightening the cap.  My daughter has no problem sucking from the nipple, as one person reported.  These bottles are great!
I choose these bottles because they are very popular but then realized that the size of them are so large that the baby never really seems to be able to get a good hold on them. I started bottle feeding at 6 months and ended up having to switch and buy an entire new line. After my son turned 1 began to wean him off the bottle and introduced the avent bottles again just to see if he could hold it and it was still way to large for him..... I guess these bottles would work if you plan on bottle feeding a toddler with big hands
Unlike a couple of reviews I read, the only times I've had problems with the Avent bottles leaking is when I screwed the cap on badly or had the nipple in wrong.  Otherwise, they are perfect.  We were told that there may be &quot;nipple confusion&quot; if a baby goes from back and forth from breast to bottle but we haven't had a problem whatsoever.  These nipples are enough like the breast that he does just fine.  (His mouth is open wider than other bottles because he puts the whole nipple in his mouth, like the breast.)  I also use (and love) the Avent breast pump so you can pump right into the bottle and attach a nipple.  It couldn't be easier.
I used these bottles with my son and loved them!This bottle system was excellent and my son almost never had any gas with them like he did with some others I tried out.  He took right to them as a newborn and I didn't have to encourage him like I had to with others.The wide mouth is so nice and makes them so much easier to wash.  The nipples and bottles are extremely durable and held up for a very long time.  As my son got older, I had other bottles I would use for him, but he always preferred the Avent ones.I never had problems with leaking like I had read about, so I don't know much about that.  But there was absolutely no leaking here!There is a great range of accessories that go with this bottle as well, including sterilizers and breast pumps.  Everything was compatible with my Avent breast pump and it made it a dream to use.I am pregnant with my second and Avent is all I am going to buy for her.
I absolutely love these bottles!!  I've been using them for about 4.5 months now and I've NEVER had a problem with leaks!!!!  I have also never overtightened the bottles!!  I love how they are designed.  Because of their width, my daughter was able to hold them at 3.5 months!!  I also love their 'wide-neck', which makes it very easy to fill the bottle while holding a squirming baby!  They are also EXTREMELY easy to clean!  And they are interchangeable!!  I plan on buying the sippy cup spout in a couple of months so that my daughther can learn to drink from a sippy cup using the same bottle!!! My daughter has also never had colic!! I LOVE EM!!! I LOVE EM!!! I LOVE EM!!!  I also have the breast pump and microwave sterilzer which all fit the bottles perfectly!!
these dont require that extra ring to make it leak proof. i had the originals and they work great too but i like the big capacity but not big size of these. they will leak out of the nipple if it is upside down so if your baby feeds themselves, watch that they dont drop it and wedge it somewhere upside downupdated review***** i love avent NATURALLY bottles and trusted that is what i was getting when i looked at all 12 customer photos. well i broke these babies out to use em last night and they are reg avent bottles with the stupid ring on the inside that makes it not leak(something not needed in the other bottle)the plastic used is also completely different. it isnt the hard clear plastic that doesnt cloud or stain, it is the dull non see through plastic that feels pliable. and the oz numbering on these reg bottles is the kind that will scratch and rub off easily. so disappointed that i now have to return these :(
I love these bottles.  My Amelia is hardly every gassy with them.  As for the leaking issue, it is Not the bottle, it's the user!Bottle use de-mystified: you MUST  make sure that the top of the bottle and its threads are DRY and the flange of the nipple on the inside is dry as well.....then when you tightly screw on the cap it should make a soft squeak sound that perfects the seal. If either are wet or have milk on them (like when you open it to re-fill a partially full bottle) you must re-dry the threads and nipple before screwing closed. Motto: "IF you don't hear a squeak, it's gonna leak".  Good luck.
Baby is breast-fed and I registered for these so I could pump and my husband could feed her at night.  Our baby hated the bottle and wouldn't take the nipple.  The nipples, on the Avent, are too long and hard and would make her gag when she attempted to latch on.  We switched to the Platex NaturalLatch and now she takes a bottle.  The nipples on the Platex are much softer and shorter.  Baby switches between the bottle and breast now, no problem.
I found the nipple to be way too hard for my newborn son to suck.  I then ran out and got the Munchkin Tri-flow.  You can change how fast the milk flows out of the bottle as you baby grows and the nipple is much softer!Munchkin also sells just the nipple that is compatable with the Avent bottle.  So, if you've already purchased the avent bottles your money has not gone to waste!  The only problem is that the Tri-flow is still fairly new and is very hard to find!  Good Luck!
The Avent brand of bottles is an outstanding product.  For those experiencing leaks, it is simply because the bottles are an interlocking system and must be screwed on properly.  I have had no problems using these bottles, and yes I have experienced an occasional leak which I notice while I'm shaking the bottle because I have not screwed the cap on properly.  These are well worth the price paid.  I have tried both Dr. Brown's and Playtex VentAire and find the Avent products to be superior to both of these.  Highly recommended by this mom!Update March 06:  one more great feature about the Avent bottles -- they sell a sippy cap that can replace the nipple, so your investment goes into toddlerhood with no need to buy additional sippy cups!  They are leakproof, and come in a 2 pack just as the replacement nipples do.  I have found them in Toys R Us, since my local Babies R Us does not carry them.  Still a great product in my book!
I have to agree with reviewers, the nipple of the Avent bottles is great. It's obvious watching my baby that he latches on similar to the way he does on the breast.The problem is that the bottles leak like crazy. My little guy ends up wearing as much milk as he drinks. I've tried all of the suggestions, but have had no success in making the bottle leak proof. I've had to go out and buy different bottles with nipples I don't like as much just so that I don't have the mess.
Avent bottles are one of the best out there. Handy and easy to clean. They protect your baby from getting gas while he eats. But if your baby is really gasy and has colic, I recomend you the Dr brown bottles. I suggest you buy or register for both (avent and dr brown)so if your baby does ok with gas and colic you use avent, and if not, you use dr brown (at least for a while). You will notice the difference in a few weeks. But I most tell you avent work very well with gasy babies, so if you dont want to invest too much  money in bottles, avent will do great.
We've been using these bottles since our son was 1 week old, and they work great. He had no problem with nipple confusion switching between this bottle and the breast. We've had no problems with leaking, and I love the fact that you can convert the bottles to sippy cups later.One note for breastfeeding moms -- your baby may be able to use the #1 nipple for much longer than a formula-fed baby, since it more closely resembles how the milk comes from you. So wait before buying #2 & #3 nipples, because you may not need them!
A lactation consultant recommended these bottles to me. I bought one to make sure my baby liked it before buying more. I didn't want to hassle with the disposable liners. I feel my baby doesn't swallow as much air. A lot of babies are gassy and I wouldn't blame it on the bottle.  I also like the idea of the different sized nipples to adjust the flow.  I have only used size 1 because we need her to slow down; she eats to fast and gets a tummy ache.These bottles also fit perfectly in my bottle warmer (the first years) excellent choice!
I have been using nothing but these bottles for the first 6 months of my baby's life. Yes they WILL LEAK if you don't pull the nipple all the way through. But that is an easy fix! I never had an issue with my baby falling asleep during a feeding or the flow being too fast. And colic has never been a problem here either.I breastfeed and pump for my baby and I found that she went easily from bottle to breast as early as 2 weeks old. I attribute it to the unique design of the nipple which encourages her to open her mouth wide instead of tucking her lip in to suck on a smaller nipple.Also these can be converted to sippy cups. They are very durable as well and so easy to clean. I threw all the other bottles I got as a shower gift right out in the trash - my baby will not drink from them.
I really like this pump.  Works great sort of a pain to clean but easier than having to clean tubing on an electric.  The bottles however are junk.  After one use they leaked from under the plastic disk.  EVERY bottle I have leaks.  In order to stop it is a pain.  I pull up on the nipple and roll it around clockwise to make sure it's in there right, then I use a rubber gripper and tighten the crap out of it so it won't leak.  What a PAIN!  I sold my lot on ebay and replaced them w/ the Playtex vent air.  I did save one bottle so I could pump into it though.
My daughter was in the NICU the first day of her life, and then the special care nursery the next few days, so I had to use the hospitals electric medela dual breast pump to express milk. i returned home and rented the medela for a month and hated it. It HURTS my nipples. My friend got me this Isis breast pump kit and I tried it. I LOVE it! I used it since my daughter was about 2 weeks old. I doesnt hurt my nipples like the electric breast pump does as I can control it with every squeeze. It doesnt hurt my wrist (as one might think.) I only supplement my daughter with one bottle of EBM at night. It takes me 10-15 minutes and I can express 5 ounces with this pump! I LOVE IT!Oh, and it is virtually silent so I can pump one breast as I breast feed my daughter on the other!!!
I mostly use the Ameda electric, but used this on a weekend trip and was very pleased with the milk volume.  I get most of the milk in just a few minutes and the one hand operation is simple.Drawbacks: it can be tricky to get the suction going, but little pumps at first followed by long slow pumps will eventually get it. Also, I've found that I can still get milk out with my electric even after I'm done with the Isis.  It is a little higher maintenance to clean, but I still recommend it.
It's a great manual pump, but it's just a manual pump after all. Manually pumping both breasts one at a time takes more than twice as long as double electric pumping to get the same amounts of milk. It would be impossible for me to keep pumping at work if I had to take that much time out of every work day. However I do keep this pump in my desk drawer for emergencies (like the time I forgot my other pump at home) or for out-of-office meetings (because it's small and discrete). It's also great for occasional home use or for women who need to leave the house with a pump every once in a while. I'm giving it 4 stars because I don't think it should be advertized for use at a full time job.
This is a great pump. I haven't had any issues with it. I pump constantly as my son is very finicky as to when he wants a bottle or a breast in his mouth.  Easy to use and clean. The carrying case is great for when I go back to work and it can also be used as a carrying bag for keeping milk/formula cold when you go out.  While I love the pump I am not happy with the Avent Bottles. They can leak easily if you over or under tighten the bottle.  Let me tell you at three in the morning you dont' want to worry about that stuff.  You want to get a nipple on and feed.  I recommend the pump but not their bottles.  Sometimes if I put down the pump on the bed and it tips a bit I get spillage from where the pump connects to the bottle.
I based my decision to purchase this pump based on all the reviews it got.  However, it takes me about 20 minutes to pump 4 ounces.. on a good day!! Luckily, I have an awesome boss, who allows me all the time I need to pump.. I average 2-3 ounces every hour and half.. at 20 minutes at a time.. which is rediculous. If I could, I would purchase an electric pump, because as my baby grows, I don't see how I'd be able to catch up to her growing appetite using this pump, and not spend my whole day in the bathroom pumping.  On the plus side.. all the litle extras it came with are great, and the case is discreet and keeps the bottles cold for a few hours.
I had NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO idea..!!! I only recieved this pump - no electrical one and I wanted 2 diiiiie! I was in pain for days after I gave birth,irritable because of the lost of sleep and trying to conform to the babies temporary sleeping pattern. I had a low milk supply and breastpumping for 1 hour for only 4ounces - this was not a joke! I wanted 2 diiiie I tell you.. I would finish pumping and da baby would be getting up for a feeding... NOooooo! already, I would think... yes and with only 4 oz to show. Here I go with the stupid MANUEL pump... NO.. I NOW know better.... electronic and a good brand- so what you pay 300. and change its worth your sanity, sleep, time, energy and appreciation for the bond with the baby. My milk supply in time grew (not soon enough) I am still nursing and again the manuel pump and I did NOT have a good relationship. We started off badly
I read all the reviews on this pump but still wasn't convinced about buying this pump. I originally purchased a Gerber pump and it worked until it cracked. I asked a lactation consultant what kind of pump she'd recommend and she recommended Avent and Medela. I needed a pump in my price range so I chose the Avent.I like how the suction mimics a baby's latch but milk gets stuck everywhere and it leaks all over the place. The pump also makes an annoying squeaking noise and sometimes I lose suction. I'd recommend this pump over Gerber though. I will give it credit though, it's a lot easier to take apart and clean.
Although I haven't been using this pump for very long, I've been able to get very good results. Of course, pumping takes practice but this pump works great for beginners. It is very easy to set up and clean...making it easy to take along. I also like that the bottles fit onto the pump-nothing extra to buy (and clean). I also have an electric pump but prefer this pump when I am home during the day. I find that I can more quickly get it ready and am able to pump one side as soon as my baby is finished nursing on the other side. I definitely recommend having a manual pump, even if you plan on or already have an electric.
If you are only going to be pumping once in a blue moon, then this is a great pump for you.  I found it to be an incredible nusance, so I borrowed a friend's Medela electric pump.  Never used this Back to Work pump more than twice after using hers!  Why spend a longer amount of time pumping that you have to (and yes it does take longer even though the manual says their stats say otherwise).  With our next child, I will definitely be buying electric!
The Avent pump in this kit is very good. I also like the carrying bag, which is subtle and good for work - it can even be used as a lunch box when you are done breastfeeding.However, the nipples in this kit are very hard and the speed on the slow flow was far too fast for my newborn (when I tested the milk on my wrist, I didn't get a drop - it squirts). There are better bottles out there too, that keep the baby from getting too much air. Instead of the Avent bottles, I have started using the Playtex nurser system - which means I pump into the Avent bottles and pour them into the nurser (the Playtex system sells a kit with a pump adapter - but it does not work with Avent). This has worked fine for me, though if I were not pumping at work I would not pay the extra money to have the kit. Since I pump at work, the insulated bag is helpful.
I had this pump with my first child back in 2003 and I worked great for when I was at work but it was messy. The milk always seemed to leak out underneath the plastic insert, so I took that out and it helped a little bit. I also had probably with the pump maybe working a little TOO WELL and would stimulate my "let down" and so it was a panic to keep myself from wetting my shirt on the other breast I wasn't pumping, while I kept pumping and answered phones! I was a night receptionist so I just pumped away while working.I like that it comes with a bag that is nice and stylish. I saved this and I will use it with my next baby due in Sept. 2009.
After trying a dual electric pump that was very uncomfortable for me I tried the Isis berast pump and never looked back. I could not control the suction with the electric pump and,  however with the Isis I was able to control the pressure and was able to completely empty both breasts in less than 20 minutes total. The cushioning made the pump very comfortable. And my hand never got tired from manually pumping. I used this product years ago with my daughter and I am adding it to my registry for my second child. I highly recommend this for anyone who would like to continue breast feeding.Follow-up: My youngest daughter is now six weeks old and I still love this pump. Its a moust-have for breastfeeding mothers.
My friend gave me her pump when she was finished with it, I just boiled all the parts, and then threw them in the dishwasher.  Anyway, the pump is fine for a bottle, I only use it once in the day, but during the pumping time it will lose it's suction or you have to get it on just right before it will really get the milk quantity you want.  It took me about 4 times (4 days) to figure out  how the pump suction needs to be for myself.The other complaint I have with the pump is the parts that screw together to make the pump complete come unscrewed throughout the pump time.  (the bottle, and the other screwed on piece to the pump.)  This is really anoying while you're trying to pump.Overall it's ok, but I think I can find another one.
This a necessary item. I hated to have to cover my coffee table and have my house look baby proof(I even avoided it for a while) but after two big bumps i bought this item.Its easy to install and I like that I could cut it to the size i needed. It came with the corners which is great. The tape it uses is perfect because it really stays put. My baby has tried to pull at it and it doesn't come off.This color is light enough that doesn't call too much attention in my living room.
I would have been okay with just the table corners. I have a glass table and I was worried about my 1-year-old niece visiting.The corners helped a lot as did putting a tablecloth over my table. There was no way the table guard was going to work around my glass table even with the tape included though. It's for a much thicker table and my glass table was too thin.Also, my niece is still crawling so the guard wasn't necessary. Even when she stood up, she couldn't reach the table and she was safe as houses in her booster seat and high chair.
The instructions that came with this are terrible. The diagrams are really tiny and have no labels. The written instructions for Step 1 say "see the diagram" and do not elaborate, making the instructions worthless. The 3M sticky tape is REALLY sticky. Do not expect to get it off your furniture or to reuse these edge guards - the tape will cling to your furniture and to the guards, destroying both.In the end I was unable to install my guards properly - they attached to the furniture crookedly and then I couldn't un-stick them in order to make it right. The guards are nice, thick foam, but that doesn't matter if the installation goes miserably.You can see my photos of the final results I got in the Customer Image Gallery.
I just put this up yesterday and was glad I did. My daughter been using the coffee table to pull her self up to stand and also been crawling through it to play with the stuff underneath. Just right after I put it on she was doing that! She even bumped her head on the edge! Thank god this was on so she was fine!Not sure how it would work on a walking/running baby into corners/edges. But this seem to be doing well. It's nice and thick.The tape that came with it isn't that sticky though. It makes it easy to stick and restick back on so you get it on good. But at the same time, I fear my daughter would figure out that she can pull it off.I'll see how that goes but so far I'm content with this.Cutting the roll itself seems a bit annoying. because I can't seem to get a STRAIGHT edge using a scissor.
The title says it all...the edges of the bumpers were very tempting for my daughter to peel every chance she got. You'd think her ability to remove the ends of the bumpers would indicate the bumpers would be easy to remove.They were a nightmare and have ruined our beautiful coffee table. I've tried goo gone to no avail. If anyone has any tips how to get the tape off, which is coated with random pieces of foam from the old bumpers, I'd love to hear them. I can't believe how awful my table looks.
I needed a solution for a sharp tile step down into my living room- every time I stepped down I envisioned my baby cracking her skull on that :( I was hesitant to buy this, though,  because I was skeptical that it would stick and chocolate seemed like the wrong color to match my tile. It sticks really well- we'll see how it holds up over time- and the color looks great against my taupe tile. It really doesn't look cheesy at all. We're going to use the corner pieces on a table of mine and I've already checked the color there too. Not great against some sort of reddish brown wood, but miles ahead of the hideous Safety 1st Expandable Table Edge Bumper. This stuff gives a perfect fit since it's cut to fit. The expandable thing doesn't fit the sizes listed (no way it will work on a 90 inch table) and it looks like a pair of hand-me-down training pants from the 1970s.
Other reviews have said that this product is difficult to cut, but I used a pair of ordinary scissors and didn't have any problem whatsoever. Also, the foam is a bit stretchy, so your measurements don't have to be exact. I cut the foam a bit short and then just stretched it to fit. While it's true that the tape won't last forever, it is also true that it won't leave a mark on your furniture once you want to remove it permanently. Simply apply more double-sided tape when the adhesive breaks down. Easy!
I purchased this for the breakfast nook around my marbel countertop.  Since I don't have kids yet (we are adopting) I can't really comment about the durability.  However, they seemed to stay on tight when I applied the tape to the top and bottom on the inside of the foam.  If not I will do what some of the other posters suggested.It wasn't difficult to cut the foam to length.  I just started with one corner edge, measured the long foam piece, and then cut the foam with scissors (just alittle bit longer then what I though I needed.  It cut slightly jagged, but since I cut on the long side adjusting it wasn't a problem.  The finish product doesn't look funny or leave any gaps at all.
I used this table edge and corner guard to edge a window in my son's playroom. The window was level with the daybed he often played on, and I had visions of him cracking his head. I lined the edges of the windowsill. This works well. My son is a pretty good listener, and I kept telling him not to touch or pull the foam off, it was there for a reason, and it is still there two months later. It will come off very easily if pulled, just a forewarning. But I like this product and would use it again.
I bought a Safety First Foam Edge Bumper from Wal-Mart for the SAME price as this that was only about 5ft and didn't have corners, and it was already cut into strips. That was a HUGE mistake. Comparing this set to the one I bought, it wins in every category. It contains more than twice as much foam - PLUS corners, you can cut it to whatever size you need, it bends around curves, and It's MUCH softer than the Safety First bumper!I love it, and it's perfect. It STICKS! It's 3m brand double-sided tape and it didn't budge! I suspect people who said it doesn't stick did not clean/dry the surface properly, touched the tape too much, or maybe had a textured surface. I couldn't pull mine off, so I know my 9 month old can't.
Easy to put up, takes a bit of time, but overall fairly easy!  Wasn't too crazy about the type of adhesive that comes with it, but I look at it this way.... I'd rather re-finish my wood coffee tabble than deal with all the boo-boos and broken teeth it(my coffee table) has caused! (I have three kiddos and this coffee table has taken a tooth from two of them before they were 2yrs old)  I'm hoping this protector will prevent that with my third little one! Personally I hate this coffee table, but my husband will not get rid of it... I put this protector on my fire place too, and it looks and feels wonderful.  I like that it streches a bit, and I had plenty of adhesive left over! I rate this product 4 stars, definitely worth the price just know that adhesive is going to be a consern when I remove the product!
You know when you're child free and buy great furniture? You can't fathom the day when you'll have to apply foam to your beautiful wood table so your child doesn't go head first into the sharp corner?  Those days are now a distant memory and you bite the bullet and apply a foam guard.  Then you go to take it off because your child has spilled parmesan cheese and... what...the? The wood came off.  The WOOD came off.  I expected to have to use some Goo-Be-Gone to get off the adhesive but this actually destroyed the table.  Not like a dent that could be sanded.  I piece of wood literally splintered off.  So, while this product will protect your kid's noggin, don't put it on a piece of furniture you like.
These have a nice amount of cushioning to protect my 9 month old daughter as she &#34;cruises&#34; around our coffee table.  They come with a good amount of adhesive tape, which is why I purchased this brand over others.  It is difficult to get them to stay adhered without putting adhesive tape on BOTH sides.  Once I put it on both sides, it works much better.  Because this item is also a bit &#34;stretchy&#34; it was tricky to measure it exactly right.  So, we have small gaps between the pieces which aesthetically isn't great, but it still protects my daughter.  If I had the time and money, I might purchase again and install it better knowing what I know now, but it works fine.
When you first put this on the table you feel like it has made things safer for your child, however the first time they get near it they are able to pull it off because the adhesive provided with it doesn't hold well unless you have a completely flat surface to attach it to.  (I suppose if you use a stronger adhesive you would run the risk of damaging the table).Only buy if you have a large top face and edge to the table with no decorative surface changes (must be completely flat to hold at all)
This product comes with special double-sided sticky tape to attach the guards. It&#699;s easy to apply to the inside of the guards and easy to attach to the corners and surfaces that you want to use. For us we have an extremely sharp edge in our shower and baby crawls around so we didn&#699;t want him to slip and fall on the edge. We put the guard on the edge and it stays even though it gets wet every day as we shower. I used the table corners for the corners of low window sills that are in his play area and it works well to protect him from falling on them and doubles as a teether. lol He loves chewing on it! It&#699;s a very soft, spongy material. Hopefully there&#699;s no BPA in it because it&#699;s constantly in my son&#699;s mouth!
Needed this item for our brick fireplace and decided to give it a shot despite some saying that the double sided adhesive tape didn't work well.  I assumed we would try it and then rig something else up (velcro, etc) if it didn't work.  It has been one month and the included adhesive tape is working very well.  My 11 month old goes up to it and tries to chew it (for all the chew toys that child has?!) and it stays put no problem.  Time will tell how long it lasts, but I am happy with the density of the edge guard and how well it went on that even if I did have to do some reworking of the adhesive in the future I would still be happy with the quality of the edge guard as well as the safety the product provides.
I love how soft and cuddly this changing pad cover is.  I also appreciate how many colors it comes in.What I am disappointed with is the durability.  I have 3 of these and have used them for just over a year.  They are totally falling apart at the elastic. Now, keep in mind that we use disposable "chucks" (those blue hospital disposable under pads) on top of this terry cloth changing pad.  It makes it less messy (especially early on) and doesn't require washing as much.  I also washed them in cold water with Baby Dreft detergent, hung them to dry and rotated the 3 covers that we have.While it is a nice product while it lasts, I just expected them to be more durable.
I am so pleased that the Contoured Changing Table Pad has so many choices in color for its cover! I purchased the lilac, and a white cover and they both go well with my nursery decor. I only wish I got more that two!These terrycloth covers are thick, absorbant and easy on my newborn's skin. The only problem I have with them is that they shrink a little when you wash them. So, when you go to put them back on the pad the fit is a bit tight, but I find they pull out pretty quickly to thier normal size. When they do finally get to small to fit the pad I will go out and buy some more! I mean it's terrycloth, what do ya expect? Besides, the darn things get all kinds of yuck on them all day. They are going to take a beating being washed all the time as it is. They are totally worth the money to replace! I would buy them again!
Very convenient - I have a one year old and I babysit a one year old. I'm definitely not going to spend 100 bucks or more on a double stroller, but since I found two umbrella strollers on sale for 10 bucks each, my double stroller was only 30 bucks! It handles well. When you put the connectors on, make sure they're tight, and even so it will seem like there's too much slack for it to really move, but it does work. Just give it a go. :)
These are easy to put on and take off.  They work well to connect two umbrella strollers.  The rubber inserts do fall out easily, so I can tell these may not last long.  They only work with one thickness of bar so they are not compatible with all strollers.  I use a combination of these for the top connection and a different brand for the bottom that are adjustable since my stroller bars are wider at the base and I connect in 4 places instead of 3 for a sturdier connection.
I was a bit hesitant to buy this booster, although it came highly recommended.  I felt like it was overpriced and essentially offered nothing...boy, was I wrong!  I've been using this booster for 2 years now.  It has been used by my 3.5 year old and his 2 year old brother.  Both of them LOVE it.  The seat is comfortable for them to sit on, unlike the hard plastic seat we had before it.  It doesn't slide around on the chair, and it is SO easy to clean.  I also like that it is easy to take along if we're headed to grandma's house.  No extra straps, trays, or pieces to worry about! I don't have a single complaint with this seat after 2 years of use...it is well worth the money!
This is a great booster and is effective for it's job--but there are a few things that could make it an even better seat.  I can't use this booster in my home because it is made out of a rubber substance that my kids LOVE to pull apart!! My young toddler likes to bite and take chunks out of the booster seat.  If you have an aggressive chewer in the house, you may want to think about this--this material is highly attractive to chewers!  Also, the seat does not come equipped with straps.  I had to switch to another booster with straps due to some safety issues associated with this also.
This is the best booster seat. It "grips" easily to chairs and does not slide. We use it in our captains chairs and our son is great in it! It is the most durable seat too. My nephew has had one for two years or more now and it is still in EXCELLENT condition. It is soft and comfy. It may seem pricey for a booster but it is definitely worth it. It travels easy and wipes clean in a heartbeat. Grandma even bought one to keep at her house for all the kids! Definitely a must have!
For the older toddler, this booster seat is more comfortable and spacious than the hard plastic booster seats with trays.  The hard plastic seats slide around on wood chairs and never feel stable, even when strapped around the chair.  The trays don't leave enough room for a bigger child's legs.  However, this booster seats is soft and cushiony.  It feels stable on wood chairs, and it allows the child to sit at the big people's table.  Obviously, it's not as good for the young infant or younger toddler who needs a tray to contain the mess, but it's definitely better for the older toddler who knows how to eat neatly off a plate or bowl.  The older toddler hopefully is also well-trained enough to know not to jump around in the seat because it's not attached to the adult chair.
We love this booster. My 3 year is still using it and I think he started using it around 18 months or so. We have solid oak chairs and didn't have the problem of other reviewers. It sits in the same chair almost all the time and there's no residue. Maybe it has more to do with the chair finishing. Your chair does need to be made of something to "grip" this chair, such as a wooden chair. I tried to take it to my dad's house and he has cooshy leather chairs, and it didn't work. It cleans extremely easily, holds him securely, and works better than I could have expected.
These are nice jumbo corners that didn't make our table look too hideous, but at some point your baby's going to learn to pull them off!  This didn't happen for us for a while and I really think any other brands would have the same problem, so this one's the best in the market.  My daughter fell and hit her face on the corner guard and her mouth still bled, though the damage would have been much worse without the corner guard.  It's definitely better to have these than nothing at all.
This is a great product.  They do what they are supposed to do, at least on my desk.  My desktop/corners consist of a wood laminate, with a very smooth surface, so these things stick very well.  However, I have not attempted to take them off yet, and i'm sure a little 'Goo-Gone' or rubbing alcohol will do the trick when the time comes.  I will be dissapointed if they harm some of the finish, but then again you can't put a price on protecting your precious child from severe injury, which can easily occur when their head hits a table or desk corner!  For this 'peace of mind', I give this product 5 stars.  One more thing... there is NO substitute for proper and constant child supervision.
I'm not judging anyone else, but I was very surprised when I read how many people wrote about these coming off or being pulled off. I guess my daughter never tried very hard, but they are really stuck tight. I've had one set for about 14 months, and bought a 2nd set for another table about 8 months ago, and they're not going anywhere.  I can't speak to them hurting the finish of the wood, since I've never tried to take them off.  They don't look too bad either, since the dark color matches most of my furniture. I do wish they came in more colors for some of my lighter wood.
I ordered these for our coffee table corners. The are rounded corners, but not so round they can't knock a little noggin. From the information I read about this product it said to order the jumbo/wider (rather than standard size) guards. Unfortunately I guess what I really need is something not just for wide corners but rounded as well. We have a lot of items to baby-proof, these seem very soft and durable, I am sure I will find corners that can use them. But they won't work for the coffee table and that is the area I am the most concerned with at the moment.
When a baby gets to the crawling stage, your life changes. Table corners are just one of those places that must be protected and this little gadget does so very well. There are some tables that require the corner piece and the long padding all around the parameter of the table due to sharp edges, but in most cases, this is enough. I only wish they were a little less obvious. Unless you have very light wood furniture, these things stick out like a sore thumb. My only concern is that there is an adhesive (that supposedly comes right off).  Many months from now I suppose I'll find out if that is true, but in the meantime I have (relative) peace of mind when my grandson is crawling or toddling around and that is Priority 1.
I considered this when it was full price, 50 bucks.  When I saw it for 25, I just had to get it.  I took it back the next day because the latches that keep the buttons away from Baby broke and the buttons wouldn't work.This second try has been better.  I found it for 12.50 and decided that it would make a gift for someone else if it didn't work for me (man, I can be cruel :)  This time, it seems to work pretty well.  All the buttons work.I did have a little trouble with the light because when the light is on, the button is pressed in.  I have fingernails, so the button can be a bit tricky until you get the hang of it.I am glad I decided to try this product again, but I wouldn't have paid the 50 bucks for it.  If you can't find it on sale, get a regular CD player: they plug in and are cheaper.
We love this product.  Being able to change the music our son listens to every nite is such a nice option - and we don't have to listen to the same lullaby's all the time (if at all).The light is dim, but as a few others noted, who wants a bright light?  The baby is trying to sleep!It's enough light to see him if I peek in and it's still on.I feel the volume is plenty loud enough.  It is a crib cd player, not a house cd player.  It's plenty loud enough for his tiny nursery, and i've never turned it all the way up.I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 for the battery issue - it eats batteries worse than any other toy he has - including the swing which we use much more often.I thought that was strange, and if it does take that much power, it should come with rechargable batteries.Maybe the next model :)overall we're very pleased though.
This item is not top quality.  I don't have too many of this company's other products, so if this is an example of their quality than I don't think I will.  First off the cover does not open without popping off the hinge and needing to be reattached, the batteries only lasted through two cd's, the volume doesn't get very high, and it doesn't even fit on the side of our crib.  Being in the baby business they should know that not all crib's are made the same.  You are much better off just getting a simple boom box that play's cd's.
What a disappointment!  We were so grateful to receive this at a baby shower- it was something we really wanted.  However, it did not live up to expectations.  The sound quality was awful- very, very quiet even on the highest volume setting and, even worse, extreme static.  I exchanged it for another one thinking that maybe the first was defective but had the same problems.  For such an expensive item the quality is very poor.We ended up ordering the Fisher Price Tape Player online and it is really wonderful.  We love it- buy it instead, better quality and cheaper!
I thought this would be a great idea. So when we found out we were having twins i ran out and bought 2 of them. We started to put the nurserys together and when it came time to put these on they wouldnt fit. I didnt want to stratch the crib rails up so we took them back. When we did try to play a cd in them it skipped. We ended up just buying small cd/radio players for each of their room because this is something they can both use for a long time.
We have been using this seat for about 6 months with our toddler boy.  I love how it attaches to the seat easily and securely.  Once it's on, it doesn't budge, but it removes easily.  However, if our son sits down to pee, he gets pee all over the place.  Even with him holding his private part down with his finger.  The cheap "bob the builder" toilet seat does a better job of keeping the pee in the toilet while he is sitting.  I wish they would make the seat more compatible with boys.
We've tried several different potty seats and this is the best by far:1)  Fairly easy to clean, integrated design.  Love that it wipes clean if it gets messy2)  Built in pee guard for boys...  We had another seat with a snap on attachment, and of course it got lost while our daughter was using it.3)  very sturdy and stable on toilet.  This seat positively sits on the toilet, and my son is comfortable on it for even long periods of timeWe tried the soft plastic ones, and ironically he complained a lot more about those being uncomfortable than this one.  Highly recommended!
After some little potty chair fails, I decided to try out a seat that fits on the big toilet. This one came up first as it has the most reviews, and it does for a reason. This seat works, period. I do have a girl though so I cant vouch if it works for the little guys.It has a device underneath that tightens it onto the big toilet seat. My toilet seat is the flat plastic kind so it went on with little problem. I have to finagle it a little, but it fits and is very secure so thats a win in my book.SIDE NOTE: Grandma owns the Fischer Price froggy potty which works perfectly, so if you are also thinking about getting a little chair, I highly recommend it.
I definitely, wholeheartedly recommend the Baby Bjorn toilet seat reducer.This seat is contoured in a way that makes it comfortable to sit on and boy's pee goes into the toilet.There is a kind-of dial thing at the back that you turn to make the seat fit snugly and securely onto your toilet so it does not shift when your little one is on it.The handle at the back means you can hang it on a little hook if you wanted to stick one of those removable 3M hooks to your wall.I also give bonus points for the colour- white without a licensed TV character in sight :-)
We've tried a few different brands of potty seats, and this is by far our favorite. It stays in place when kids climb on and off instead of slipping or tipping like some other seats. Unfortunately we changed our toilet seat/lid combo to one of those slow close plastic ones that has the removable hinges for easy cleaning, and the Baby Bjorn training seat doesn't fit it. Also, after about three years (and a couple of kids) the black rubber handle on the back started to break, but I consider that minor wear and tear. Overall, I'd recommend this seat above others on the market. It safe and looks nice.
this fits my elongated toilet which the padded cartoon character seats will not. It's easy to clean too - there are no crevices like the padded seat. The splashguard doesn't really do much for boys and because of it, my son can't keep his legs close together like he can on the mini toilets in his daycare, so he has to be very conscious to not spray when he pees.I think it's a bit bulky for travelling. we have a folding potty seat that we bring with us for travelling.
I bought BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer to potty train my son.  He likes using it, and the splash guard in the front works.  There is an adjustment wheel located at the back of the seat by the handle to adjust the Toile Trainer to the size of the regular toilet seat.  We have elongated Kohler toilets and the BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer adjust to fit snugly.The reason I am rating it 4 stars is the adjustment wheel started slipping after a few removal and reinstallations.  Now if I have to reinstall the seat, I pre-adjust it and then position it onto the regular toilet seat.
i first sat my baby on this when she was about 9 months old, and we've reduced the number of diapers significantly, with very rare #2 diapers, woohoo!!! of course i had to hold the baby, but at 11 months, holding is discouraged. there are occasionaly wiping of the front lip, but it seems much less ickier than cleaning out a typical potty.this fits almost all toilets except some smaller-sized apartment toilets, though i was able to place it on the toilet seat without having the trainer fit properly. (but then if your kid isn't too young, you probably won't need a trainer for a small toilet.) i even take this to other people's homes and have used it successfully everywhere.i'm so relieved that my baby cooperated with early potty training, and this product enabled me to accomplish that.
I just got done potty training my boy/girl twins using the small potty chairs that sit on the floor but we are planning a vacation in a few weeks and they were terrified of using the big potty but we really had to get them using one.  I bought a cheap-o potty seat and it slid around all over the place and they were scared to use it so we went back and paid twice as much and got the Bjorn and so glad we did.  We have a TOTO brand toilet and the seat is very deep and contoured so the lock on the Bjorn didn't work at all on our toilet seat, but because it also has a grippy bottom and is quite large, it fits great anyway.  My toddlers were fine using it and began using the big potty the same day we bought it.  Definately worth the extra money, great design!
This seat has worked very well for our 25-month-old boy.  Very easy to use and clean, and also easy to remove and replace to allow adults to use the toilet.  One caution: the splash guard in front will not always catch everything, especially if our son is not sitting centered and aligned with it, or if he moves around.  You'll need to watch out for this, and you'll likely have a little spillage from time to time.  Perhaps the next version can offer an expanded splashguard.  I still think this seat is very much worth buying.
My daughter was scared of falling in the toilet when she first started potty training.  She was so scared that she would wait until the very last second to go and she would have accidents because of it.  With this training seat she fit perfectly and her fear was over.  We ended up purchasing 3 of these because they worked so well.I am only giving it four starts though because we did find that she would hurt her booty and &#34;parts&#34; some times when she would try to slide up on it.  I understand why the bump in the front is there (to stop kids from peeing out the front of it) but if it could be made with a softer material (at least on the front) it might make it easier and less painful for kids to get on and off of.
This is the first seat you used for potty training.  I LOVED it for the following reasons: 1. it adjusts to stay in place, 2. it fit all of the toilets in the house (important when you have two round and one elongated toilet), 3. it wasn't padded or cheesy (cheesy characters), and 4. I like that the shape sort of holds the child in.  I potty trained my daughter the week she turned 2 and wanted to be sure that she didn't fall off of the potty, but I also didn't want to deal with emptying a little potty into a big one.  This is a GREAT seat.  I would give it 4 1/2 starts if I could.  We ended up needing a second seat for another toilet and it had handles.  My daughter prefers to have the handles (even if the seat itself is not as secure), especially when she is pooping.
I have 3 boys and this is the solution for our needs. I like it is made of hard plastic instead of the foam type seat, easy to clean. It has a nice shape for sitting. As far as a boy doing number 1 while sitting on the potty, he has to lean forward or you will have a mess to clean up. That doesn't seem to be a big deal to the boys. It has a nice loop on the top so we can hang it on the toilet with the potty hook and it is adjustable to fit different potty hole sizes. Seems very durable. I have one in every bathroom.
Love this thing.  Relatively cheap, comes in various colors, has an adjustment knob to 'fit' various toilet sizes, the hooks allows you to hang it (added a tacky hook to bathroom wall) and best of all it doesn't have the creavises other seats have - let me explain.  Had another potty seat that was 'cushioned' -&#62;  not sure why a kid needs a cushioned seat, it is not like they will be sitting reading the newspaper for ten minutes at a time - anyway, it didn't take long for the vinyl cushion to get pee and other 'gunk' stuck between the cushion and the plastic rim - and then you have to look at it each time to put it on the toilet.  This is a better option.
Now I know why the cheap potty seats are so cheap. Wish I has been able to see this side-by-side with the cheap ones. If I had this would have been the one I would have bought. This potty seat is well designed, doesn't rock, and is one piece. It's adjustable and easily fits the toilet at my son's house and the one at my house. My granddaughter wouldn't sit one the "cheap" one bought originally but really likes this one. Dry days are coming soon, wish they had these when my kids were at this stage.
I have a very large (and very precocious) 18 month boy who is doing GREAT with this! I just came back to order another one for upstairs after carrying one back and forth for 1.5 weeks. Super portable (but easier to have one on each floor!), I've already followed another reviewer's advice to pop it in a tote bag for when we're out and about- that way, he's not afraid of using the sometimes huge potties in stores! I can't compare this to any other seats (well, we also got an actual potty chair just in case, but he's not interested), but this has worked great so far. Very comfy, and no spraying or damaged boy parts- spray guard works great.
Bought two based on a lot of the good reviews, one for our upstairs and downstairs bathrooms. The splash guard can hurt your son. Also the splash guard doesn't work to keep the pee from shooting out from under the seat. If you have a girl it might be for you, if you have a boy don't get this seat. Make sure you read the other reviews about boys and this potty seat. Also the seat is bulky and very annoying to get it to fit each time. This potty seat has discourage our son from wanting to use the potty. If anyone who has had a hard time potty training their kids this will make it so much harder!!
This seat has such great reviews, I didn't think I could go wrong with it. We've had it for over 2 years now, and I'm getting fed up with cleaning up the mess. At first the splash guard wasn't tall enough, and everything ended up on the floor and on my son's clothes. Now, that he knows to tuck it inside and keep his legs closed, the mess is on the regular toilet seat. I have to clean the toilet seat every time I lift the BabyBjorn potty seat. Also, it would have been nice not having to remove the seat every time, and just flip it instead.Anyway, an overpriced item in my opinion. And I can't believe it has such great reviews. Maybe I'll change my mind about it once my daughter is old enough to start using it. But for now, not very impressed.
When we were potty training our daughter, my friend told me that the toilet trainer that goes on toilet might be better to use over the one that sits on the ground because if they get too used to the one on the ground, they may be scared to go on the toilet since it's higher up.  So we bought this one and even if they are still too small, you don't have to worry about them falling into the toilet because of the way it's made.  My son is 11 months and he can sit on the toilet on this and we don't worry about him falling in.  He may try to get off but we just sit there too and bring toys or things for him to do while he sits there and then he doesn't try to climb off.
Great seat! This is our second one in 4 years and two kids! The first one had the handle crack.I bought a different potty seat to replace this one initially and it was sent back quickly in favor of this seat!There is a dial that turns to adjust two plastic pieces that sizes it for your toilet.My son is 3 and he knows how to use the potty all by himself. He is able to put this down on the toilet and get on and off it himself. There is no leakage between the seat and the toilet seat and the guard works well.I fully expect that my daughter will be able to use this seat when she is ready to potty train.
Here is what I like about this:- you can adjust some fitting with the turn of a dial on the inside back of the seat so that it doesn't shift when on the Toilet (this way I can use it on different toilet bowls and it sits steady)- just one piece (that way things don't get in between the pieces), less mess and easy to clean- contoured etc and all the stuff they say in their descriptionWhat I wish was different:  I wish that the seat was a little cushioned.  If he's been on the potty for a while, poor thing has red marks on his butt. (it goes away, just don't like seeing that)
Haven't had the opportunity to need this yet as we are still utilizing the baby potty seated on the floor as our guy is too little to get on the regular potty yet.  However, wanted to get everything together and ready when we will need it.  This seat is very well made and really like that it is all one piece so there is no need to worry about bacteria collecting around a "snap on" deflector (for boys).  Purchased 2 of these, one for myself at my home and one for my daughter and son-in-law at theirs, as they are in the process of potty training our grandson.  It was easy to adjust to fit our regular seats, and I now have it on a hook next to the regular potty when the time comes that we are ready to use it.  I also purchased the stool and potty book...and am ready whenever my kiddies are.  Highly recommend this seat as it very well made.
My son is 3 years old and I potty trained him in 1 day. I purchased this toilet seat along with a potty book for boys (and no potty). He learned to go on this by itself, I was amazed at how fast he learned. All I had to do was get rid of the diapers and buy him big boy underwear to start the potty journey. It took a day of "accidents", but it was well worth it. This toilet seat is versatile and you can take it along anywhere you go! I highly recommend it -- no need for a potty either :).
I read several reviews before settling on this one.  Initially, I was considering the potty with the ladder but breakage, slippage and space were an issue with that one.  This turned out to be the ideal potty seat for us.  It fits over my elongated toilet seat comfortable without slipping so I have no fear of it falling in when my little ones rush to the potty.  They even put it on the seat themselves.  It little ridge on the front are perfect for little boys and avoid any leakage or spilling!  The kids love that they have their own seat that is so comfortable.  Baby Bjorn products are always well-made and well suite for the their particular purpose and this one proves that.  It gives me peace of mind knowing that my little ones can use it easily without fear of them slipping off of it or the seat falling into the bowl.  Great potty seat!
I bought this item after reading the reviews for it here on Amazon.  I have a less exspensive cushioned princess toilet topper but this Baby Bjorn is SO MUCH better!PROS--Easily adjustable to fit most (if not all) toliet seats.-Snug fit; doesn't wiggle/wobble when climbed onto by my 28lb 2yr old & no worries of her legs/fingers being pinched between the seats.-Ergonomic design; my daughter seems very comfortable on this seat; Much more so than the "cushioned" one I mentioned prior.-Would work well for girls or boys since it has a high front side which helps to avoid accidents.-Very estically pleasing.-One fluid piece so it is easy to clean; no grooves, creases, etc. to have to worry about.-Durable; something I can definitley hold onto for our next baby.CONS-N/A ;)I would highly recommend this item.  It's worth the extra $10 you'll pay for it over the cheaper ones!
We have a standard size and shape toilet seat. Yet, this potty seat fits the seat in an awkward manner, causing pee to leak both on top and under the front of the toilet seat. Granted, I have little boys, so maybe this isn't so much of a problem with girls.We had MUCH better luck with the Mommy's Helper Cushie Tushie potty seat (the one with the ducks on it), which is, incidentally, much cheaper and easier to clean. The same unfortunate pee situation never happens with that seat.
Though this is a nice sturdy potty seat and would probably be perfect for girls or larger boys, it did not work for me.  My son has to hoist himself off and on the potty as he is not yet tall enough to rest his feet on the foot stool while using it.  The pee guard is so large that I was seriously concerned about his "equipment" being damaged in the process of trying to stand up. I recommend the Arm and Hammer potty seat over this (much cheaper too).
my son loves it!i bought 4 different brands for him to try out and this is the best one!perfect shape, perfect comfort, perfect size for a 4 yr old. (potty trained now)sometimes, he sits on this for a long time....so i know it's very comfortable....LOLthe handle helps germophobic mommies. and it easy to wash too.the pee cover should be higher though as he has to hold down his thing so as not to pee all over the toilet floor.even with that, it is still a 5 star rating!
This lid is great for my petite 3 year old to use. It adjusts to fit most toilet lids- does not fit well on grandma's already contoured seat. This is a hard, but perfectly contoured seat for a little bottom. We have the cushioned one, with little ducks which is nice, but this is really a step up. It has the nice guard in front to help minimize over shoot. I really liked this one enough to purchase a second for trips to grandma's. It is strong, sturdy, easy to clean. It comes in other colors, but I only have white. It is great how it adjusts to fit snugly with my lid underneath. Since my daughter is petite she has a hard time getting high enough to just sit- she has to "shimmy" and this snug lid is very safe for her to shimmy onto with out moving. Worth the extra money.
I've bought several potty training seats, and this is by far the very best out there as far as fit and stability.If I were going to change one thing about it, it would be to make a boy's version and a girl's; the guard in front is pretty unnecessary for our daughter, and it gets in the way of her wiping herself.With that said, I'm really happy with the way it adjusts to fit the seat and doesn't wobble or slide to one side, like other seats I've tried. It's also very easy to take on and off the toilet seat so others can use the bathroom with no trouble, thanks to the handle.Don't bother with those other seats. This is the one you need.
After 3 weeks of use maybe 1-2x/day, the rubber handle is separating from the rest of the potty.  I just began hanging it from a hook, so maybe that had something to do with it.  This isn't a problem that I read in any of the reviews I perused, and the instructions on the box say to hang it on a hook.  I am returning it and hoping for better luck with the replacement.Other than that, my daughter loves this.  She's 18 mo old, 21 lbs, and fit it quite well.  We only managed to catch her doing her business using it once though.  The product fit very well on my elongated toilet seat and was easy to adjust.
I ordered this for use while visiting my parents. It is okay for something like that, but I would not use it for much else.I have a very active 2 year old who does not always want to take time to sit on the potty. She can easily scoot accross the floor while seated on it.It might be good if you have a very early potty trainer or one on the (very) smaller side. My daughter is about 35 inches tall and her knees come to her chest while seated on this.
I bought this potty after reading the reviews and trying to decide on the little or big potty.  I didn't think the small one would be a problem, since  my 18-month old son is on the small side.  However, after receiving it, I would only recommend this potty to those who are doing EC or for travel. My son seems to like it, but he looks huge on it and it will not last for long.  It also slides all over the tile floor like someone mentioned.  I really wish I would have bought the Bjorn big potty.
This potty is great. As the previous reviewer mentioned, it's one piece so nowhere for the pee to go except inside. I think the only fault is that it's incredibly low to the ground, so although that is great for new learners, once they master the potty training and you just need an extra around the house, it doesn't encourage them to go because it's too short. If you can spend a bit more, the newer model with the inside that comes out ($24.95) is much better in my opinion. HIgher for sure, and actually easier to dump since it has an insert. Make sure never to use bleach in these, though, I ruined the bottom of one of these by letting it sit in a 50% bleach solution, it ate away the smooth bottom.
We take this little potty with us everywhere.  I actually purchased online from Amazon specifically to find the one piece BabyBjorn Little Potty (BBLP) after my friends raved about it.It now lives permanently in the back of my car, so that my toddler can have easy access to a potty when we're on the go.  I've also taken this on planes and trips in our carry-on, so that we would have access to a potty ...even if there was not a bathroom available.  With little ones it is so hard for them to wait, and this helps keep them potty-independent.Also, if you do infant pottying or elimination communication, this is one of the &#34;must-have&#34; pottys.  The seat is a little on the smaller side compared to the standard little pottys you'll find at Toys R Us or wherever ...which makes it ideal for little ones (I am talking 1 year or younger).
I've noticed that the negative reviews on this potty focus on how small it is. Yes, it IS small. It would be too small for most kids beyond the age of 3 and any bigger/tall  toddlers. If you are in that category you'd want to look at one of the larger Bjorn potties.HOWEVER, if you are ECing a baby or working on potty training with a younger/smaller toddler, this potty is great. Their feet will touch the ground and it's easy for them to sit on. For myself I love the simple, one-piece design. This makes it really easy to carry to different areas of the house, in the car, and it seems less tempting to be used as a hat. We have used 3 different potties over the years with our children and this is my favorite. The back has a knotch cut out for easy carrying. Really great little potty.
We used this chair starting when my daughter was around 8 months old and it was the perfect fit for her.  It was comfortable (or so it seemed) and easy to keep clean!She is 18 months now and we still use it often every day and we have more than gotten our money's worth - but I think she is getting a bit big for it now.  I am eyeing moving up to the regular size Bjorn potty seat, which I hope will be a little more comfortable for her height.
This is perfect for my 20 month old.  She can sit on it on her own.  It is VERY small.  Imagine a gallon of milk cut in half.  My daughter is small for her age and it fits her perfectly.  There is no problem emptying it.  We just add a small amount of water and dump it in the toilet.  Then a quick rinse and dump that in the toilet.  This is much better than seats on the real toilet that she feels uncomfortable on.  She is relaxed on this and that makes all of the difference.  It is perfect for us, but be aware it is small.
I got two of these after starting EC with my 9 month old.  The potty is a perfect size for a young child/baby who is beginning to use the potty.  My son can't get on it by himself, but can get off...his feet touch the floor when he is seated and he is low enough to reach for toys.  The one piece design is great for cleaning.  Other reviews said that they wished Bjorn would make a clear potty like this which is why I got white (next best thing for seeing when he's done).  If you are considering trying EC...don't hesitate you will be shocked how readily young children will indicate they need to potty and will use the potty consistently.  Great quality product for price!
This is a no frills, easy to clean, comfortable potty...just as a potty is supposed to be. I wanted something that would be comfortable for her little bumbum but nothing that would distract her from the job at hand. The price was definitely a plus as well. She is 2 1/2 years old, at 29 lbs and 34 inches and is on her way to becoming fully potty trained. Cleaning is pretty easy, I wipe with Clorox Disinfecting Wipes 4-Pack: 1 Fresh Scent, 2 Lemon Fresh, 1 Orange (78 Wipes Per Canister - 312 Wet Wipes Total), wash with hot water and spray withClorox Anywhere Daily Sanitizing Spray, 22-Fluid Ounce Bottles (Case of 9)and let dry or wipe dry.
I own two of these potties.  We're practicing elimination communication and these potties are the perfect size for infants!  I love that there aren't any extra bells and whistles to get in the way of easy clean up.We have one in blue and one in yellow.  My only complaint is that the yellow one came with huge black scuff marks and scratches all over it.  Even with extensive scrubbing, I can't get all the black off.  Obviously, this doesn't affect useability, but I feel robbed paying full-price for something that looks like it's been thrown under a bus.  I'm sure Amazon would have accepted it as a return, but what new parent has the time for that?  Big disappointment!  Especially since the yellow color was sooooo cute!  Way cuter than the blue - which, in comparison, seems a bit dull.
We bought this potty chair after much research and also owning another one - a Winnie the Pooh Potty chair with a removable urine shield that pops off too easily and just asks to be lost.  This chair is so much better that it doesn't even compare.  Our son has been using it to go to the bathroom (so far just pee pees :) ) for several months and loves it.  In contrast, he is lukewarm about the other chair.The best things about this chair:1)  Simple two piece design means that it is easy to clean.  The bowl lifts out and rinses easily.  Other potties seem to have 5 or more pieces, just asking for places to trap dirt.  Not a good thing with a potty2)  built in urine shield (into the bowl) works great and our son loves sitting on it.  It is a nightly ritual before his bath.3)  inexpensiveDownside?  We haven't found a downside yet.
This is my second potty purchase and I truly wished it had been my first. My first was the fisher price fun to learn potty, which costs about $5 more and is shaped like a regular toilet with the pretend flush handle. My son thought it was a toy and constantly "flushed" to hear the music instead of sitting on it. When this potty arrived and I took it out the box, he grabbed it and said "mine" and immediately sat down on it. He started using it the very next day and it's been a success so far. I don't know if it's the potty or if he's just ready to be potty trained (he just turned 3) but I do know that he loves his potty. I highly recommend getting this and forget about the bells and whistles of the fisher price model.
My daughter is on the thinner side and at 18 months struggles to get comfortable in this chair. She's not able to sit on it without falling in. There's no way that she could sit on this for any length of time because she's having to hold her weight so she doesn't fall in. In addition, the splash guard makes sitting on this super awkward. Another mother wrote about how her daughter needed stitches after cutting her genitals on the splash guard. I can totally see how this can happen. It's not safe for your child to independently seat themselves without some help.
I started using this potty with my daughter when she was just able to sit up on her own.  The high back was more helpful then, than it is now, but it's still nice to have the high back.  She likes to lean back and throw her arm over the back.  She thinks she's so cool when she sits on her big girl potty.I like the &#34;handle&#34; on the front shield because my daughter hangs onto it and leans slightly forward when using the potty for #2.I like the design of the bowl and how it fits in the potty.  No leaks.  The potty chair my mom has, if my daughter is at a certain angle somehow it leaks onto the floor.  That has never happened with this potty chair.PROS:- High back to help support baby- No-slip bottom keeps potty from sliding on tile floorCONS:- Haven't thought of any yetI bought a second one of these to leave at day care.
Since we practice elimination communication we looked for a potty that would work well for a young child who just began sitting with no (or very little) support. We started using this when our LO was 5.5months old. From the age of 6.5 months or so, our LO was really comfortable on this potty (it was OK earlier, but only for very short duration). It is very steady, and super easy to keep clean -- you just take out the inner compartment and wash it out. We are very happy with the decision to go with this model.
So we have been using this potty seat for several months now trying to get our daughter used to going on the potty.  I bought this one because it had great reviews and was simple and easy to clean.  But every time we put her on it, after only a few minutes she starts complaining that her feet hurt.  What she means is that her feet are tingling and going to sleep.  Then she doesn't want to get off because her legs are numb and she gets scared.  She is not a big girl but this seat is just too uncomfortable for her.  Also, every time she gets up the insert sticks to her behind and will dump if there is anything in it.  It also leaves her with a red ring around her butt.  I am going to look for a cushioned potty chair next and hopefully we have more success.
I understand that boys need a splash guard, but there's little chance that this bright-pink potty will be purchased for a boy.  And at least our little girl finds the splash guard uncomfortable, because she has to straddle it.  She has difficulty sitting down with her legs apart and often pulls the bucket out and turns it around to sit more comfortably.  I wish that baby bjorn made an insert for girls, but they don't.  Other than that (or if your girl doesn't mind this issue), it's a great potty.  It's the right size, the right distance off the ground for a two-year-old, and the back is high enough to be supportive.
This is a great potty.  The biggest issue to me was cleaning.  This chair has no seems or corners to trap things.  The inner liner lifts off and is easy to wipe clean with a disinfectant cloth.  The boy shield is not too high and is rounded nicely so they won't hurt themselves while getting on.  The base is very solid and sturdy and doesn't move at all.  It also looks comfortable with the arm rests.  My son isn't potty trained yet but we purchased it so he could get used to sitting in it.  He seems very happy and will even sit in it to read a book.  Does what it should and doesn't distract from what they are supposed to be doing with alot of toys and noise.
This potty is just great.  My baby has been using this since she was 9.5 months old.  I love the fact that it has a chair-back so she doesn't need me to physically support her when she's on it.  All I have to do is watch her nearby.  It's really well made and very sturdy.  Also, the basin is big enough that it holds everything without spills and mess.  She doesn't mind sitting on it for 10 monutes in the mornings to do her thing...and she does pretty much without fail.  We haven't had to change a poop diaper for weeks now.  One of the most useful items I bought for the baby!
we got this chair for our son to learn to use the potty. its sturdy and comfortable for him which is great. i like that the bowl is big enough that there is no spraying on the floor and i can actually see when he goes as opposed to him standing up for me to look. its easy for him to get on and off of by himself which is another big plus. i LOVE how easy it is to clean, much easier than the other potty chair we have which is 3 separate pieces.it may not have any fancy extras but it gets the job done!
I think what makes this potty work well for my twins is the high arms.  They like to sit on it and started the day it arrived.  Also, it arrived in one day.  But they fought over the right to sit on it and I was made to buy a second one.  I have them in white and blue.There is something about this potty that makes a little one understand its purpose.  I couldn't believe how comfortable they are for them sitting on it, due to the arms and back and overall design.  I think the price was favorable and feel great about the purchase of these two potty chairs.They're right now in the early stages of learning.  We'll be using these for awhile I expect.
I have 2 of these for my twins. Having gone through the search of a good one with my first child, I found this and bought 2. It's simple to clean, you take out the wipe potty part by hooking some fingers to the front and dump the contents into the toilet. Rinse it and you're ready to go. You can sanitize it with some clorox spray and just put it back down until the next time.  It's portable so you can have it anywhere. There is an anti slip rubber on the bottom so no worries about pottying children ending up somewhere else than where you left them.My twins are now potty trained, but I still keep one in the back of the van for emergencies. You never know if you'll make it to the next toilet, you know?
We owned our last blue babybjorn potty for over 10 years. It survived 4 children.  Unfortunately, it was accidentally cleaned with a substance that ruined the coating.We decided to go with a bjorn again and we are please with this one.  It is a large potty seat so this will fit a large child.  The white part removes easily so that it can be given a quick rinse.A child can lean back and not fall off the potty. The seat is big enough so a child can sit easily without hurting themselves.Overall, I am please with the purchase.
We were using a Bjorn Little Potty (which they don't make anymore) for a long time. But as my son grew, he kept overshooting and it was becoming a problem. At Grandma and Grandpa's house they had the Bjorn Smart Potty, which seemed to work better for him. I figured the Bjorn potties have been working well for us, lets try the top of the line Potty Chair!And its working great, the bowl rinses easily. Sometimes a little pee dribbles over the side, but its easy to rinse the whole chair in the tub. I keep it on a little rug to catch the dribbles and just throw that in the wash as needed. Any potty (with boys using it) is going to have occasional dribbles.And my son was pretty excited when it arrived!
I love this potty chair!My son barely used it, just for the beginning month of his potty training but it had many very nice qualities and I would recommend it highly.The color is pretty and the chair is cute. I like my bathroom to look nice and it didnt bother me to see this in there every day.The skid rubber on the bottom really hung on to the ground well, even in those times when some bath water had gotten on the floor. It is very stable and wont move around on you or your toddler.the design is simple, which means that clean up is simple as well. the removable piece just comes out and is a breeze to clean.The high back and sides make it safer for wiggly toddlersI loved everything about this and am glad I shelled out the extra money... not only that but when it was time to sell it I got a decent amount of money for it because its a name brand and they are so expensive
Our three year old son immediately loved this chair (we ordered it in his "favowit" color green).  He is fairly tall for his age but can still sit in it comfortably and it looks like shorter children could as well.  My only complaint is that when he stands to tinkle, the urine inevitably hits the back of the seat and the design is such that it leaks underneath.  It's easy for us to clean because we have mostly hardwood or tile floors but I can wouldn't recommend this for homes with mostly carpeting.  I know our son likes to have his potty chair in various rooms in the house so it could make quite a mess.  Other than that, though, it's lightweight, easy to transport if needed, easy to clean/dump in the toilet and my son loves it.
First time potty training for our 14 months daughter.  Too many choices available on the market, but trusted all the other reviews on Amazon. This no frills potty chair doesnt look like much, but I really think they did a wonderful job designing it.  Easy to clean, and my toddler isnt uncomfortable sitting on it to go potty.  The high back rest helps alot, because she tends to sit far back to get comfortable.  Its very stable and we dont worry about it tipping over.Good value, nice design, and definitely easy to clean.  Highly recommended.
My 2.5 year old just wants to play with this and not use it as a potty. She discovered that the seat insert makes a great cowboy hat and is also fun to stand in and push around the house and put her toys inside and underneath it. I tried every rookie mom mistake to get her to take it seriously and nothing seems to be working. She only wants to potty train on the real toilet and, hey, that's not a bad thing. Just wish I knew before I bought it! I'd suggest starting with the real toilet and a seat to fit on top before buying this. Otherwise, it's a great potty chair! I think it's well made, a good size and has a nice simple design. That's why I gave it 4 stars.
My little two year old daughter is...well...LITTLE.  I bought this potty based on the excellent reviews here and for the most part, it delivered.1. It was relatively inexpensive.2. No bells and whistles to distract.3. Easy to clean.But, being that my kiddo is a shrimp AND a girl, the molded splash guard thing kept poking her in a highly uncomfortable way when she'd try to sit on this thing and it got to the point where when she'd see this potty she'd scream.  As a test, we got the pink girly version of the Summer 3 stage potty trainer and the screaming stopped.I'd recommend taking a look at this thing at a local store before buying.  It's a pretty good product, it just didn't work for us.
I can't say enough good about this potty chair.  It's inexpensive (but very well made), SUPER easy to clean, has a very comfortable splash guard for boys and is comfortable (I'm assuming).  I originally bought the Safety 1st Potty Chair/stool.  Don't like it at all.  Tough to clean (lots of spaces for urine to get) and I don't think it's very comfortable as my son refused to sit on it.  Within 20 seconds of sitting on the Baby Bjorn he peed.  Refused for weeks to do that with the Safety 1st.  Great product.  Can't say enough good about it.From a parent's stand point, it's the best b/c it's soooo easy to clean.  I'm not clean freak, but this is a huge benefit with anything in the bathroom.Kudos to Baby Bjorn for a simple product.
I almost passed over this potty for something with more bells and whistles.  There were potties that converted into stepping stools and one that had a handle that played flushing sounds when depressed.  $27 seemed a little expensive for two pieces of molded plastic (bowl and base) that made up the entire Bjorn potty get up.  In the end, I'm happy with my Bjorn purchase.  The simple design is easy to clean.  My son is well supported in the ergonomic seat that has a wide base and rubber footings so I don't have to worry about him squirming and tipping over.  The bowl is big enough to catch all of his deposits.  Some of the potties I've seen have very small bowls which I'd imagine to be difficult targets for little behinds.  My only gripe is that my little boy sometimes sprays over the splash guard and wets his clothes.  So perhaps Bojorn should look into tweeking that part of their design.
I bought this potty chair after looking at several other brands/styles because of the high back and arm support. It has a great "wrap-around" design that is perfect for my 4-month-old who is just getting familiar with the potty. For those working on infant potty training, I highly recommend this chair. My little one has no problem sitting up in this chair by herself (of course I'm holding onto her for security). She has already made many, many poops and pees in the Baby Bjorn Potty Chair! It's also very easy to clean. Just dump out contents, rinse, and wipe with a disposable disinfecting wipe. Definitely easier than changing a diaper!
We love this potty chair (bought one for each bathroom).  The design is simple.  It is comfortable and easy to use.  My 2 year old son has had no problems with it.  Very portable (we keep it in the back of our vehicle for longer trips).  We also have the BabyBjorn potty seat which is great as well.  I like having both so my son can choose whichever he wants (he likes both equally).  Made in the USA too!!
We bought this because my youngest daughter won't train on a potty seat on the toilet, so we thought this might help her transition from diapers.  It's just plastic.  I had hoped there'd be a way to put a plastic liner in the hole part so we could just take the liner off instead of having to clean the plastic bowl, but unless we want her to sit on the liner, that's not an option.  Oh well, it's a big overpriced piece of plastic.
I picked this potty up 2 days ago and I really can't complain.  My daughter is 9 months old and seems to have no problem with it.  I do understand some of the concerns with pee coming out because it happened to us yesterday.  I didn't make a big deal about it and it didn't seem to bother her.  I happened to have it sitting on a waterproof pad, just incase, so nothing got on my carpet.  But she seems very comfortable on it.
This is the ONLY potty I've found that's perfect for boys! The pee-pee guard is integrated to the seat, so it won't fall off, and is high enough to "keep it all in" if you know what I mean! =) I had to order 3 since it's seriously the only one he'll even sit on anymore! We have 4 different types/brands, but he (and I) hates them all. This one is truly THE BEST. Super-easy to dump and clean, he likes to do it himself, and the bottom of the potty is rubber-lined so it doesn't slide around when he sits down/gets up. It's also a really good size "bowl", some are waaay too small to neatly go potty in. AWESOME potty and the only one I would ever reccomend!
LOVE this potty - it's so easy and comfortable for our son to sit on. Picked this one up after starting out with a Fisher Price potty that didn't have a splash guard (stupid me!), which was frustrating for everyone involved (trying to tell/help a 2-year old to "point it down"... yeah, right) - as soon as our son tried this one out for the first time, his motivation level skyrocketed and he quickly became excited about peeing in the potty, instead of dreading it. The design and height are perfect, and the seat is easy to remove and empty (so much better than the ones where you have to slide the potty part out to empty it). Best potty ever!
I was originally looking at buying a potty chair that had all the bells and whistles, flush noises, music, lights, the works.  Then I thought, wait a minute, the regular potty doesn't have those things.  She wants one like mommies! I got this for her after being asked repeatedly to read "the potty book for girls" She was immediately  sitting on it without any prompting. Once I finally took her pants off she went right away.  We are still working on going always on the potty, but she loves the potty itself.  It is very basic and sturdy.  My daughter had no problem sitting with the little guard on the front.  I like that it has a separate bowl and my daughter is so proud when she can take it out and flush it down the "big" potty.
We have two of these - one for upstairs, and one for downstairs. It's great for our 2.5 year old boy who is learning to use the potty, and easy for us as parents to try to get him to use it.Pros:- There's a barrier/guard in the front so he doesn't pee everywhere. It's a huge improvement over other potties - sometimes boys just don't get that they need to hold it down.- The potty part removes easily for cleanup and pouring out.- It has a back so he doesn't fall off of it when trying to sit down. Sometimes sitting is a bit iffy at his age.- It's nonslip on the bottom, so it doesn't push around when he goes to sit.Cons:- A &#34;pour spout&#34; or something would be great along the back side.
When I began my research for a potty chair for my son, I had no idea how many things there were to consider! I really didn't want anything that made noise or had lights but we ultimately decided on this chair because of the one-piece splash guard since I learned that it wasn't uncommon for little boys to hurt their tender bits on other chairs. It is well-made and sturdy; it didn't tip when my son got on or off. I think the main thing it did was to give my son the confidence to use a potty - his feet stayed securely on the ground and it was stable and didn't slip around. He had no problem getting himself on and off of it and he liked the 'responsibility' of dumping the contents into the big potty (I liked that it was easy for him to do that, and easy for me to clean the  bowl afterward).
We just got this potty after trying the Safety 1st potty for a couple of months. As soon as my son saw it he knew just what it was. We watch the "Once Upon a Potty" video and the old bowl style potty in it was throwing him off I think. THis is close enough to that style that he started quoting part of the video upon first site. He then stood up backed up to it and sat down without any assistance, a great improvement from the other potty. He can get up and down from it without maiming his privates. His only problem with it so far is that he's apparently gotten use to having the back pressed against his rear so he pushes all the way back on this potty too. This is a little odd given its oval shaped bowl. Hopefully our stalled potty training will get a jump start down. Just in one day he is much more eager and willing to sit on it and he giggles over quoting the video while he sits there.
We used this potty chair for both of our daughters, who potty trained at about 2.5 years old.  Its simple design is absolutely ideal for use and cleaning.  It's comfortable for toddlers to sit in, as well as easy for them to lift out the bowl and empty into the toilet themselves.  The splash guard molded as part of the bowl is excellent, providing protection as well as not being an impediment to the child sitting down.  (I can't speak for how much protection it offers for little boys, however.)  The smooth plastic without any real corners or edges makes cleaning effortless.  Plus, the rubber bottom really does keep the seat from slipping across the floor.  Plus, as an added bonus, it resembles the potty seat depicted in the "Once Upon A Potty" video, so the kids can easily connect the concept to real life.  I highly recommend it, and can't imagine using any other seat!
My 2.5 year old is a big kid, 40 lbs, 38" tall. He needs a bigger potty chair, which this is. We have the smaller baby bjorn potty we were using but he can't keep his pee in it, he's just too big. I like that the potty cup comes out to wash, but it often sticks to his bottom as he stands up from it. We've had urine on the floor several times just because of this. I ask him to hold the white cup down when he stands up, he just gets over excited when he goes and stands up right away to look inside. He sat on one at a friends house that had a cover over the removable cup, which is by far a better design, but the high back on this one makes a nice spot for spending extended amounts of time on it as he reads and tries to go. All in all, I like it and would recommend it with reservations.
I have found that Baby Bjorn potty products are the best on the market and doesn't break the pocket book! It's oblong vs round so urine and poop stays in the pot. The built in splash guard is great! It's easy to clean and light weight, but built tough. Variety of colors. My triplets are all different shapes and sizes. We have a very large boy and has plenty of room for him. Our other son is a bit small for his age and because the pot is oval there is no leg stretching and no "falling in". Our daughter is long and very thin. She has no problems what so ever on this! Her tiny behind doesn't fall in or slip or anything. The splash guard never gets in her way! It's just the best! Other moms who see this ask where they can get one! Highly recommended!
This is a very nice potty seat. We've had it since my son was 6 months old, and he's been sitting on it on and off since then. It's a good size, seems comfortable enough for him, is simple, and is easy to dump out and clean. He's now 21 months and potty training, and the seat is great for him when he comes running over saying "go potty, go potty" and can easily sit and pee.Why only 3 stars? Because theSummer Infant Lil' Loo Potty, Whiteis essentially the same potty but MUCH cheaper. We have one BabyBjorn and 2 Summer Infants, and they're all great. I actually slightly prefer the cheaper Summer Infant.
Got this for my daughter (shes 2).  I like it real well.  She is a smaller child and it fits pretty good.  She can sit on it and on feel like she's going to fall in.  I would recommend this to others.  I also got the step stool. She likes to run over to the sink and wash her hands when she's done....The step is nice too.BabyBjorn Safe Step - White(I got the pink one to match her seat)It stays put and is sturdy.
I'm really surprised at the 5 star reviews for this potty chair. If I had back all the time I have spent cleaning pee up off the floor I would be so happy. The splash guard is way too short, my son just pees right over the top of it. I do like the separate potty and it's easy to clean but I still have to clean the whole chair because it simply doesn't hold in the pee stream. Ugh. I'm retiring it as soon as I get a different potty chair. MESSY.
This potty works very well for us.  My son likes that it is his size (we also have a potty seat for the toilet which he isn't so into).  It is light enough that he can move it himself, but the rubber grip on the bottom keeps it from slipping when he sits.  I can see how other children may have problems bumping themselves on the splash guard, which you can't remove, but this hasn't been a problem for him.  Also, we have had no problems whatsoever with pee going everywhere as other reviewers have.Pros:Easy to cleanGrips to the floorSturdyGood colorsRounded edgesCons:Can't remove the splash guardInside bowl can be removed easily by the child
We are taking a soft approach with potty training our 21 month old. He likes his potty chair and can sit on it comfortably, though isn't really using it much yet. Like the chair, purchased 2 of them in different colors, good size for tall 21 month old and easy to clean. I knock off one star only because I can tell the "splash control" on front for a boy isn't going to be perfect, but I think that is likely to be a problem with every potty chair out there...and no big deal since I plan to keep the potty in the bathroom only. If we do decide to take it to another room I will absolutely put something under it to protect the floors.
We have this potty in green.  I was lucky enough to find it on clearance at a local store by me for $12!!  If I would have known how much I would love this potty, I would have spent the money on it two years prior when we were potty training our first child.  I love the simple design of this potty and that it only has two parts.  It makes cleaning much easier.  No one enjoys cleaning out a potty, but it's so much easier when you only have two pieces to clean.  Our other potty had several pieces with it and a lot of cracks and crevices.  I just wipe this potty up with a lysol or clorax wipe and I'm done!
This thing is the perfect height for the boys (youngest has been sitting on it since he was 18 months, and the oldest is 4.5) to sit comfortably.  It is really easy to clean and there are no crannies for icky bits to get into.  It's pretty unobtrusive color wise, but it is kind of large. There was one incident where my older son pinched his fingers between the &#34;cup&#34; and the base, but he has since learned and we haven't had any more issues.  There is a band of rubber on the base to keep it from sliding around and it does a good job, but it seems to attract all the dust and hair in the bathroom and they stick to it pretty well, so I have to use a wet rag to rub the stuff off it every couple weeks.  Overall, great product and not too pricey.
fit as expected,,my baby love it .This potty chair doesn't come with all the whistles and bells like other potties. But is the best. When i was shopping for a potty, i read the reviews and then went to the store to &#34;explore&#34; for myself. i wasn't convinced of any other potty. why? 'cause all the others either didn't sit sturdily on the floor (and this is w/o a child sitting on it)or were difficult to clean. This potty is simple and sturdy, gets the job done, comfy (my picky daughter never complained, she likes the teddy bear logo on it), and so easy to clean. Never had a spill too. Besides, potty training should be as simple and natural as possible, so choose a simple potty. i have 2 of this item (1 downstairs and 1 upstairs, now thinking of using 1 at home and 1 for the car).there's plenty of space to stick stickers as a reward everytime she goes potty too
This is my 5th potty chair and so far the best for a boy that I have found.  The pee still splashes out occasionally, but far less than all the other brands.  It makes me so mad that they don't have boy-specific potty's.  The splash guards are always too small and they leak ( like our defective Thomas potty seat)  So I am happy to have this one as a big improvement.  My son is on the large side he is 34 pounds and 36 inches tall and just turned 2 last month. He fits on it just fine and likes that he can lean back.
Everything I read said to keep the potty as basic as possible.You can't get more basic than this potty and the winning factor for me is that it is so easy to clean.There aren't any cracks or crevices you need to worry about.I bought it long before I knew my child was ready to use it and placed it in the bathroom as someplace she can hang out while Mommy was in the potty.  If your child was like mine, she wanted to follow you everywhere, even the bathroom.She started sitting on her potty to emulate me.After a bit, she asked to take her pants off and that's how we started potty learning.Since the basin is one wrap around tub, I just life it off to clean and put it back.  No need to snap things or worry about cleaning crevices.I also like that it is the right size.  The back helped stabilize her when she was really small and now as an older toddler, it still fits her just fine.
Easy to clean.The &#34;lip&#34; at the front pretty much prevents boys from making a huge mess while on the potty, but there are not any rough edges to catch skin.Easy to take the &#34;bowl&#34; off to pour the contents in the toilet.  Even my 2 (almost 3) year old can easily pour in toilet without too many spills.I like the back and the arm rests on the sides. Makes it comfortable for the child, especially when we initially began using the potty.
This is a great little potty chair.  I like its two piece design, and how easy it is to empty.  I like the high back, and so does my son as he likes to "lounge" as he uses it.  The only downside is that the piece the comes out does sometimes stick to his behind so when he stands up there is potential for a mess, but this will be true with any two piece plastic chairs.  I really like the no slip grips on the bottom of the chair so my son can't scoot it across the floor.  All in all,  I would probably buy this chair again.
Overall this is a nice little training potty.  Simple design, high back for comfort and easy to clean.  My son seems to like it just fine but I wish it had a taller splash guard.  My son is 20months old, 3+ ft tall and weighs a little over 30lbs.  He fits on this potty just fine but he ALWAYS tinkles over the splash guard so I have to aim his weewee down for him.  I would not let my son use this by himself at this point (we've only just started potty training) because odds are I will end up with tinkle all over the floor.
We have just started potty training my 22-month old, and haven't used this chair very much.  It is sturdy and doesn't look like it will slide on the floor or accidentally tip over.  It is a good size for a toddler and comes in lots of great colors. I bought this because I read many lukewarm reviews on the potty chairs that sing and light up and do fancy things like dispense stickers...we wanted something simple and basic, and this fits the bill. My only complaint is that the inner bowl, while very easy and quick to remove and clean, can be a blessing and a curse: when my daughter sits on it for any length of time, it sticks to her skin, and has almost spilled when she stands up too fast.  That is the only thing to watch out for.  Other than that, it is great!
I bought this because of the excellent reviews, so I felt it necessary to add my review that is not as positive.My son is 3'3" & 30 pounds. (he is almost 3 yr old) He does fit on this potty, but it leaves horrible red marks in his inner thighs after only sitting on it a few minutes. It hurt his bottom so badly that he cried & said "oh mommy my legs!" It's not great to start potty training with a painful experience. He is now afraid of it.I don't know if my son just has very sensitive skin or if it's because he is too big for the chair, but I switched to a soft seat that goes on the big toilet & we are trying that now. I wouldn't recommend this potty for larger children.
I wanted a chair with a removable bowl, but now that I've seen my son grab it and attempt to dump it out, part of me wishes I'd have gone for a toilet adapter style.If this is the style you want though, it's durable and sleek in appearance (for a potty chair, anyway).ETA: OK, now I'm glad that the bowl is removable as we're using it more, but you do have to watch for spills. It cleans easily and my son finds it comfortable.
We've had several potty chairs and I'd say I like this one best. It has a high back and armrests, making it comfortable for my daughter to sit. There aren't a whole lot of cracks and crevices, which makes it easy to clean. The chair is sturdy and doesn't tip over. It is larger than some of the other chairs, which were a little too small as my daughter grew. If I had to do it over again, I'd buy this chair first._________________UPDATE:  This chair eventually went to my niece and nephew.  It had been a good potty chair and I was happy to share my good find with my sister-in-law.  She agreed it is a good chair.
This was the second potty we bought for our son, who is almost 3.  In one word - horrible.  I had a lot of hope that, with all the excellent reviews, we'd find success with this one.  The basic issue is the splash guard, which really doesn't work at all.  Pee still goes everywhere.  I'd love to find one of the old-fashioned potties with the high cupped splash guard - but that's nearly impossible.  If I had known that this potty would be no better than others I've tried, I would have saved my money.
My son and I love this potty. I never had a hard time training him to use it. In fact, I only told him once what to do, and he was using it since then. He seems to be very comfortable with it that he seems to actually enjoy sitting on it while making poo and playing his toy ramp & cars at the same time. He also likes using it without doing something else so I know its not about the toy. He loves that he can be independent & his potty makes him feel that. My son is 2 years old and weighs 32 lbs. Cleaning is also very easy, even without a liner. This happens when my son would use the potty on his own without a liner. I only have good words to say about this potty. I have no complaints at all.
I just finished potty training my oldest child and really loved this potty chair.  When we first started potty training, it was a little too big for her- so if you have a small child, it might be hard for him/her to easily get on and off of it alone.  By the time she was 2.5, she had no issues getting on and off.  The splash guard is great and makes it easy to lift out while still keeping your hands clean.  The potty part is also deep enough to hold anything in it if your child decides to bring you the potty to show you their work :)Great little potty!
I love this potty seat. There is no foam seat for the pee to seep into. Just two simple pieces that are so easy to clean. This was the best thing I could have bought for all of our potty training kids. The lip in front looked too high at first. But actually it is perfect. Perfect for girls potty training and for little boys. I would recommend this seat to anyone who has a little one potty training. I just might keep this seat forever....I will have visiting grandchildren someday. :)
My husband insisted that our son would potty train with those on the adult toilet seat inserts.  We bought all different types.  Potty training just wasn't working.  I actually researched many of these potty chairs right here on amazon and the Babybjorn had the best reviews and comments, so I managed to convince my husband that we should at least try it.  Best decision ever.  My son's potty training excellerated.  Now he enjoys sitting on this potty.  It's the best height for him and he even likes emptying the receptical into the big toilet.  Easy to clean. Now my youngest likes to just sit on this potty, even fully clothed.  He feels like a big boy copying what his brother does.  Very glad we made the decision to go with this basic floor potty.
This IS a great potty. Easy to clean and simple in design, HOWEVER, if your son has learned to stand up to pee, then be prepared for messes and spills over the bowl and under the bowl to clean up.  Of course, we are teaching him to aim in the bottom of the bowl, but in the meantime, we continue to clean up under the bowl because he aims toward the backside of the potty, which then leaks underneath the top piece and onto the floor.I still give it 4 stars because of the simple design, and I love that you just lift the top part and clean/empty it.  I would've gotten their one piece smaller potty, however, my son is 2 1/2 and a big boy, so I wasn't sure if he would fit on the seat.
Our daughter uses this every morning as part of early potty training. She has low muscle tone, so we needed a potty chair that would be supportive and comfortable enough for her, and this one does the trick. She seems very comfortable sitting on it, I think because of its high back and the little bump in front that kind of keeps her in the right position. I also like this chair because the little potty bucket is smooth, without many little creases, nooks or crannies where, um, germs might get stuck -- so it's very easy to clean. That's a relief for me!
We actually started with the potty inserts that go right on top of the regular toilet (built in type, portable type, and a cushioned type).  My son was refusing to use that to potty train, and we decided to try this one instead.  It took awhile, but now he's using this exclusively.He likes it because it is just his size, doesn't require help from us, and can be put right in front of the tv (we'll have to change this last one soon!).  He will even wait to pee when we are out so he can use his &#34;small potty&#34; at home instead of public toilets.We like it because he uses it, it is easy to clean with the white part coming right out of the chair, and the splash guard is great for the boys.  There's a smaller version of this chair without the back that we take with us when we are out or on vacation too.
This is a very nice potty chair.  It is a sleek, simple design, easy to clean, no annoying sounds or other bells/whistles.  I ordered it to get my child used to sitting on the potty (not starting training yet).  I have a small (18 pound) 1 year old and this seat was just a little bit too tall.  I ended up ordering the Baby Bjorn Smart Potty, which is a very similar design without the high back/sides, and it seems to be a much better size for my needs.  It appears that the bowls are interchangeable. I posted side-by-side photo of both of the potties for comparison purposes.
I just received my son's potty chair two days ago and he absolutely loves it.  He sat it in it like a chair for an entire day the first day but when he took a pee in the potty chair, it went all over the floor instead of into the bowl.  The downfall of this chair is that, the front piece that's suppose to block the pee from spilling out, is not high enough.  My son is a 2 year old and he's rather tall for his age but height has nothing to do with the front piece.  It's just not made high enough to block the pee from spilling out.  However, it is easy to clean because the bowl just pulls out easily.
I wanted a small potty chair that would be easy for our 18 month old to sit on. We didn't pressure her to use it, but would casually ask. She would run in and sit on it, read on it, and sing songs. Fast forward to when she is 22 months and she now asks to go potty and will actually use it for that purpose!  Still in the potty training process, but this is a great starter tool.  I specifically got the white with splash guard so that it was the same color as the adult toilet in all the bathrooms and also so we could see if she went.
I bought two potties before I realized that my boy had a big bottom and most other potties have really small opening and no pee guard in the front.  I broke down and bought this.  This doesn't have the bells and whistles like some other potty.  But it's beauty is its simplicity.  he is able to sit and do his business, carry the urine/poop container to the toilet and rinse it all by himself (he was not even 2 yet!).  I would highly recommed the potty training book "Potty training in less than a day".  it's out of print but you might find an used copy on [...].
This is great, partly because it's low-profile and doesn't take up much space, and also (best of all) because it's SO easy to clean!  The plastic seems super-slippery so all potty messes slide off OR are easily wiped away with cleaning solution.  Even the white doesn't discolor over time.  The slight rubber bottom keeps it sticking to tile, so that's convenient.  I would definitely recommend this to any and all looking for a small, simple quality training toilet.  For boys, the pee guard lip works pretty well.
This is a child sized toilet.  It is attractive looking.  We have one for our downstairs bathroom and the kids bathroom as well as at the grandparent's house.  Our 2 year old was easily toilet trained on this and love it.  I think it is easy to clean, just remove the inner seat, empty, and rinse.  My son is approaching 3 and can now help with that.  I also like that we can leave it in our half bath and not have to move it when guests come over or when an adult wants to use the toilet.  We are big fans of this.
We love that this seat makes it comfortable for our little boy compared with the wider conversion style potty chairs (the ones that turn into step stools) because the back is higher and it has arm rests.  Another great perk is that it takes up significantly less space.  Makes it easier to keep it conveniently located for your toddler.  Also, despite its 'lack' of bell and whistles it is easy to clean and safe.  The no skid rubber bottom is an excellent feature!  Highly recommend this potty chair!
Having selected this chair based on the reviews here I felt I should give my own. This was for my first child, now 3 and we bought this over a year ago. He is fully potty trained now and still uses this seat and I think he'll be using it for a while to come. It cleans and disinfects very easily and still looks brand new. He's very comfortable in it and its a very very good fit. It was a year ago, and it still is. For the novice parent of boys, it doesn't matter how high they make the splash guard, boys need to point it down. That took some learning on my part. We have the Bjorn that fits over the potty too, but we've hardly used it. He and we love this one way too much and its so much easier for him to use the potty on his own.
Our son just turned two and we have begun introducing him to his own potty.  This chair is great.Pros:1- Sturdy.  He leans forward to get a wayward car or his stuffed teddy and it does not tip forward with him2- Catches all of the day's product, nothing has escaped yet- the guard is tall enough.3- Easy to take the pot out and dump into the toilet but because he is sitting on it, no chance for him to pull it out and dump while he is sitting.4- Easy to clean (the most important?)Con:1- Once he has stuck to the pot and when he stood up quickly, it stuck to him and dumped.  A minor problem in the grand scheme of things and it has not happened since.We bought one for grandma's house and would recommend highly
This was our second potty for my daughter as the first one was too difficult for her to sit on. We got it before 18 months and she is very small for her age, the other potty we had was &#34;the shortest on the market&#34; but bc of the design she had trouble. She had loved this potty since day 1 and she likes the little bear logo on the front. The only downfall ivories would be she can grab the basin and easily pull it out but she is pretty good about letting me do it. Like the gray color too.
The seat is the perfect size for toddlers, contoured to be comfortable, and designed to be easy to clean.  Your little one will sit and be situated as i the same body position as an adult on a real toilet.  The raised front of the white part serves as both a pommel/hand rest and a splash guard.  The white bowl is deep enough to prevent most splashes.  The back and arms are high enough to make your little one feel secure and allow him/her to rest against them.  The seat does not slide on tile flooring.  When your baby is done, just lift the white bowl and clean.  Perfect potty training chair.  Fits almost anywhere and is very light.
I was looking for a potty to use for baby potty training, he's 6 months old and in the 25th precentile. I saw that some people commented that it was small, which is what i was actually looking for, and it works great for us. The back is great, he can sit on quite comfortably, so long as I entertain him!He has used successfully, and it's really easy to empty. I just add some water if needed and flush it, the seat just lifts out.There is an imprint on his bum after he gets up, but he doesn't seem to mind.Here's a tip: since he still pretty short and his feel don't reach the floor, I use something to put his feet on for leverage, and it really helps. The baby wipes container is perfect.
I purchased these in the hopes they would work for our newborn.  Unfortunately, I haven't even given birth yet and I already know they're not going to hold up to the demands of a newborn wetting even once in them.The pros: inexpensive.The cons: These diapers are horribly rough, even after a washing.  The fabric is fraying and even triple folded, these things do not hold liquid.  Since I'd already washed them I figured I could at least use them for dish towels, but they merely move the water around on whatever surface you're trying to dry, they don't absorb.Save your money and skip these...and buy a higher quality cloth diaper.
These for cloth diapering?  Um, no way.  Way too thin for that.  These for burp cloths?  Absolutely!  While I still periodically reach for the pretty and colorful burp cloths that are specifically made for that use, they are not nearly as absorbent as these Gerber cloth diapers.  My child is not even all that prone to throwing up and the other burp cloths are still not enough... I cannot imagine how often you would have to reach for a 2nd, 3rd and 4th burp cloth if you had a baby who spit up all the time.  These are easily washed and inexpensive... admittedly not as pretty, but most mothers get over "pretty" real quick when real life sets in and baby becomes messy all of the time! lol
A friend recommended I register for these although she knew I was planning to use disposable diapers.  I accidentally registered for the diapers with the absorbent centerfold, and fortunately,  received these.  They are large -  27"x 27" square and are essential for baby care.  I still use them every day and my son is almost a year old.  I used them to line his cradle and changing-table when he was first born and going through many diapers a day.  They work great as burp cloths, and are superb for wiping up other food messes.  Additionally, I found they work as a light blanket during the summer months.  Extremely durable, fold-up rather small for travel, and launder well.  101 uses, I love them!
Love these! Absorbent, soft, inexpensive, held up well after many MANY washes, no stains, ect.  My only complaint is that they shrink quite a bit.My daughter has always hated wearing disposable diapers.  When she was a newborn, she'd holler whenever we tried to put one on her.  As she got older, she'd arch her back, scream, and try to get away as we were putting the diaper on her.  So when she was a newborn, I used these flat folds wrapped oragami style (no plastic cover, although you could use one) to give her a break from her disposable diaper.  We've actually made the switch to cloth diapering full time.  Now I use these as a cloth insert for the gdiaper (fold in fourths, then half) and Thirsties (fold in thirds, then half).  You could also easily use these to stuff pocket diapers.
Love that these are cotton - texture is great and they are actually much softer than they look. We don't actually use these for diapers.  I bought them as "temporary burp cloths" while deciding on some others.  I now use these exclusively.  One thing I love about them is that they wash very well - I don't spray them with any stain remover and they come out clean every time simply using Dreft detergent.We also use them to "catch" my little boys' geyser, as my husband refers to it, during diaper changes.  I think these would also be great for household cleaning as well (I'd use separate ones for those).  These also make a great light-weight, breathable blanket for blocking the sun - we live in Texas, so this is a huge plus!
I just want to start of saying that I had purchased these with the intent of cloth diapering my baby.  I had used Gerber flatfolds and prefolds on my first two children back in 2000 and 2002.  They were amazingly awesome back in the day, so I'm wondering what on earth happened.These are very thin . . . I mean see through thin.  I couldn't even use them as a changing, shoulder or lap pad in a pinch. Any baby "mishap" would immediately seep through.  Not only that, they feel very rough - not something you'd want to rub on a newborn baby's skin to clean spit-up or drool.I feel bad for giving such a poor review because I'm normally a huge fan of Gerber products.  I just think that these are pointless and a waste of money.  You can find better flatfolds for nearly the same price as these.  As far as burp cloths, the Gerber prefold diapers work awesome for those.
I do not use these as diapers, but I couldn't live w/o them.  When my baby was really little, I used them on the changing pad to keep from having to change the changing pad cover constantly.  These are much easier to change and wash than those covers.  These are also the best burp cloths.  My daughter has really bad acid reflux, and not many burp cloths can stand up to a good spit up.  I go through about 5 a day.  They are VERY absorbant!
These looked huge when I took them out of the package! Don't worry they will shrink down a little after the first wash. These are absorbent and great for burp cloths because you don't have to worry about staining them. They are very easy to wash and could potentially be bleached. After the first wash, they might not be as soft was you would wish but after a few washes this is not an issue. In short, I love them. I have 2 packages of them and I use them every day. I have cute ones that I might use outside of the house, but these are definitely my first choice.My auntie recommended them to me and I am very thankful for that! She used them with her kids and they are now a necessity in my house.
Yep, flat diapers are indispensible for baby.  But skip the Gerbers!I'd decided to cloth diaper, and got some fantastic (big, thick, soft) birdseye flats for $12 per dozen, online (Google flat diapers).At the shower I was given some of these, and I thought "cool, some cheapies for the non-diapering situations."I was shocked to find they're not that cheap, and even more shocked at the (lack of) quality.  After 5 weeks, these are still sitting untouched on the shelf, even though my tendency to grab my "diapering diapers" for everything has me running short on diapers a lot!
These are the only bottles I use and they work well.  They are very durable & dishwasher safe. I have a medela pump also. My daughter is breastfed and feeds from these well, except for with the slow flow nipples - I recommend a fast flow nipple unless you want to take over a half hour to feed your baby while he/she struggles to get the milk out.  I should mention that she is not picky (becasue some babies are)about what type/brand of nipple she uses as long as the flow is not too slow.
I was very disappointed in this product. It was highly recommended by the hospital, so I bought TWO sets of these bottles before my baby was born. After breastfeeding for about four or more weeks, I tried to get her to take a bottle and she refused the Medela nipple. We also tried the Avent nipple and she didn't like those, either. We finally ended up with the Playtex Premium. She only needed a small amount of coaxing to take those. Now she's a pro! (Anyone need my Medela set????)
The bottle quality isn't great for the price.  Dr. Brown's bottles (the narrow ones) screw right into the Pump In Style.  So you can pump and use, just as you would with these bottles. If you use regular bottles, the Evenflo set is 1/3 of the price and fits right in. Or you can buy Evenflo bottles without the nipples for $4.99 to pour into other brands of bottles.  I use Dr. Brown's - since those are pricey, when I use up all of those, I just use the Evenflo to store extra milk and pour it into the Dr. Brown's bottles.
These bottles are useful for storing milk....they are sturdy and fit in bottle warmers nicely.  My baby hates them for feeding, however.  I now just use these for storage and then pour the warmed milk into Playtex Nurser bottles.  I bought the Medela system when I was pregnant b/c I wanted what was best for my baby...and I was led to believe that Medela nipples would be most like the breast.  Um, no.  Take one look at them and it's pretty clear.  My baby wouldn't even take it in her mouth.  She instantly responded to the Playtex nipples, however.  Much, much better!
I ordered this product thinking it would be great if I could pump directly into the bottles we'd be feeding our baby with, eliminates a step right?  Well, having the extra bottles for pumping has been great and the work well in the freezer but they don't work well for feeding.  Milk seems to pour out our newborns mouth (3 mos now).  I hate pumping and really hate seeing my milk being wastes so we have stopped using the bottles to feed and only for storage.  I like the evenflow glass bottles better, she wastes very little milk with those
These bottles are great but are very pricey.  I have a 2 month old and I was producing more more milk than he was drinking allowing me to store some in the freezer.  I was hesitant to use the bags because I was afraid they would leak so I found myself wanting to buy more bottles, but for $18.99 for 6, I needed to find another alternative.  I did some research and found bottles made my Mother's Milkmate (mothersmilkmate.com or on ebay) These bottles are compatible with the Madela breast pump and nipple rings.  The refrigerator storage system is great too, you have to check out the website to understand what I mean.  If you love these bottles, you've love the milkmate ones as well.Hope this helps and saves you money!
I got the Medela bottles because I intended on breast feeding my child. Unfortunatly I was unable to do that. But these bottles work wonderfully with formula!My daughter retains much less air with the Medela nipples and she seems to prefer the shape as well. I found that when I sterilize Gerber nipples they become "gummy" and "sticky", but the Medela brand holds up very well in our sterilizer.I think the Medela bottles stand the test of time, which ends up saving you money in the long run and my baby LOVES them!
I use the pump-in-style advanced breastpump, and I really like that these bottles screw right into the pump assembly.  I like having many bottles on hand so that I don't need to wash them every day.  I don't freeze my milk in these (I use Gerber bags), but they're great for temporary storage until pouring into the feeding bottles.  I use Avent bottles as my baby seems to like the shape and flow of the newborn nipples (these nipples seem too fast-flowing).
First, these really do protect bedding against leaks and spills. Get the bed sized ones as an under layer (which adds cushioning from the plasticky mattresses that are made today), layer on the pretty sheets, then use a smaller pad under the diaper area. This protects the sheets but the very bottom pad protects your mattress in case a true accident occurs. I must admit that after washing, these pads did pill but this did not deteriorate their effectiveness. I'd go to Target for the softer, thinner, prettier, and just as effective smaller size. It's the difference between wearing a hospital pad versus a brand name pad. Both work just as well but one is more confortable on the go.
i got these to put on my bed for my son's morning massage-cuz by now it's no secret what little boys do once those nappies come off! the first time i used it i seriously used the expression "let's see how good these really are"...only to be terribly disappointed: upon turning him over (yes he did let out a dose)i found i had really let my child lay in a puddle!! this o so absorbent pad really did nothing but allow for a greater area of redistribution. i even ventured to put my hand into it to see how much was absorbed n literally had stuff dripping from my fingers!!this was a waste of my money. i am back to using a regular sheet folded over.
I love these pads! After reviewing many reviewers I decide to buy one and try it. It is so soft and absorbent! Mine has not pilled and has gone through many washings. I ended using it in my diaper bag since the changing places in public restrooms don't always appear clean. It fits so much better in my diaper bag than a bulky changing pad and my daughter likes better since not cold. I bought more of these and left one in her cosleeper for leaks and as a changing pad at night so no trips to nursery. Another was placed downstairs with wipes and diapers in a basket for quick changes on the couch and everyone loved using them.Great price and you will get your moneys worth out of them. They go anywhere and we left one at grandmas and one in the car for changing on the seat when not convenient to change elsewhere. Will use for next bundle of joy!
I have 2 packs in different sizes. On the package it's advertized as a burp cloth. I've used it over a pillow on my lap, but it's too stiff to use over your shoulder. It's good at trapping moisture and keeping the surface beneath from getting wet or damp. It stayed strong after several washes. I used to lay my daughter on it to protect her mattress or sheets, but I find that it doesn"t breathe well enough and when she had baby acne it made the break-outs much worse.
I recommend the large quilted multi-use pad in addition to the mattress pad.  I have about 4 of them and they are essential.  I use John Lennon receiving blankets (6 is a good number) with the quilted multi-use pad underneath to be prepared for spills and smudges on my contoured changing pad. I do the same on his crib to save me the headache of changing crib sheets which are very tedious to get off and on. It's nearly impossible to do when you've had a c-section, and not a good idea to strain yourself.
This product seems great.  You can use it for every purpose which involves your baby.  We have them in different sizes for the Crib, bassinett, playard, and just extra changing pads for middle of the night changes and carry around pad.  They absorb great and wash with no problems.  I tumble dry low, that way they keep their shape longer.  Take them everywhere and dont have to worry about laying your little one on hard cold surfaces when diaper changing.  Very affordable and worth every penny.  I highly recommend to every parent.
I bought two of these and I just love them.  I use both of them at the same time--one for his head, the other for his butt. They do the trick of catching spit-up, vomit, and leaking diaper problems.  These pads save me a lot of time beacuse I don't have to worry about doing the sheets all the time. They're getting a little fuzzy now that they've been through the wash a few times, but for $7, I think these pads are a great buy!!
What I like about these pads are the way the don't slip around at all when you lay them down on carpet or flannel sheets.  My daughter has started resisting being changed on her changing table, so I use these pads to change her on differnt floors in our house.  And awhile back when she had a particularly upset stomach and lots of diaper blow-outs we kept her on top of these pads all day, whether she was sleeping in her crib or anywhere.  They worked wonderfully.  They come clean easily and I don't mind that the cotton pills up.  That helps to keep it from shifting on carpeted floors.
These pads have definitely come in handy. They are super absorbent, very easy to clean and a perfect size for many different things. When my daughter first came home I used them under her, on my counter near the sink to sponge bathe her. I have one on my changing table that came with my Pack n Play. I also use on on the floor under her activity gym (Sparkling Symphony Gym)since it doesn't include a mat. I also have two at Grandma's for changing and laying on the bed. They are used frequently and really do hold up to alot of abuse. I would recommend buying a pack even if you don't think you'll need them because I guarantee they will be put to good use.
These pads are very absorbent and certainly serve the purpose, but they don't look very good after you wash them.  For the price I suppose you can't expect much, but the Carter's lap pads wash much better.  If you are going to get some, use them under things and buy the white ones.  The colors seem to show the pilling more.  I use them under the bassinett sheet now.  I used to use them on top of the changing pad, but my baby is only 2 months old and they already look quite old.
This pad is perfect for our playard. I put it under the sheet and I have no worries about trying to clean the matress board since the material cannot come off. It is very soft, provides an extra layer of padding since playards are so hard, and it can be washed and dried in the machines no problem. Even when we go on vacation we pack it up with the playard. Great investment for your babies saftey, babies confort, your sanity (when trying to wash the playard matress), and what makes this even better is the price!!!!
We have tried so many sippy cups over the years and these are the best. My kids are 6 1/2 years apart and I used these sippy cups for my oldest. For my second child we used Nuk silicone spout cups for awhile but he kept chewing the spouts. They were getting expensive to replace. I tried other hard spout cups but he didn't like them. I remembered my daughter liking these and looked around but couldn't find them. Looked on Amazon and so glad that I found them. My son loves these. They are easy to clean, don't leak and he happily drinks out of them. I have ordered several packs of them. All have been the blue and green as pictured except my last order I got purple and orange prints. I highly recommend these cups.
These cups don't spill, but the liquid comes out too fast for my daughter.  She's 8 months and still on stage 1 nipples because she chokes easily, so that's not the cups fault.  She was drinking water from these yesterday and had it running all down her chin then choked a little.  So if your baby is fine with a faster flow... go for it!  I'm hoping to use these once she's a little older since they really don't leak at all.  She kept holding it upside down and tossing it and nothing came out!
My child at a year old can sip out of them but a lot does come out.  He is getting better now after a few months of having them.  He throws this on our hard floors and nothing comes out!  It's a great cup that way, totally spillproof!  Playtex does make insulated ones which in my opinion are a lot better for two reasons.The first reason is that my childs hands do not get cold while sipping from cup and second the drink stays a lot colder a lot longer.  The valves are easy to put in and take out, my child only has water and milk still so I am not sure how well they will work for juice.
We've been using these cups since my son was around 8 months.  He had another sippy with a silicon tip and handles at first, but we wanted to introduce a cup that he could use for many years to come.  This is it!  Cups with silicone tips WILL leak if they get bent.  I can throw this cup in the diaper bag and not worry that it's going to leak.  It hasn't leaked once.  I love that this cup will fit in most cup holders.  It's super easy to clean with it's THREE parts.  You can use them as regular drinking cups for older kids.
The only time I've had one of these sippy cups leak is from operator error.  I have two kids ages 4.5 and 2.5 and have used several different brands of sippy cups and these are by far the best.  I've gotten rid of most of the sippy cups in my house but did keep these around for when my 2.5 yr old wants a drink of water in her bed at night or if my neices or nephews need one when they come over.  I loved these so much, I couldn't bring myself to get rid of them!
My wife purchased these from another store for more than twice the price so I decided to bring down the cost average after we found out that they do not leak. There is a small rubber piece that fits in the spout to control the speed that the liquid comes out. After your child gets old enough you can eliminate the rubber piece. I think these are great to use as soon as you stop using bottles. After you stop using, the rubber flow control piece you can use them until your child grows out of sippy cups or you lose them. Great choice. Highly recommended.
I have a 3 1/2 year old and a 1 1/2 year old and have had my fare share of sippy cups to use clean sometimes throw many away. I use to think that using the soft sippy cups  was a great transition from bottles..NOT!! these are the best they are easy to clean they dont leak everywhere and they hold the perfect amount of liquid. I have found that children with teeth chew on the soft tip and it is no longer leek proof which makes night time a big pain, anyways these are awsome and i defiantly recommend them. I got the purple and pink one since they very but i didnt mind its not like having a pink sippy cup makes my son gay or anything so people are so silly
While I agree these cups don't leak, they are difficult to get clean. The underside of the lid has crevasses around the mouth bit that are deep and narrow and almost impossible to get really clean.  I have been using ours for awhile and regularly sterilizing in boiling water, but the residue build up in the lid has gotten to the point where I have to toss them and buy new sippy cups. Too bad, as they are great in the no-leak department. I will be buying a kleen kanteen sippy--no leaks, stainless steel and easy to clean.
These are very convenient if your child is already using the Avent bottles. If you use a Medela pump, you can get an adapter and pump straight into these containers, eliminating a step in the breastmilk collection chain.I also find that the small sizes are convenient, especially if you normally pump four ounces or less out of one or both breasts.I didn't give this product five stars, though, because, really, these are just four more Avent bottles with a sealing disc. If you have a bunch of bottles anyway, you can just buy a pack of sealing discs for about $4 and use those instead.
These are fantastic for freezing/storing/reheating breast milk.  Unlike some of the reviews I read, I have experienced no leaking thusfar.  I use a Medela pump and transfer my milk into these containers because they have proven to be so wonderful (and they are acrylic, so reheating is much easier).  My only complaint is that they are slightly too small.  I usually pump more than 4 but less than 8 oz. and so I am forced to either use two containers or sacrifice my milk (which is too precious!).  However, I can deal with the smaller size because overall it is such a great product!
I love these breastmilk storage containers.  They make it so easy to collect the milk, cap it, and store it.  When I need the milk, I just take them out of the freezer, heat it in the bottle heater, put on a nipple and go.  They are great.  Perfect size for my baby who still only drinks about 3-4 ounces per sitting.  I will definitely continue to use these after she outgrows them for milk as baby food containers.  They are great.
I use these storage containers for mixing breast milk and rice cereal to feed my daughter while we are out.  I love these containers for this use.  I don't have any problem with leaking and I can feed my daughter straight out of the jar.I gave these 4 stars because I didn't get any use out of these for storing breastmilk in the freezer (which is why I registered for them in the first place).  It takes FOREVER to defrost the breastmilk in these bottles.  I just ended up using the Lansinoh and Gerber milk storage bags because they defrosted quickly and took up much less room in the freezer.
This is great! It's so much nicer than the hard plastic tubs. My 6 month old doesn't slide around in this and it's easy for me to rest my arm on the tub while washing her. (Couldn't do that with the plastic tub.) Easy to fill up and easy to clean up. It even has a suction cup so it doesn't slide around in the tub. (I also use that for hanging up so it dries out after every bath.) This tub just makes bathtime much easier!
I had previously purchased another tub because it was a few dollars cheaper but soon regretted it once received. The tub had two pouches to but the soap and shampoo. But the one thing i needed was a drain. The dirty water built up and the only way to get it out is to tilt it up so it can pour out. Such a hassle while washing a 9month old. Not with this one though. I can fill the tub up for him to play and splash and allow it to drain out when its time to wash. Great, so my son don't soak in dirty water which he does pee in.
This inflatable tub was perfect! A good size, no frills, and a suction cup that worked well for mounting it to the shower wall when we were finished using it. It worked great, until we started noticing slow leaks. We'd super glue one, only to find another a few weeks later. Time to buy a new tub.*Update - all the other tubs have the same negative reviews about splitting seams over time. Since this tub worked so well for us until it split and we love the suction cup, we just bought another one. Ah well.
I was worried about this purchase reading all the reviews.  So far so good.  My 9 month old son loves the water we use this in the tub for bath time where he splashes and has fun. I bought the Safety 1st Splash Infant Bath Cushion, Blue to go in it.  I use that sometimes as I don't find the bottom of the tub that slippery, my son stands up in it and doesn't slip.But I was worried about safety so I purchased the cushion.We also use it for a swimming pool, sort of.  We have had some very hot days so I take it out side on my deck putting a old blanket underneath & he just sits in it and plays.I like it also when he has diaper rash as I can put the baking soda in the water to help dry it up and the height of the tub allows me to get it high enough over his butt.
I couldn't find anywhere--not on amazon nor on the product or its packaging--what this tub is made of, but I suspect it might be made of PVC. It has a strong new-shower-curtain/new-pool-toy smell when you first open it, and I let it air out for a few days before using it. The smell is gone now, but I would have loved it if this tub were made of a less smelly (and probably more eco-friendly) material.Also, the tub doesn't fit directly under the faucet--half the water goes in the inflatable tub, and half of it goes between the inflatable tub and the side of the bathtub. I fill a large plastic bowl with water and dump it into the tub to fill the tub.Other than these issues, the tub is ok. The size is good and it does the job.
We used this tub for my baby from about 7 or 8 months old until about 13 months.  It was a great transition from our infant bathtub, giving her more space without using all the water that a full bath would require.  It only took moments to inflate by mouth, and I never needed to add more air.  I liked being able to use the tub in the middle of the big tub so my baby was never in close proximity to the faucet or water controls.  The vinyl is a nice quality, and I ended up using it outdoors as a small wading pool at my mother's house after the baby outgrew it for bath purposes.  Once she started walking it was not long that she learned how to climb out of the sides, but I'm very happy with the job that this tub did for the months we were able to use it!
My son outgrew his infant tub so I tried to bath him in a regular tub - wasn't having it!  So I needed something fast that could act as a transition tub.  This fit the bill.  I would recommend buying a hand pump to fill it (just be very careful).  I tried to blow it myself and nearly passed out!  I used the pump from my exercise ball and it was inflated and ready to go in minutes.  Just place the plug in the hole and fill!  I am not sure why people have complained about it being slipper - my son stands up just fan when I have to wash his bottom.  He loves it!  My only complaint is that the bottom leaves...um...rear end stains so make sure you keep it clean or at least pre-clean your babies bottom before putting them in.  I always do so I don't know how it stains but it does!
We got this for our 7 month old twins who have just started sitting up alone but are still a bit wobbly.  The tub is really cute but the bottom panel on the one we got had a leak and would not stay inflated, which completely defeats the purpose of creating a soft surface for them.  We ended up putting the infant bath sponge that we used when they were newborns in the bottom and sitting them on that.  They had a great time splashing and playing.  It's a great tub if you get one that holds air.
When my daughter outgrew her infant tub, we went through a few different devices to try to give her a safe bath. She is VERY active so she doesn't like to sit for very long. We first tried the bath ring, that was a disaster. This snug tub has worked wonderfully. She is able to stand in it and splash around without us worrying about her breaking her head if she slips. It's very safe and fits snugly in our shower. I highly recommend this tub, especially if you have toddler who won't sit through baths!
I'm very satisfied with this affordable blow up tub.  The bottom part under the baby's butt blows up separately than the sides, which is nice because my 6 month old was unstable sitting on the blown up bottom at first.  She loves the ability to play in the water in here, I just have a hard time keeping her sitting in the tub, she keeps wanting to stand up and climb the bathtub walls. I think that's more an issue with my very active daughter than the tub though :)
I wanted this to use for the baby while I showered, and for him to play in while I dried off. We have a standard sized tub and this took up so much room that I had to step into it to enter or exit the tub. It would be ok for somebody who was sitting next to the tub while baby bathed, as it would save time and water not having to fill the whole tub.I had some problems with mold, and boy is it tough to get off once it's there. I tried scrubbing with vinegar and baking soda, and some bleach. It mostly came off but was still in the cracks. Honestly, we got more use putting this in the back yard during summertime, and now it's getting tossed out.
I purchased this inflatable tub for my son because I wanted to have a portable tub for when I went traveling with him. This tub is great, I even use it at home. I started using this tub when my son was 6 months, he is now 9 months old. Now that he sits up on his own, it's a lot easier to bathe him. I like using this tub better than an infant bath seat because I can wash him more thoroughly, all around instead of having his legs fastened in a tub seat. If you travel, it's a great idea to get an inflatable tub, it's portable, and quite sturdy.
My little one outgrew her baby tub around 5 months old. I purchased this item and read the previous reviews. Great item...its cushy for baby and quite large for her and her toys :)  Another great thing is even if the suction cup is wet, it still sticks to the bath tub wall without any problems and doesn't deflate easily (it's been about 2 months and still have not had to inflate the tub since I've purchased the item).Only CON is that as a previous reviewer had mentioned, the tub is slippery. So I bought the Green Spouts bathmat to put in the tub so my daughter does not slip and slide everywhere.
This is a nice enough tub but nothing special enough to warrant five stars.  I like the Safety 1st Kirby Inflatable Tub better than this one because it is deeper and the bottom plug is cushioned better the SnugTub's.  The SnugTub is slightly longer, though, and that was a key issue.  Why doesn't someone invent a larger toddler tub?  We're trying to postpone having to waste a lot of water filling the entire adult bathtub for our growing toddler's baths.  A vinyl tub that is 9 or 10 inches high and 30 inches long would be perfect and sell well.  There must be lots of other parents looking for a similar transitional tub!
The DEX Pillow is great.  I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and I am 21 weeks along.  The pillow is not overly big and fits nicely under the belly.  I tried the fully body boppy pillow, but had trouble sleeping with it and I had trouble with having to adjust it again after turning over.  This pillow is easy to change sides with.  Before pregnancy I slept on my belly.  I find that this pillow has really helped me transition from being a belly sleeper to a side sleeper.
It is a small pillow, most useful underneath another pillow to give you a little elevation. It's really too uncomfortable to lay directly on it, maybe if you just wanted to put it between your legs it'd be okay. I don't think I'd call this a "pregnancy pillow" - it's too small. My wife needed full upper body elevation and a pillow 1/4 the size of her back (and only 4" tall) isn't going to help. However this worked good for just head elevation (with another pillow on top).
I think we bought this for $8. I was in the market for a snoogie but couldn't bring myself to pay $60 for a pillow I would only use for a few months. I am 7 months along and I didn't realize that I needed to 'lift' my belly a bit. Works great. A lot more sturdy than I thought. I'm glad it's not memory foam because I need a 'lift' not to sink in. I gave it 4 stars only because I have 2-3 more months to go in my pregnancy.A great buy! A great little size that does the job.
I'm in my 3rd tri and have been sleeping with a snoogle but was finding that my belly wasn't getting the support when I had my back to the snoogle --so I ordered this.  But overall, it's just ok.  It's very firm so not super comfortable but I still use it.  But I'm not sure if I would feel like I needed it if I didn't already buy it.  After seeing the Boppy wedge, I would have ordered that instead because it's much softer.  The drawback to this wedge is that if you wedge too much of it under your belly, it hurts your back --defeating the whole purpose.
I got this pillow and when it arrived I was disappointed. I purchased it intending to use it to prop my torso up at night during my 2 trimester. It was much smaller than I realized and tossed it aside. A few weeks later I started using it between my knees while I slept on my side. I also used it under my growing belly so It wouldn't hang. I found myself using it behind my back during TV time and also in the car. I used it all the time. Right now, I am letting a friend borrow it for her back at work since she is in her third trimester. I would recommend this pillow to anyone so has back issues or is pregnant. The case comes off so you can clean it too.
This pillow is smaller than a standard sized bed pillow.  It is just enough to wedge under my hip & keep me off of my vena cava (now 7 months along.)  It does not solve all of my comfort issues, but it gives me peace of mind that I'm not laying flat while I sleep (which I find myself doing without it.)  It seems like it will fit perfectly in my bassinet after the baby is here to elevate her head.  And when I'm done using it for that, it will make a perfect knee-separator pillow.  I have already gotten my $10 worth & forsee using it for a long time to come.
I'm 28 weeks pregnant, and have been having trouble sleeping with the extra tummy weight so I thought this would help.  However, this didn't really help me sleep better at all, if anything it made it worse.  It was very uncomfortable.  Maybe I'll try it again later when my tummy gets even bigger.***UPDATE***  Now that I am 33 weeks, I use this support pillow every night.  Once my tummy got bigger, the pillow was no longer uncomfortable and actually helps support my belly very much.  Now I can't sleep without it!
As other reviewers have mentioned, this is not for car seats.  However, it doesn't have to do with crash testing issues.  The technician who installed my car seat told me to never ATTACH anything to my car seat (including toys) that didn't come with the seat, and the way these headrests fit, that is considered to be attached.  The reason had to do with how your baby will fit in the seat.  It's the same reason you are not supposed to put your baby in a car seat when he or she is extremely bundled up- you end up securing the clothing more than the baby.  The technician did recommend the rolled blanket idea- the blankets will not cause harm to your baby in a crash, and they do not interfere with how the baby fits in the seat at all.I am using mine in the stroller and his swing.  It works well for these items.  I give it three stars because it is not totally useless.
This headrest is perfect.  Since day one my daughter has been comfy using this.  When she was teeny tiny the insert kept her head from flopping forward.  Now that she is bigger we use it without the insert and she's still happy.  At 4 months she has wonderful head control, but I wouldn't put her in her carseat without this.  I tried the head rest that came with her Graco car seat and it was terrible.  It sort of lets her head roll all over when we carry her from the house to the car.  For a small baby I wouldn't even think about using the flimsy headrest they give you with the seat.
I returned the headrest that I received at my baby shower.  I found that the items I needed to use it with (the carseat, the stroller, the swing, etc.), came with their own headrest.  Also, parents should know, that when I had my carseat checked by the sheriff department's trained carseat safety deputy, I was told NOT to use one of these in a carseat UNLESS the seat comes with one that is made to specially fit that seat.  Using one in a seat that it wasn't made for can cause your child to fit improperly in the seat, putting them at greater risk for injury.  The product may be a fine one, but I found an &quot;extra&quot; one to be unnecessary.
I don't really know if this thing works or not because my 8 mo old refuses to have anything to do with it. Keep in mind that she puts anything & everything in her mouth, will eat any food I try to feed her & is currently teething. It seems like a great idea for that short transition period between mush & solids. This particular one appealed to me because it's not dyed & it's made in the USA. As to whether or not it works? I will never know!
This item seems like a good idea, but after purchasing two I feel that we've fallen victim to "new parent baby marketing". Our baby wasn't interested at all in sucking on anything in it. She woudln't even go for fruits that we knew she loved. I'm guessing the mesh is too distracting or annoying to them(?) She would just shake it around, bang it, or throw it. Also, it's a total pain to clean it. The netting never gets clean in the dishwasher.Save your money on this one.
At first I really liked this. My 9 month old daughter loved munching on fruit with this. But, when I tried to clean it I realized that it was a bit more work than I expected. You can purchase new netting for it but why spend the extra money when you can buy one by Munchkin at Target for less? The Munchkin brand has a levered top so you don't have a bunch of seperate parts to monkey with. Also - not to be weird but on a taste test the Munchkin brand had no taste while this one seemed to have a little, bitter taste. For $3.00 go with the Munchkin one. You will need to not only run it through the dishwasher but also give it a thorough once over. Sometimes little bits if food gets stuck in the netting (but in this one and the munchkin brand). Whichever you decide to go - this is a great invention!
What a great way to introduce baby to fresh fruit &amp; veggies. No choking! I admit the older style bags were hard to clean (Oxy clean and an overnight soak in hot water in a cup before a top-rack dishwasher run did get it clean, but was messy and took extra time).Now, new easy-clean/disposable bags are here! Look for them out there--our BRU had them recently. Pitch them if they're really bad, but just unscrew bag from ring, scrub or soak both and voila, put back together and re-use. Then throw them away as the bags age, tear or stain.Alex has used ours since 4 months of age and our original bags plus newer replacements are still going strong at 10 months, with repeated dishwasher-ing.
I purchased this product a few months ago despite all the bad reviews and so far I have not had a problem with it. My son loves it. I've had this sitting in the sink (dirty) for days sometimes and I have never once had a problem cleaning it. The best way I figured out on cleaning this product is to just clean it with hot water and dish detergent and clean out the inside really good with the same type of brush that you use to clean out the bottles. Even the bananas come out and who cares if its a little stained as long as you know that its clean. I was in the store the other day and saw a similar version of this item made by Munchkin at less than half the price of this one. I wish I found it before because this baby safe feeder is a little outrageous in price for this kind of item. I would still  definately recommend this product though.
I received this as a shower gift from my sister-in-law.  When I received it, I had NO idea what is was or what it was for.  Needless to say, my perception of this has significantly changed (for the BETTER!) I use this for my 7 1/2 month old son with canned pears, pieces of apple and canned peaches...Just cut up the canned fruits/veggies to fit in the bag, and let your little one have at it! Better yet, when they're teething, freeze cubes of juice, and put the cube(s) in the bag--they'll thank you for it! They'll throughly enjoy feeding themselves (albeit making a mess too)...but more importantly, they are LEARNING to feed themselves as well as about the textures and consistencies of food other than the pureed versions they're so used to.  It's durable and EASY to clean, and replacment "bags" are found pretty much any child store.
We started using this feeder when my son was just 3 months old.  He loved the flavor of melon, but we were uncomfortable with letting him bite on a piece of melon for fear he might choke.  The baby feeder was the perfect answer.You can cut up just about anything and place it in the feeder bag.  We even put lightly frozen grapes in it when my son was teething.  We used it mostly for fruit, especially melon, grapes, pears, and strawberries.  I will admit that it can be messy to use this feeder, but it was totally worth it to us to give our son a chance to learn to love fresh fruits.  Enjoy!!!!
I bought this to help with teething and help my baby explore new food without choking.  Overall , it's pretty good.  I think you can buy this one and not the "Starter Kit."  All you really need is one set.  I have tried it with ice, which she loves, and peas and a frozen peach.  It is a huge mess, which I can deal with.  The main issue I have with it is that the mesh is pretty thick so it's hard for her to actually get any food out of it.  It is easy to clean and she likes it overall.  I wouldn't say this is one of my indispensable baby items though.
It was okay while it lasted but then the mesh started unraveling at the seams. I like the concept of this but in practical use, my 7.5 month old wasn't thrilled about using this. The handle is a bit heavy and I wondered why they couldn't make it a little lighter to hold. My baby ends up holding onto the mesh part of this b/c the handle is too heavy for her. Eating out of this does get really messy but that's going to happen any time babies try to feed themselves. In comparison to the Munchkin Feeder I bought, this is nice in that the handle screw off but the Munchkin feeder is much more durable and the mesh is easier to clean.
I think this is a great idea. I only used it a couple times for foods. At that time she was having trouble mastering how to hold the handle and soon after that she was able to pick up foods on her own and was pretty good at chewing. I LOVE this product for when she is teething. I put a couple ice cubes in it and wet it under the faucet so it doesn't stick to her lips. She gets upset when the ice is gone. My daughter is 11 months and has been teething almost none stop since 3 months...Currently she is cutting her first molars and this helps for her to suck on it and get the cold water back farther than a teething ring would.
I had been using the Gerber bags for quite a while when I ran out and decided to try some of the Medela bags that came with my pump.I frequently just couldn't seem to get the bags to completely seal - and I had NEVER had this problem with the Gerber bags.I always ended up making a mess when trying to use the 'spout' at the bottom of the bag.And the worst part - I didn't realize the twist-ties were cutting into the sides of the bags on more than one occasion.  I took the bag out of the freezer and into the fridge to thaw and ended up with a shelf full of breastmilk.Maybe these bags work for supermoms, but they didn't work well for busy, sloppy me.  Apparently I can handle a ziploc baggie but not a twist tie!
I registered for and received these Medela bags.  After using all 50, I got a few free Lansinoh bags with my breast pad purchase.  Wow!! I will never go back to Medela.  The reason I registered for them is because everyone says they are strong and don't leak.  Well this is the only good feature.  The Lansinoh bag is strong as well, easy to close (DOUBLE zip-lock Vs. Medela's bothersome twisty ties), easy to get the air out (unlike Medela's), and the Lansinoh's take-up WAY less room in the freezer! Stacking Medela bags in the freezer is difficult because of their shape...and thawing will be difficult because I can see I'll need to watch that the milk doesn't spill out the top.  With Lansinoh I won't have to worry about that.  My medela bags haven't split in the freezer...I'll give them that.  But neither has my Lansinoh bag.
I think that I've tried every bag that I have found and have been disappointed with all of them.  These were just about the worst!!  My daughter was born prematurely and never really got the hang of breastfeeding.  I wanted her to recieve all of the benefits of breastmilk so I pumped.  I have pumped everday since the day she was born btwn 5 and 8 times a day.  I went through ALOT of bags (I use bottles now) and these were a pain.  They were small, thin, punctured easily, and those twist ties (although pumping directly into the bag is a great concept) were just a pain in the butt.  I love Medela's pumps (I own the Pump in Style Advanced, a seperate manual pump, and used the Lactina hospital pump for 3 months), I like their storage bottles, I even like their nipple cream, but these bags need some more work put into them.
I really liked the Medela products at first, but I never really liked these bags, mainly because you have to tie them with a folded over twist tie to close them.  If you get too much milk in the bag, it will leak when you close it up.  Then one of my bags tipped over in the freezer and it leaked, causing a frozen puddle of breast milk in my brand new freezer to clean.  Plus, the bag got stuck in the puddle.I have also used the Gerber bags, and I liked those much better.
I had some of these that came with my Medela pump and like some other reviewers I thought they would be a good deal since I've really liked my Medela pump.  I really didn't like using them with the twist ties.  That didn't make sense to me at all.  I tried the First Years that have a zip-loc top and they've worked better.  They sit on their own and don't need to be set in a cup!I do prefer using bottles to store milk and have found the Mother's Milk Mate storage bottles to be a great cheap alternative for storage bottles.
If I had to freeze breastmilk, this was great because I didn't have to put a lot of plastic containers in the freezer (we could use them to feed the baby instead).  They were easy to dispose of if they outdated (there is a place to label them with the date).  I usually put 3 of them in a freezer bag as a double layer of protection against leaks and freezer burn.  None ever leaked for me.  They thaw easier and faster than in hard plastic or glass containers, too.  Very convenient.
If you are looking to make a mess, lose milk and get frustrated, these are the bags for you.  First, these bags do no stand up on there own and it is very inconveniant to carry a little cup around to help fill the bag. You have to string the twist-tie into each bag by yourself.  Also you are supposed to tear the little tab on the bottom of the bag to get the milk out.  It's not that easy.  The first time I did it I lost a whole bunch of milk.  Your better off untwisting the tie and pouring it from there.  The worst thing about the bag is that they have leaked a few times that my caregiver was warming up the milk.  This never happened with the other bags on the market.  My favorite is lansinoh.  Another bag thing about these Medela bags are that they are more expensive than the others.  Pass on this and try others.
These bags leave a lot to be desired.  They don't stand up on their own so you have to set them in a cup when they have milk in them.  They don't lie down flat, so you can't freeze them in a nice flat layer to stack in the freezer.  The twist-tie top causes the bags to freeze with a lot of folds and ridges at the neck - this made it impossible for me to open a frozen bag to add more milk later on.  And I've never been able to tear open the little tab at the bottom to get the milk out - I have to snip the edge with a scissors, which I'm sure defeats the purpose of having a nice, sterile inside.  All in all, I'm really disappointed in these bags, and the only positive side to them is I haven't had any burst in the freezer...yet.
I purchased these bags when I returned to work and began pumping more often.  What a waste!!  The twist tie design is both clumsy and ineffective.  You can never tie them tight enough and spills are frequent.  In additon to this, the cost is ridiculous.  The Gerber bags with the zip lock design are much more economical and are leak proof.  They can be found at most retail stores including Target and Walmart. These bags do not measure up to the Medela name and they should consider a new design. Returning to work and continuing to nurse your baby is hard enough without the hassle of these bags.
I love this gadget.  I bought two extra bases for my infant car seat for both my husband's and my mother's car.  Unlike my car, there center seat has a harness strap.  Those are hard to get really tight.  My center seat has just the lap belt and it was easy to secure the base.  With the harness strap it was just too hard to get the seat in tight enough.  With the mighty tight, it was a snap.  You just hooked it in, cranked it, and voula!!!That seat isn't going anywhere.  I love it.  It is easy to use, it makes the seat secure, and it is sturdy.  You must have this if you are trying to secure a seat in a position with a shoulder harness.
Something like this is a great idea, but when I called to ask the fire dept. to inspect my car.  They said not to add any after-market things to car seats or seat belts. The firefighter said this could weaken the seat belt over time and it may break in a crash. They also said that the headrest for the infant seat was dangerous because it adds more room between baby and the seat, which may cause the baby to be injury seriously in an accident.I took both out of my car. The mighty tite is just collecting dust.  I have no plans of using it or giving it away.  If I can't find a use for it, I'll probably throw it away.  The headrest is in the bouncer or the swing. They are great for around-the-house everyday use.
We had gotten this seat belt tighter for both our cars - a Subaru Outback and an Audi A4.  For the Subaru, the Mighty-Tite was too bulky to work well - it was pushed up against the car seat and it was difficult to tighten completely.  It fit well on the Audi, but when we got our car seat installation inspected, the police office checking our seat said that she did not recommend this product.  She has actually had one break while installing it!  Since it is not made by the car manufacturer and not made by the car seat company, you should be wary of being lulled into a false sense of security just because you have this product.
I bought this sheet because I believed everything should be &quot;form fitting&quot; if my son was to be in it - to prevent possible suffocation, choking....This sheet was so rough I could not lay my baby on it.  After washing 3-4 times with loads of fabric softener - no difference.I used it once and it's been in the closet ever since.I ended up putting a thin blanket in the packnplay and tucking it into the sides instead.  It was soft, and when my child was sleeping he didn't pull it out.If and when I use the pack and play as a playpen, I may pull the sheet out and try again.  For the basinett - don't bother.
We own these sheets and they are great specially for my nephew..they seem "thin" but actually they are not to thin...i washed them many times from baby puke...these sheets has saved our travel yard from the evil smell of vomit! and i put a light weight blanket under him (on top of the sheet.) when he was a newborn/1month old...these sheets kept our play yard very clean!! and we love them and will buy more when baby #2 comes! we also have the yellow one and this green one..they both get used daily and washed daily (if puke happens) and we love the easy on and easy off!
I bought this item (in a different color) two years ago for my son.It is NOT waterproof- but what SHEET is?!  I recommend purchasing a 27" size BRU Especially for Baby Brand waterproof pad to go under the sheet (Just like you would buy a waterproof cover for your crib mattress!).  The sheet will hold the pad in place and fit perfectly over top both the pad and mattress.This sheet is durable and launders easily.I was so pleased with this product, I would purchase it again!  In fact, I did!  I am expecting TWINS, so I purchased another sheet in this color and also TWO of the smaller size for my two Graco Travel Lite Cribs/PNP's.Good job, Graco for coming up with yet another GREAT product!
We have a Baby Trend playyard, and these sheets fit perfectly.  I only use the sheets when we're traveling and my son uses the playyard to sleep in, and I haven't had any problem with the sheets coming off during sleep (and he's pretty active at night!).I will agree that these sheets are lint magnets.  Also, they're not the softest sheet in the world, but that does make them a bit more durable.  However, since we just use them at night, I would have liked a bit softer sheet.  The sheet is also quite thin.The best thing is to not have high expectations for this sheet.
I got this sheet for my son's Colby Pack n Play as a spare for when his original aheet requires washing.  There's not much to say about a sheet. To me, a sheet's a sheet.  The price could have been a bit better but the color is nicer and doesn't show stains as much as some lighter colored sheets do.  I would recommend this over white, yellow, certain blues and pinks.  For the purpose I got this for I have no qualms.  We haven't had any bleeds and the sheet isn't stiff or scratchy.  I would never use this long term but for short term use this is convenient.  I'm glad I got it and I have no complaints but there is only so much raving you ca do about a piece of fabric so I say, buy it as a backup.  You will need it, especially for preemies, newborns and teething babies/toddlers because they can go through several sets of bedcloths a day.
I also almost didn't buy these sheets because of the reviews on this site, but I couldn't find another brand either, so I picked up two of these in navy.The sheets are a bit on the thin side (they are the thinnest sheets we own for him), but since our son has been sleeping in the bassinet in our room since day one, they are the only sheets he's ever slept on. They are okay sheets that are holding up very well, even through numerous washings. Oh, and they aren't elasticized, but it is so tricky to get them on the bassinet, I have no worries that they will come up (we haven't used the play yard feature yet).By the way, we've been using them all through a hot Colorado summer; if this were winter I would definitly be looking for something softer and cozier.
Bought a hundred dollar pack and play and this was my ONLY option for a sheet.  Can't they make the cheap one and a higher end sheet for those who don't mind spending money for better quality??Also, keep in mind your wash loads.  I bought this in navy and then realized that everything else I have for baby is pastels.  Sheet has to be washed seperately from rest of baby's laundry.  Would be better to choose a lighter color that could go into the same load as the rest of the baby's laundry.
I have been through 4 brands of disposables and also have several pairs of these. At first when I was sore and using nipple cream, I used the disposables. The yellow cream stains, so I didn't want to mess up my good pads. After I no longer needed cream, I moved on to the washable ones. I think they are so much softer and more comfortable than the disposables. I forget that I even have them on. I agree with other posters that they may not be as discreet as some of the disposables, but I don't really care. I don't wear too many tight clothes these days and if I did I could use disposables (to me the J&J and Avent disposables are the most discreet). I don't leak much anymore, so these are plenty sufficient to collect leakage. I have four pair. I generally do laundry once a week, with one load at some point mid-week. I'm able to always have some on hand.
I bought these to help with leaks during engorgement after giving birth. My nipples were raw, sore and a little bloody. Even though I coated my nipples with lanolin after every feeding the pads would still stick to my nipples.  My breasts and nipples already hurt so to have to peel these pads off every two hours was torture.  To make things worse little strands of cotton would dry themselves onto the cracked bleeding parts. Ouch! I found the smooth, cool lycra of my bras was better. A waste of money!
I bought these to use during the day at work and so far they've worked great. They're easy to wash and dry, I just throw them in with my regular clothes. I didn't give it 5 stars because you can't wear these with thin clothes or they show. I wear them with a bra that has light padding so it works great that way, but if you wear a thin bra with a silk shirt or dress it would show. I love them though and I still have an unopened box of disposable bra pads that I received as a gift and will probably not use. I bought two packs and might get another one so that I don't have to wash them during the week. Why buy disposables? Seems pretty wasteful to me.
I was hoping to find a more eco way of dealing with leakage than using disposables. These work in terms of absorption for me (I should qualify that to mean I leak but generally during feedings or at night and not profusely, but enough to soak 50% of the surface of my bra at a time).Unfortunately, they are so thick they show through my more tailored clothes (flowy, patterned tops seem to remedy much of this problem). The stitching is rough and itchy. Once the pad is washed it's very ripply and won't sit flat (which is the biggest annoyance for me). They're great if you plan on being a slovenly hermit at home, but I wouldn't want to wear them in public.
I nursed our son for about 7 weeks without this, like many mothers, slouching and what not was killing my already injured back, a friend of mine had one and i tried it...loved it! Ordered one for myself and cant do without. Even ordered an addiotional one for my grandparents house that we are going to in the next week in another state! Highly recommend and I will definantly be using this for our other babies to come!Thanks Medela for once again, making an outstanding product...also...If anyone is having problems with there child- reguardless of age-- lactching on or nipple soreness or whatever......I recommend the medela nipple shield, I used it for latch on problems and immediately my son nurses just fine, its for temporary use but I have been using it non stop sense my son was born..keeps me from being sore! You can buy it at Target or anywhere Medela products are sold.I own the pump in style advanced... get this one, its worth every penny!
This nursing stool drastically improved the usefulness of my old-fashioned rocking chair as a place to nurse my newborn. Prior to the stool my lap was slanted in a way that made it difficult to position baby and my back was leaned too far back to be useful. The stool converted my lap into a flat horizontal stretch that could support my baby and improved my posture so I didn't end my sessions with a backache. However, I also found it useful while nursing on the couch or other armchairs (same benefits) and my husband loves to use it when he is getting baby dressed after a bath as it helps him keep his lap horizontal as well. An added bonus is that it is incredibly easy to put together (5-10 minutes tops) and comes with it's own allen wrench tool.
Can't say enough good things about this stool. I used one at my lactation consultant's office and found it really helpful. It gets your body in the right position and makes nursing so much more comfortable. It's well made and easy to assemble. I am not too tall - 5'3" with legs on the shorter side. Maybe if you have longer legs you don't need a stool, but I would recommend it to any new mom planning to breast feed. In my experience, anything to make those first few weeks easier - while you and your baby are learning to breast feed - is worth it!
I have been having horrible back problems since the third trimester of my pregnancy. And things got worse when my son was born. I simply could not get comfortable while breastfeeding, and was having trouble maintaining good posture, so my back was getting worse and worse. I ordered this stool thinking it would help me get comfortable and sit straight. Unfortunately, it has not helped me at all.I think one main problem is that I am very short: 5'1" and change. When I sit on my couch, my feet don't reach the stool. So it doesn't help me there. While I sit on the miniature recliner in my baby's room, my feet do reach, but the sticky pads on the feet of the stool are not sticky enough. So if I put any weight on the stool at all, it slides away from me in seconds.This is a nice product, and well made. I just wish it worked for me. :(
I didn't think a stool could really make it more comfortable to nurse, but I was wrong!  I used this with an old rocking chair and found that my legs were much more comfortable when propped up - especially during those long nights of rocking!  The stool is well-built and comes ready to use in the box.  The natural wood color is attractive and goes with nearly any decor (just so happens that my crib and baby armoire are also natural wood color).  I imagine this would be a great stool to use if you were nursing on a chair or couch that was stationary as well.
Once you have this stool, you will use it long after you stop nursing. It is wonderful for just propping your feet up while reading, watching TV, doing needlework, and much more. I have a rocker/glider that I use in my front room and the gliding ottoman is just awkward and bulky. I was using a regular child's step stool but have had to tip it onto two legs and I'm starting to notice some wear on my carpet. It is also easier to pick up and move out of the way than the ottomans or switch to the couch.
This stool is a miracle worker for tired legs and backs.  I love to use it when nursing my son upstairs.  The slanted top means your feet are positioned perfectly for holding a baby.  It's very sturdy and doesn't slide around on the floor like my daughter's plastic stools do.I did not get this until baby #2, and I wish I had had it with the first one!  Believe me, there is no comparison between rocking/nursing/holding a baby with this stool, or just resting your feet on the floor.Definitely in my "top ten" list of must-haves for breastfeeding.
I registered for this stool when pregnant, thinking it would be a nice position-helper while breast feeding, and it is, with one drawback: it tips easily if you put any weight on the edges (top edge or either side). So far, this hasn't been a huge problem, except for making a loud THUMP every time I do it, which sometimes startles the baby. I would just suggest that you avoid ever using it as an actual stool and never step or stand on it, and keep any little kiddos away from it too.Other than the potentially dangerous tipping thing, it is a nice wood piece and went together very easily. As stated before, I would not use it in place of a safer flat stool, but it would be absolutely great under a desk to prop up your feet while working.
We have a white crib and the last set of these I bought (years ago) were discolored. These are clear, and look and fit great on our crib. You should definitely measure the width and thickness of the area you want to protect though. I know some people did not, and wrote poor reviews about it when it was clearly buyer error. Our son figured out how to remove the other ones we had, but not these. So far, our nice crib is saved, hopefully for baby #2.
These are great if you have an infant who learned to stand up in their crib and decided it was time to sharpen their new teeth on the rails (which I think almost every infant is!). in other words these are a must. I have only 1 problem with these (hnce 4 stars). no mater how you try to group them, they do not cover the entire rail on any side of my baby's crib (standard size). At least 2 inches on each side are still left bare for her to chew on. The company should change their length in order to be able to provide complete coverage at elast for standard crib sizes.
I liked this product because it's a good rubbery material to chew on, but it only fit on the sides of our crib as the front bar is much wider. I had actually gotten these & put them on when my daughter was in the crib, but after being on a few months, they almost looked kind of liquidy underneath and when I went to remove them, they removed some of the wood varnish as well, so I left them on to look better. My daughter actually never did bite on the crib railings but my son does (3yrs later) and prefers chewing on the front bar best, of course. At least the side bars they fit on will not be used when it's converted to a full size bed, but there will still be those teeth marks on the bed footer. Oh well, it's kind of cute. I plan to use one of those wood color markers to cover the teeth marks if it really bothers me.
I like the idea but in reality didn't work for us.  We would have had to order 3 sets to cover the 4 sides of his crib which gets pricey. The length (from top to bottom) is not enough for his crib either - his rails are more like 2 or 3 inches.  So he can get his bottom chompers underneath these and still go to town on the wood. And of course he pulls them off easily and throws them to the floor too (11 months).  I'm going to order some cloth ones that can be safely tied on-not interested in a DIY project when it comes to ties and cribs.
This power cord protector seems to be working fine so far. My baby isn't one to pry her little fingers into the hole on top so that hasn't been an issue for us. It comes with outlet plugs, which were handy for the empty ones. I don't find the pieces that hook it together difficult to line up. Many people had commented they were difficult so I actually opened and closed it multiple times to test it out. No problem. It takes some minor concentration to line the pieces up. And it is actually white, not the yellow it appears to be in the photo.
This is challenging to get open and closed for the adult in the equation. There are a series of little pegs that must fit into little holes to get it to latch. But they are quite challenging to get to line up correctly and heaven forbid you need to get it back open. Now you would think that that's the point of the power strip cover, right? Except the hole that allows the cords to come out the top is so wide that my 9 month old just sticks his hand right inside and can put a finger in the socket. It does come w a couple outlet plugs for the extra slots in your power strip, I was just hoping this would work a wee bit better. If all you really need is to prevent your child from unplugging things from your power strip, than this will work for you.
The opening on this is too narrow to accommodate iPhone/iPod/MacBook adapters.  If the cover were taller, it wouldn't be an issue because the whole adapter could fit inside, but it's not.  It's just too short, even for the smallest of the Apple adapters.  So I had to return this anyway, but if I'd kept it, I would only have wanted to use it for a power strip that I never need to add/remove plugs on -- the tabs to open the cover are a serious pain...and ironically would be easier to open if my hands were smaller.
I have a basic single row power strip, and i couldn't shut the smaller side door or it would depress the power switch... therefore making this completely useless to me.The snap buttons are hard to open and close, so it would be good to keep little fingers out, but i just couldnt use it for my power strip.The stip i have is SIMILAR to this one,&lt;...>but not exactly the same. Mine is dark color and newer looking with spots labeled "adapter" so you can plug in large plugs and not lose any outlet space.
We are fortunate in the design of our computer desk.  A baby safety gate did the trick for us. Instead of installing a power strip safety cover, I purchased an inexpensive tension safety gate (ten bucks) and pushed it way back under the desk against the wall with all the cords and boxes (routers etc.) behind it.  Keeps his little hands out of everything and I still have room for my chair & feet.  Still trying to find the best solution for protection for 2 other strips in our home. Seems like nothing is perfect.
Great Idea. Doesnt work on plugs that are bulky and go sideways. But will work for most plugs even some large ones. The reason i gave it a 3 stars is because two reasons.One the wires come out the top making it hard to put them in a cord hider. Two bc they do come out of the top by daughter can still grab and chew on them. Would be better if they had the wires group together out the side. I saw a more expensive version of this that did that.
These have worked very well for us.  We have power strips of a couple different sizes in our house, and this fits over all of them.  It is large enough to cover all the bulky plugs we have plugged into the strips as well.  I was surprised to read another reviewer found this too small.  I think the cover should work for most single-wide power strips; it probably wouldn't work for a powerstrip with two rows of outlets.  I found it relatively easy to open and close.  I don't think my baby daughter will be able to open them herself, and she won't be able to reach her fingers in and shock herself.  I now own at least five of these.
This is one of the worst products created for child safety. It didn't fit our standard power cord, the front section opened really easily (actually had a hard time getting it to stay closed) and once we opened the back section to plug things in, couldn't get the back section closed again. Also, the opening at the top is huge! Definitely big enough for my 9-month old to stick her fingers in, which is kind of the opposite of its purpose. I sent it back and moved around furniture to hide our power cords instead.
We got this for the power strip in our livingroom by our tv.  It does a great job of hiding the strip and the plugs and I like that you can open the part of the on/off switch separate from the section where the plugs are.  But there also lies the problem with this.  The clips on the side are not easy to reattach.  So as long as you don't plan on opening and closing this a lot then it works great.... but if you need a cover over a strip that you need to access a lot, then this one will most likely frustrate you quickly!
It's not flimsy to me at all.  Maybe because the carpeting in our apartment stabalizes it, but it's perfect.  I also think it's very pretty - it brightened up the room.  I just love it.  Makes me want to further decorate the room for the baby.  Perfect height for me as well and plenty of storage room.  I do wish the pad furnished was a bit thicker and softer but it's sufficient.  I like how it's covered in smooth vinyl so we can clean it very easily.  Great table for a great price!
I bought this changing table at a used baby store because I recieved the crib as a hand me down. Even being used this changing table is great. There are no problems. It's very sturdy and durable for the price. I have the shelves loaded up with alot of things and no problems at all. The shelves are made of a type of posterboard wood but they are sturdy. The pad that came with it is very thin and cheap so I purchased a better one. But this changing table is definitely worth the moderate price.
I was going to get the "spindle" changing table from POttery Barn Kids but found this one, at about 1/3rd of the price. This one is even better b/c of the rail that goes around the actual changing area.. i do recommend a contoured changing pad with a comfy cover. i have attached a crib mobile to this table to keep katie happy during diaper time. this changing table looks good in her room, i also bought the Jenny Lind crib. i did get the baskets from PBK to store stuff neatly on the shelves. The only complaint that i have is that the shelves are basically hard cardboard, but dont let that discourage you b/c they really are sturdy and as i mentioned i've got baskets on the shelves so you really dont notice.
We have four of these covers- one blue, two green, and a yellow.  They definitely make the changing pad a more comfortable surface for our baby- he loves just hanging out on them.  We leave a lap pad on the cover which is the first line of defense against accidents during changes.  This somewhat reduces the frequency of cover washings.  Some people have noted that they find these covers unnecessary- I'm sure the changing pad would be adequate by itself, but I just feel like the whole area is cleaner when I can throw the cover and pad into the laundry.Be advised that all our covers did shrink slightly after washing.  They do, however, continue to fit well on the pad.  The colors also faded slightly with washings.
This item is serviceable and probably something you could buy to use to basically get ruined without stressing about it.  The Wendy Bellisimo changing pad covers are only $2 more and much better quality fabric.  The terry used for these is very cheap and scratchy, like an old towel.  I am using them but am not fussed on how long they last or what happens to them, I won't be buying any more though.  Carter's also makes lap pads that are great for use over the changing pad.  You don't strictly speaking need a cover, it's easier if you don't use one.  I never used covers with DD and never had a problem.
These drop-ins are okay - they are not an improvement over an ordinary bottle. Yes, I can simply throw these liners away after using them, but since I still have to wash the bottle's nipple, this system does not save me any time. I use these liners in conjunction with my bottle warmer and they don't melt, which is good. I bought the Playtex Drop-In system to try to reduce the amount (frequency and quantity) that my baby spits up. However, the amount of spit-up is the same - not better, but also not worse.
I have some Dr. B brand bottles. They are awesome. But when I was a first time mom, I hated washing bottles and parts. It didn't take much time, but still it took time. So I switched to Playtex Drop-Ins bottles. Yay! I rinsed tons of nipples and washed them all at once later on the day. Now I have my 2nd child. Playtex Drop-ins is the only one I use.The liners are expendable. It designed for the bottle. It's durable and doesn't have plastic smell like other generic brand I used once.Please note: If you want to use generic brand liners, you fill water to the water lines ON THE LINER instead of the marks on the bottle itself. The water level/volumn is different.
These are so easy. I don't have to wash a million bottles anymore! I just have to wash the nipples. The only complaint I have is that I pre-fill with water and dump in the formula when I'm ready, but when I put in the 8 oz. and let the bottle sit for a while, the bag expands a little so it only looks like I have 7 oz. So the measurements may be a little off. I would use a measuring cup to make sure you get exactly how much water you want and not rely on the liner's measurements.
We have twins so when purchasing products, it was all about investing money in things that would make our lives simpler.  These Drop-Ins work really well for the bottles. The bag collapses as they consume the contents, which supposedly improves problems with gas but I'm not sure this system accomplishes it better than any others. Because the bag is thin, it also takes a lot less time to warm bottles if that is a consideration. The real savings is the manpower and time necessary for cleaning. I only have 4 bottles per baby, replace the liner and nipple when necessary, and wash everything once a day.  These don't come cheap so I don't think there is any cost savings associated with this versus buying a boat load of bottles.
Couldn't find this in stores around my area. But I've used this before and they're great. It's convenient and it minimizes the need for a lot of bottles and best part is they're disposables. I never had problems with this drop-in liners before although I did read another review that there's another liner that can be used with the drop-in nurser bottles, just as good if not more effective, cheaper and more count. Regardless, this has my stamp of approval and I would recommend this for new parents.
I love the drop-ins system.  I used them for my first daughter when I went back to work and my family who watched her loved the convenience of them. I am using them again for my DCP for my second daughter. There is less washing needed during the day as the bottle doesn't get dirty.  I have never had an issue with these and was happy to find them on Amazon!P.S. There is also a system you can buy to pump directly into the bottles.  It was cheap and saves a step!
I love these liners. They are a quick and easy way to ensure a sterile container for my milk. I have never had a problem with them leaking except for one time when I was squeezing the air out, squeezed a little too hard and POP!!, breastmilk everywhere. I learned my lesson- squeeze gently, if at all. My only complaints are: 1. They are a bit pricey for plastic bags but the convenience factor makes up for it, imho. 2. The amount markings on the bags are a bit hard to read and don't really line up with the markings on the nurser shells, so the only way I can tell how much my LO has taken is to pour out and measure the leftover milk. Otherwise, this is a great product!!
I tried Avent and Dr. Browns before switching to Playtex Drop Ins.  I liked all three but Playtex drop ins are so easy!  And, the way the nipple is, for my daughter, seems to be the most natural and closest to breastfeeding.  if you feel the nip, sounds weird!, it has a texture to it that other bottles don't.  most bottles nips are pretty "hard" unless you go latex...which scared me because I didn't want to find out the hard way that my baby had a latex allergy!  Anyway, the silicone nip on the playtex nursers is much softer and pliable so the baby can kind of pull on it as she wants to.  It's great!  I highly recommend.  Hopefully this review is not too strange :)
We've been using these and absolutely love them! So much easier to clean than other bottle systems. Can easily remove all air to improve gassiness and colic in little one. Just press in the liner from the bottom. We are currently supplementing with formula and only using 2oz per feeding in a 4 oz liner, and it is still easy to remove the air.With the ring and nipple loosely on the bottle we carefully press on the liner from the bottom until the liquid level nears the top of the liner. Then we tighten the lid and continue to press any remaining air out through the hole in the nipple (be careful when pushing up on the liner before tightening the lid as liquid can easily overflow). If your fingers are not long enough, we sometimes use the handles of some of our kitchen serving utensils to aid in removing the air.
We used the playtex drop in bottles for our daughter and I do not have one bad thing to say about them.  They made my life a lot easier by cutting down on the washing of bottles.  You just drop in the liner and throw it away after feeding and the only thing you have to wash is the nipple.  No taking apart the bottle and washing several parts.... Just quick and easy.  We used the Madela bottles at first but she was having a few problems (too much air) but we did not have any issues with these.  We order all of our baby stuff on autoship (including the liners) and the price is unbeatable.
We chose to use the Playtex Nurser Drop-Ins system because of convenience and sanitation. I'm so glad we did! We've been using the 4 ounce liners for 4.5 months now and we have never had one leak or break. They're very easy to use and reduce my time doing dishes. I've used the 8-10 ounce liners a few times as well with no issues. For those curious about measurements, it's very close to the measurement on the Medela bottles I pump into and Nuk bags. Sometimes after pouring milk into the liners they will expand just a tad more once the weight of the milk pushes the crinkles out, but it's not a large amount at all. I've used the 4 oz Up and Up Target brand liners as well, but when these are on sale at Babies R Us they are usually cheaper than buying the generic from Target.
I love the drop in system bc although you have to buy liners, it's easy, sanitary and really helps reduce air intake. My only issue is when I put the liner in and use the bottle to measure- it's slightly off so I have to pull the liner out and check the (example) 6oz mark and I am using the bottles that are made for expandable liners so something is off and I like to be as precise as possible... It's  not that big a deal but I wish the bottle lines and liner matched perfectly.
I measured 8 ounces in a measuring cup, then poured it in the liner, and it was a little below the 8 ounces mark on the liner. I tried it again with a different measuring cup and received the same result. You can not put the liner in the bottle first to fill it up, because the measurements on the bottle do not match up with the measurements on the liners, My husband always has a hard time filling up the liners because it is hard to hold it and add water since they expand. Also, the numbers on the liner are very hard to read.
I started the first month of motherhood washing and sterilizing bottles multiple times a day. Then I came upon these Playtex nursers with disposable liners, and now I only use a regular bottle if I have to.  Valuable time has been saved, now that I'm using these things instead!The only caution I have for others out there is to be very aware of the measurements. Because the liners can accommodate 8-10oz of fluid, don't trust the measurements on this. I noticed the difference when I poured 5oz of pre-measured milk that had been stored in a milk storage bag, and when it was in the Playtex bottle, the bottle indicated only 4oz of fluid.Aside from needing to be more conscious of the measurements, this bottle liner system has been a life changing discovery for my household.
When used with the slow flow nipple and the breast pump adapter kit this is the closest to breastfeeding as you can get.I bought the breast pump adapter kit and now i pump in these bags and never have to use a bottle holder at all.no more milk transfer from bottle to bottle, and no more air at all.  you can squeeze all the air out of these liners.take a look at the images to see step by step how i connect this to my pump kit and using the adapter rings and caps store, and feed without the need for the nurser bottle to mimic as close to mommy breastfeeding as possible.  For medical reasons my baby could not latch and this allowed me to bond with my daughter and have gas free feedings and be literally as close to breast as possible.  Check out the images - you will see for yourself this amazing way to nurse your baby.
I have been using those for months and will keep using them. They are convenient because it is easy to prep a per-sterilized bottle without having to worry about cleaning bottles. I usually rotate with 4 nipples so I always have at least one clean to put on the bottle and it is ready.The bags don't seem to collapse as the milk is drunk. This might be more an issue with the bottle itself than the drop-in.First few times I wasn't careful in positioning the drop in and ending up pouring the most of the milk on baby due to a bad leak. After doing that twice I was more careful in positioning the drop-in.Conclusion it is a great idea, time saver on cleaning.
I have used disposable drop-in liners from multiple stores (Wally-World, the bullseye store, & various drugstores) and find that they all work just as fine as these Playtex ones do, but at half the price.  I like that the Playtex liners are thinner feeling, meaning the liner collapses better inside the bottle when baby is drinking...but even with the others feeling like a thicker plastic, they work as well.  Playtex, come down in price and you'll get 5 stars instead of only 4.
These liners are a great idea in theory. I only use them because my baby like the latex nipples and not many other bottle brands have latex nipples anymore. The measurements are a nightmare, I have to guess how much breastmilk I am pouring in the bottle. The only thing that helps is that I pour it in from a lansinoh storage bag and that gives me a better idea of how much I am putting in.With regards to leaks and the liner lip pulling free and falling out, I only experienced that with the 4oz liners but that was because I was overfilling them. However I am always worried about this happening so I screw the nipple on very carefully. It would be great if the nipple ring was clear so you could see if the liner is on the verge of pulling free or not.
I used these with my first daughter 8 years ago. They are wonderful! You do not have to sit and wash bottles constantly. The baby will also have less gas since there is little to no air to contend with. The only difference with these are that they are expandable. This may make a difference for some using formula in respect to measuring differently with the expansion. I will be using them to store breast milk for when I go from breast to bottle as baby gets older so the expansion won't affect me any. I recommend these liners for everyone.
The playtex with drop-ins system works great. Makes cleaning super easy - since you don't need to sterilize the bottle every time you use it. The liner and the nipple are the only things that come in contact with milk - the liner is disposed off after one use, and the nipple can be easily sterilized.This system works particularly well when traveling. I introduced these to my son when he was 2.5 months old and we were on a flight for 16 hours. I simply took 2 nurser bottles, lots of liners, and many nipples. Made cleaning super easy on the flight - and gave me the piece of mind that everything was sterilized. The biggest advantage was that my luggage was a lot less bulky (as opposed to traveling with 8 glass bottles).The only downside: The 1 oz, 2 oz, 3 oz etc markings on the nurser are not correct. You should use another system of measurement to figure out how much milk/water you want to pour in the nurser.
The Playtex system works well with my Medela breast pump - you will need to buy these liners, plus a set ofPlaytex Drop-Ins System Breast Milk Storage KitPlaytex storage rings (which these liners drop into). That kit comes with an adapter that fits on a Medela pump. The whole system is convenient and easy to move from frozen storage to feeding simply by dropping these liners into a bottle, and you can buy either latex or silicone tips for your bottles. The thin plastic allows the milk to heat up easily by submerging in warm water before feeding. Overall, very convenient and in almost 7 months of pumping, I never had a leak! Also, BPA free which is great!
This product works directly with our Medela breastpump with the use of adapters that come with the breastpumping kit.  It is nice not to have to transfer the breast milk from one container to another.  I cannot comment on the freezing aspect since I did not make enough milk to be able to freeze.  The only downfall to the liners that we found is measuring out the quantity is not accurate if the liner isn't fully expanded.  We measure in a different container and pour into the liner.  The best part about this system is that we are sure that the container holding the milk is clean- we just don't trust a regular plastic bottle to come completely clean.  Our other bottles are the good old fashioned Evenflo glass bottles.  All in all, we recommend this product.
I love these and will be buying more.  I like that is made of tissue paper and nothing plastic.  They absorb pretty well--I admit that when my son decides to pee in the middle of a diaper change the sheet does get wet very fast, but 95% of the time it doesn't leak into my changing pad sheet. I usually throw away the wet peewee pad right away so it doesn't have time to leak anyway. These really are a lifesaver and save me from excess washing of the changing pad cover. I only wish that Amazon sold the 108 ct instead of just the 36 ct pack.
Very handy item to have available. Heats faster than boiling and more efficiently/safely than the microwave.  The only problem I've found is that the heating instructions included with the warmer are overestimated. If you set it to a lower temperature (between 1 and 2) and let it warm longer, it's easier to prevent overheating.This warmer DOES HAVE an ON/OFF SWITCH, but still no built-in timer (the oven timer works just fine).And as far as the bottle floating around during heating, you can put the bottle in BEFORE you add the water, and fill up the water to the same level as the liquid in the bottle to prevent uneven bobbing.My son is now 1-year-old and no longer uses bottles, but I still use this warmer for his refrigerated baby food and even to warm up a cup of milk for him.
I couldn't breasfeed my daughter so she have been a formula fed since she was born... So, for me this was a most have because I have to warm up my daughter's formula all the time. The problem with this warmer is that you can't let it finish, because if you do it the formula will be normally TOO HOT!!...The solution: If you buy concentrate formula, just warm here the concentrate formula and after it's hot you could add the water...In this way is going to have the perfect temperature for your baby to eat...But if you use powder or ready to use you have to count the minutes and take out the bottle before it's done.
This warmer costs more than it's worth.  We have to stand there while it's &quot;warming&quot; a bottle until the light turns off and then when we check the bottle it's still cold.  Having to stand hawk eyed over a bottle warmer with a crying, hungry baby isn't fun...especially when it doesn't warm the first time around.  On the other hand, if the bottle stays in a minute too long, the milk gets so hot that we have to set it in cold water.  There has to be something better out there!
I received this as a gift and was surprised at how quickly this warms bottles.  However, if you don't pay attention, it will overheat the bottle.  It would really be helpful if there was a timer or auto shut-off because the water can become scalding.  I usually use the wide-neck bottles so I don't have the "floating" problem but the few times I did use the slim regular bottles and did experience the floating bottle.  The upside is that it does accommodate the wide neck bottles.  It's also an easy-to-clean item.
I thought the idea of a bottle warmer was a rediculous waste of money before I had my daughter. I breastfeed, but have a hard time functioning in the middle of the night, so I pump during the day and warm a bottle for the baby in the middle of the night. For three weeks I boiled water in a pot and held the bottle with metal tongs...not ideal for someone half asleep. Once we coughed up the money for this warmer I was a much happier, half-asleep mom. It only takes about 8 minutes to heat a 5 oz. bottle. Since the heating elements are on the bottom of the product, I would suggest swirling the bottle and testing the temperature before giving it to the baby, better safe than sorry. Cleaning of the product is ultra-easy as well, vinegar, water and some soak time and it's good as new.
My mom got me this for a present because it used to be that you had to heat your bottles for formula.  Now you can feed the infants room temp, warmed, or cold.  I make the bottles as I feed so I feed room temp. and actually, this is what my baby likes most.  Sometimes I buy the ready to feed and store the bottles in the fridge so I warm them, but honestly, it takes a lot longer to do that than to just make the bottles.I think that this warmer actually takes longer to warm the bottles than to just put the bottle under hot water.  Just my opinion.
I like this bottle warmer.  It warms up the bottles quickly and that means alot at 3AM with a screaming, hungry baby.  I use the Dr. Brown's bottles with it and they fit fine.  I haven't had any problems with uneven heating or anything like that.  I have even taken the warmer with me when we go to friends houses so I can heat up the bottles quickly.  I strongly suggest that you do not put the nipples on the bottles while they are in the warmer.  It causes the formula to overflow from the nipple.  Found that out the hard way.  Other than that, I haven't had any problems or issues with the product. I would suggest this to parents looking for a small warmer.
It does it's job.  It does warm bottles quickly and the variable temperature is a great feature, but I, as well as everyone else I know who own one, have overflowed this model repeatedly.  Who needs another thing to clean up when you have a little one around?  There are warmers that have specific compartments for warming jars of baby food, this one doesn't work well for jars, but then again, my son doesn't really like his food warmed up.  It's an O.K. model to have.
I think the [...]. The fill line is crucial in getting the bottle warm. If you fill the water to high than it doesn't heat as well. The water is supposed to be just at the level of milk in order for it to heat correctly. If you fill it correctly it will work. It works fast too. A bottle of cold breast milk from the fridge is warm in about 4 minutes. If you're warming room temperature formula it will be even faster, probably about 2 minutes. I highly recommend this bottle warmer. My baby is not on solids so I can't say how it works on baby food.
I've had this warmer for 3.5 years, and have used it for both of my boys. It still works, after 3.5 years, as well as it did when I bought it. The only thing I don't like is that you have to add water almost everytime you use it, and that it doesn't have automatic shut-off. I have burnt much milk and formula in my life! (When you're chasing two kids, it's easy to forget you're cooking a bottle!) And, there have been times, too, that I've forgotten to unplug it for hours at a time... my fault, I know, but another reason auto-shut-off would be great.
My sister-in-law told us not to register for this because she couldn't get it to work.  Well, I wanted it and I registered for it anyway.  We got it and I decided to give it a try just to make sure it worked.  I used it the next time my friend came over with her newborn and it worked great.  Just add a little water, throw in the bottle, and in minutes it was perfect.  My only suggestions would be to add an on/off switch and a timer.  But other than that, it's another great product by Avent.
I first purchased another bottle warmer which I promptly returned because it did not work.  I received this bottle warmer as a gift from a friend who has three children, two of which are twins.  So, I figured she knew what was good and what was not.  And she was right, this works well.  I read some of the other reviews of this product but can only say I've had no problems with this.  It's easy to use and always warms the bottle just right...not too hot, not too cold.  I'm very pleased with this product.
I was told that you can warm up water in the microwave or just put it in a bowl full of hot boiling water. But, in the middle of the night after weeks of bad sleep, the last thing you want to do is exactly that!! With the avent express bottle warmer is the easiest way to warm up your bottles with less trouble. The only thing that I dont like of this product is that doesnt have an on/off switch. Otherwise, its great!!! ( avent products are the best out there...)
I got this product as a combo with the Avent Sterilizer.  ((Side note: the Sterilizer is a MUST HAVE item!!))It's nice to have a place to warm the bottle, and it does cut down on wasting water (vs the other method of a bowl of warm water).  The biggest plus is it's faster to prepare.  The problem that I had with the bowl of water method is that I would over heat the water then have to do a cool down process.  I thought this product would help with that but it doesn't.  You can get the water to almost boiling.  You have to time it, but again, it's fast and ready to go in 6-7 minutes.
I used this for a short time. It was more of a pain for us.I hated that you had to keep on top of it or you would never know how long it was in there. A timer would have been nice (and cheap enough to add).I hated how I had to unplug it and plug it in every time I wanted to use it.Yes, it may be the best there is out there, but that doesn't mean too much. It still has many flaws.Now I love Avent items but this one they dropped the ball on. There is so much they could have done with this that they didn't. Oh well.
This is a really great product... With just a little bit of water it sterilize everything really fast and it turn off by itself...And it's big enought to put almost everything you  want to... I really prefer this one instead of the microwave one because the other one is smaller, what means that you have to spend more electricity because you have to sterilize more times!!! And not even try to boil the bottles in the stove .... believe me, you would forget to turn it off... That has happend to me a thousand times in my mother's house!!
We started off sterilizing using the old-fashioned, boiling water in a pot...what a mess and waste of time! Standing over the boiling pot and risking steam burns ran out of fun very quickly. After I got over the sticker shock for the sterilizer and got it home, I couldn't see how we survived before! It's quick, easy and efficient. New moms have enough to mess with, don't spend you few, precious moments each day waiting for a pot of water to boil, splurge on this item and you won't regret it!!
This one is easy.  Put your stuff in, add a little water then push a button.  Truely a no brainer.  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is that you do have to drain it after each use.  My freind didn't and something started growing in it.  Other than that, this is perfect.  If you take out the racks you can fit a ton in it at once.  You don't have to watch over anything-go ahead and take care of your baby while this one does all the work for you.  Put this time saver on you registry.
This sterilizer is GREAT!  My girlfriend boiled her bottles and I can't believe how much easier (and safer) this is!  This only takes minutes and no risk of steam burns!I also sterilized the Avent breast pump and all of its parts in this sterilizer.  It worked great!Another plus:  the two racks with the tiny holes (not the one that the bottles rest on) can be snapped together to form a "basket" if you wanted to throw stuff into your dishwasher.  I've never done that...I'd rather sterilize the bottles and nipples and stuff using the steam from the water and not use detergents from a dishwasher...my baby's not even a month old yet...maybe after he's older, I'll use that feature as well.  For now, this sterilizer is EXCELLENT!  Definitely worth the money!  We're very pleased with it.  We also have the Avent food warmer...another great buy!
We have a dishwasher and had a full term very healthy child, and still used this product. Lids and nipples tend to turn up in the dishwasher and retain water, and sediment..so what is point if I have to just rewash them?This sterilizer holds 6 bottles, nipples, tops, and pacifiers all at the same time. You can put breast pump parts in it, and anything else that you need to sterilize. I washed everything, filled this with the items and water, and popped it in at 6 minutes in our microwave to have perfectly clean and sterilized bottles, pacifiers, or breast pump parts. I used this everyday until my son was 6 months old, when we stopped sterilizing bottles. Its easy, safe, convenient, and fast.
I thought this would be a great way to get my bottles clean but you still have to scrub them clean first yourself, THEN prepare this thing to stick in the microwave for x-amt of time, THEN wait for it to cool.... too much to do prior to getting a bottle ready for a fussy baby!&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;If your baby has an immune promblem, then this may be great for you, otherwise, skip on this and just buy a nice bottle brush.... I like the one by Munchkin.&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;BUT if you still decide to get this, check it in the store first, because when I got mine home it was USED- it had obvisiously been returned (someone else thought it was useless too I guess) with milk residue on the bottles- yuck!
Despite the concerns about BPA we are using these bottles for our daughter, and using canned formula to supplement breastfeeding. The concern with BPA seems to be heightened when the bottles are washed with hot water, or sterilized at hot temperatures. We bought this sterilizer, but have stopped using it. However, we still use the dishwasher, which is fairly hot. I am keeping an eye on Avent's statements:[...]We keep using them because they seem to be really excellent bottles and nipples, she feeds easily and doesn't get a whole lot of gas. The nipples are designed so that you can graduate her to faster flow nipples as she gets bigger. We are hoping that the BPA concerns will turn out to be unwarranted.
I bought this a few months ago and after reading a little about it, I thought that I wouldn't use it.  Boy, was I wrong.  I use it for all sorts of things.My niece dropped a sippy cup of juice in my car that wasn't discovered for a week.  I washed the cup.  When I removed the valve...NASTY.  I don't think it's ever been taken apart and washed.  After a second washing, I put all of the parts in this and let the microwave work it's magic.I love the lift out tray because whatever's in there that I'm sterilizing isn't sitting in the water.  It can also hold the Avent Isis breast pump.  The sterilizer is actually a great place to store your pump when it's just been cleaned and not in use.
I ama clean freak and ws parnoid from day one about germs and my first child. I live in an area with hard water and boiling things was not reassuring because the water left deposits on our nonstick cookware. I would wash her bottles and things , pop them in here and in the time it took me to finish cleaning the kitchen or toss some clothes in the dryer this would be done. I could leave the bottles in there or take them out and prepare for use while sterilizing pacifiers and other items. I use the Avent system and love this!Now that she is about 7 months I only sterilize once a week but this s so simple I do not regret my choice. Being a nurse I worried about my daughter catching something....this was just reassuring.Great as a gift....
I am one of those without a dishwasher, unfortunately.  I use this sterilizer a few times a day for my baby's bottles and parts.  I don't use Avent bottles - works fine with other bottles.  I have to agree about making sure it's shut/snapped properly.  You have to make sure it's just right before you snap -- otherwise, you will break a nail or two.  Also exercise caution when taking it out of the microwave.  I always use an oven mitt to take it out and when opening the lid to avoid steam burns.
It doesn't get any easier than this product.  Boy, am I glad that I got this at my shower.  I have never used anything more in my entire life than I have this guy.  It sterilizes my Avent breast pump as well.  As an aside, don't just rely on your dishwasher to sterilize your bottles and your breast pump.  For some reason, I never felt comfortable anyway just depending on it and put the bottles from the dishwasher into this sterilizer.  Well, I found out later that it was a great thing I was doing that because our dishwasher was not heating the water the way it was supposed to and nothing had been sterilized!  You can't always depend on one thing to do the job and since it's your baby's health involved here, take the extra step and make sure with this item.  I'm glad I did!  Plus, it's just so very easy to use.
I had an electric steraliser (which died) before buying this one.  I wish I had had this steraliser all along.  It's so easy to load up, everything fits snuggly and has it's place (I had trouble with bottles falling over in my electric steraliser), and extremely easy to wash and keep clean (the electric steraliser was a pain to clean - especially the element).As we use Avent bottles - 4 fit perfectly and are steralised in 8 minutes (our microwave isn't very powerful).  From the instructions it looks like other bottles fit easily as well.I use this daily and haven't had a problem with it - easy to use, easy to secure the lid and I use it for my bottles and dummies.Recommended if you are using bottles and especially the Avent brand.
This sterilizer is absolutely wonderful, especially if you take your baby on the road, i.e. to the grandparents' house.  If they've got a microwave, then you're ready to go.It's also very durable.  Ours gets lots of use every day and yet looks like it just came out of the box brand new.  Plus, unlike a bottle warmer appliance, there are no moving part or electrical components to wear out or break, so we expect we'll be using ours for years/babies to come.
This is such a great item and I can't say enough good things about it!  I use it several times a day for pacifiers, baby bottles, and breast pump bottles.  It couldn't be easier than popping things in the microwave for 5 minutes and knowing that your baby is getting sterilized items.A word of advice- be careful about removing it from the microwave.  The water inside and the steam can scald if you are not cautious.  Let it sit for a few minutes before opening, because the water can splash when opening the lid.
The express steam sterilizer is really the easiest and most efficient way to go if you want to be assured that your baby's bottles are truly clean.  When I first started using bottles I would use the sterilizer between dishwasher uses.  But after repeated cleanings in the dishwasher, the ounce markings on the bottles started to fade away, and the plastic caps to cover the nipples started to change color.  From then on I've used the sterilizer exclusively. It is quick, easy and effective.  I have taken several extended trips with the baby, and it is so easy to travel with and store her clean bottles in. This is one of those products that may not be necessary to have, but I am so glad that I do!
I love this.  This is the most wonderful item I have gotten.  I clean the bottles and then load them into this.  4 to 5 minutes later, the bottles are all sterilized.  I love this.  Since I express milk and freeze it, it is reassuring knowing that the storage containers are sterile.  I also love it because you never know if you are washing the bottles and pacifiers and such with warm enough water (I am a first time mom).  With the sterilizers I just have that reassurance that everything is clean enough for my baby.  This is well worth the money.  It is so easy to use and comes with extra bottles.
This has been a lifesaver!!! It can sterilize 5 small bottles & nipples 5 minutes at a time!!! Just add the correct amount of water, pop it in the microwave, and go!!! It's saved me so much time and hassle... At first, I didn't think that I wanted to spend the money on a sterilizer when I thought I could boil them myself for free, but this has more than paid for itself in it's first 3 weeks of use... A definate must have for new moms!!!
We initially bought this sterilizer for use with our first child born in 2005. I loved it then, but I'm even more impressed with some updated details in the version we just bought for our second child. Before, putting on and removing the lid used to be a bit awkward. Now, easy-to-use latches have made doing both completely hassle-free. The inner steam tray also has more slots and spots that make arranging items easier. The older version was very similar but did not have specialized "compartments" to such an extent. All in all, it remains an extremely easy product to use because if I had to sit there sterilizing by boiling water and whatnot, it surely would not get done. That the sterilizer comes with bottles is pure bonus. I'd buy the steamer alone.
I bought this sterilizer when I was using Avent bottles and it worked great.  There is a place for everything...bottles, nipples, and caps.  Our microwave is 1200 watts, so using this sterilizer saved me a ton of time...bottles were done in 3 minutes!  However, when I had to switch to Dr. Brown's bottles, I was in for a shock.  Apparently the Dr. Brown's bottles are just slightly taller than the Avent bottles, so they would not fit in this sterilizer standing up.  I had to lay them down and pile everything on top of them.  Its a shame because this is a great product, but I can't recommend it to people unless they know for sure they can use Avent bottles only.
This is a great product and I highly recommend it.  The best sterilizing option since I don't have enough dishes to bother using the dishwasher more than once every two days.  Even if you just want to clean one pacifier, it uses less water and energy than boiling on the stove and it's quicker too.  It saves my skin from hand washing in scorching hot water  (but I still give things a quick rince in warm soapy water before tossing them in the sterilizer).  It is a lifesaver when pumping and bottle feeding.The only drawback is the space that it takes up - it is about 12 inches in diameter and 6 inhes tall.  But I use mine so much, I just keep it in the microwave when I'm not using it!
What more can you ask for? This is one of those baby products! It's VERY easy to use: so easy to use, you will learn to use it (believe me, this is important) &quot;in your sleep&quot;. It is inexpensive too: just shop around for other sterilizers and you will see this is the best one you can get for this price. Finally, and perhaps most important of all: this is an essential piece of baby gear. Sure, you can boil those bottles and those pacifiers, but let's face it: this is the 21st Century, and you might as well make use of your microwave.
This is great!  I used to boil water to have my first child's bottles sterilized.  Then I got this for my 2nd and 3rd children.  I read the other reviews that it's much easier to just pop it in the dishwasher.  But what about for some of us who don't run their dishwashers daily(maybe because it's not a full load yet).  This sterilizer only takes 7 oz. of water and it takes 4 minutes in the microwave and your bottles, nipples, pacifiers, breast pump, etc. are sterilized.  You can't beat 7 ounces of water and 4 minutes of time.  You can't always wait for the dishwasher, which can take 30 minutes of more, plus all the water being used.  So for me, I think this sterilizer is great and it is very convenient.
I highly recommend this product whether you are breast or bottle feeding (or sippie cup for that matter). I did not originally register for this item because I didn't think it was necessary, especially since we have a dishwasher. This is a great tool to get all those baby/toddler items germ free. I mainly use mine for sterilizing my breast pump supplies, bottles, and pacifiers. 4 minutes in the microwave and its done. Its not necessary to sterilize all baby products but when something really needs to be, it sure beats having to run the dishwasher. There are just the 3 of us so we only need to run the dishwasher about twice a week. I find that I sterilize more often just because it is so easy to use this product.
Yet another great product from Avent!  This is so very easy to use and in minutes you have sterilized bottles, pacifiers, toys, pretty much anything that you can fit into the the thing.  We have a dishwasher, but our doctor advised that newborns can be sensitive to the soap the first few months.  Plus with animals in the house, we just like the idea of a little extra peace of mind.  By the way, we started with the electric sterilizer but after reading the directions and seeing it's size we returned it for this one.  This one is easier to store and use and is faster.
My almost 4 month old son is VERY small (24th percentile!) so the doctor recomended me buying a sterelizer, in other cases careful scrubing and just putting the bottles in the dishwasher would do, and it can save you some trouble. but for those people who need or really want a sterelizer, this ones great. Its much less expensive than the other sterelizers that take over all your counter space! It cleans my bottles very well, and I use mostly avent by the way. It can also sterelize my 2 1/2 year olds "magic cups" after he gets over a virus or if he had milk (another product by avent). It is fairly simple to use and much less stressful than boiling water, in my opinion. It also comes with 4 bottles, although my house is a bottle factory as it is! This sterelizer can also be used as a drying rack if needed. I love this sterelizer and it has kept my small son very healthy, happy and playful!
I bought this one as well as the full size counter version. This one was really helpful with pacifiers and nipples. I had a harder time with bottles just cause not many fit in it. But I found that bottles in the dishwasher and nipples and pacis in the microwave steamer were much better. In the dishwasher the nipples sometimes come out with the white dish det. film on it, of course in the sterilizer..not..BUT please don't worry about being burned. Common sense tells you what to touch or not touch and honestly if you do it once...you won't do it again.. Overall better for the money then the bigger one from Avent.
I have to pump milk for my daughter at my office, and getting my pump parts clean was challenging.  Our sink doesn't put out enough got water for me to feel that my parts were really clean and safe.  Now, I wash the parts and then put them through a steam sterilization in the office microwave, and I pump with the confidence that I'm not adding harmful bacteria to my breastmilk.  It also serves as a nice place to store my pump parts at the office, where I know they will remain clean and untouched.
This product is easy to use, works well and is FAST . . . and everyone knows that time is precious is a new baby.  I use Advent bottles & pacifiers and they fit perfect as do all the parts to my Medela breast pump.  I don't use the sterilizer every time anymore since my daughter is a little older now.  I run the bottles & pacifiers though the dishwasher so I feel comfortable with the heat they get from that.  This sterilizer is great though as it is very light weight and easy to store in between uses.  It's up to you & your doctor whether you need a sterilizer, but if you do decide to get one, definitely get this one.
When we bought this, I thought of it as a luxury item, because you don't really need to sterilize that much, but we never use the dishwasher and I thought it would be easier and safer than boiling water.  Turns out that we were diagnosed with thrush and had to sterilize many times a day.  So glad to have had this!!! Some have complained about the "condensation" but this is really just the very fine mist of the boiled water on the items.  Shows it's working.. just rinse it off with water and put the items in the drying rack.
I love this sterilizer. I am a breastfeeding mother and use the Avent Isis to pump milk from time to time. This sterilizer fits the Isis perfectly along with a few bottles, nipples and sealing discs. I wash my bottles out after I use them and put them away. When I'm ready to pump, I load this up and 7 minutes later I'm good to go. You don't need to dry the bottles or pump before using, if you use them right away. When I'm done, I wash my pump and store it back in here to dry. It stays there until I'm ready to use it again. I've never tried sterilizing any other bottles but the instructions specify how to place others in here so they fit well. It is very time saving, rinses easily, and works very well. I'm glad I've never had to resort to the boiled water on the stove.
I was told that I could wash our baby bottles in our dishwasher and I would not need a sterilizer.  BUT we live in post housing on an Army base and our dishwasher is awful and hardly gets anything clean.  So I handwash all my bottles and bought this as an extra step to help me get them clean enough for my child.I really like this product a lot.  It is very easy to use and since I am using Avent products and an Avent manual pump, everything fits great in this sterilizer.  I can even pop pacifiers in there when they fall on the floor.  There are slots for basically everything and it all stays put when I am moving it around.I know that it isn't really necessary, but I like using it for that extra peace of mind that my baby is getting CLEAN bottles.  Every parent has different 'must haves' when they have babies and this is one of mine! :)
On more than one occassion I've had a crying hungry baby on my hands in teh middle of the night or the very early morning, and walked into the kitchen only to find that all of the bottles are in teh sink or in the dishwasher yet to be run.  It's much easier to keep my daughter distracted four the 4 or 5 minutes I need to wash and sterelize in this product than to wait for a load of dishes to run!  If this sounds like somthing that could happen to you . . . buy this product! (Or put it on your registry).
I love this sterilizer and AVENT products in a whole! I bought a sterilizer because I don't use the dishwasher at all, and well I just didn't trust it to 'sterilize' my baby's bottles well (especially the nipples!).  Well I must say that I'm very happy that I got this product.  It is VERY easy to store and does the job well. Avent bottles fit perfectly in it (as I'm sure you already guessed), but it also fits all other bottles!  I use it to sterilize my bottles, nipples, caps, pacifiers, teethers and breast pump parts.  I generally sterilize the bottles once a week, but if needed, I can take it out and sterilize her teethers, etc anytime.
We don't have a dishwasher so I throw everything in the sterilizer (bottles, breastpump parts, binkies, etc.)after washing with soap and water. It is easy to use, just throw items in, 7 ounces of water and microwave for 7 minutes. I use this sterilizer daily.I only gave it four stars because I put in the breast shield from my First Years breast pump and it melted a bit where the shield sat in the appropriate slot. I can still use the breast shield but there is a permanent dent melted into it. Otherwise, I love this sterilizer!
This was the perfect solution for my pump parts and bottles. I read everywhere that you do not need to buy a sterilizer if you have a dishwasher, but I don't run my dishwasher fast enough to have my parts and bottles ready for each feeding/pump.  This fits all of my pump parts and 2-3 bottles and nipples.  It's ready in 4 minutes, which is way faster than dealing with the dishwasher.  You do need to prewash in soapy water, but I don't worry about scrubbing.  Overall, it does the job in a very short amount of time!
5 reasons to have the avent express micro sterilizer:- Reasonable price!!- It comes with an extra value of 4 avent bottles ( it says here that comes with two, but I just got mine and comes with 4!!)- Its great for travel,not too big, not too small.- Very very very easy to clean- It does the job in 4 minutes!you can keep it anywhere because of its convinient size ( and its made of plastic!)* I used to have an electric sterilizer and as soon as I heard about this one, I got it  and life with a baby it just  became simpler than ever!!!
I saw this and just had to get it. It's good to wash and sterilize all bottles and breast pump parts before using them the first time.I own the Avent Isis breastpump and this has grooves for it to click into-very cool! I like to sterilize my pump once or twice a week, and once a week I sterilize the bottles and nipples.I can't ever wait for the washer to run, so instead of waiting, I just throw everything I want sterilized into the microwave for 4 minutes and it's done. It's so easy and simple.And it keeps things sterile for 3 hours unless you pop open the top right away!
For weeks I boiled my ISIS pump parts and bottles, leaving on my non-stick pot calcium stain. As I was going back to work and my baby had to be bottle fed (thus more things to be sterilized), I found this great product and eagerly bought it. It's such a great invention! Everything (pump parts, nipples, dome caps, bottles etc) has slot of its own on the rack so they won't shift around. And if you keep the lid closed after sterilizing, contents stay sterilized for a day!Be sure to check your microwave power though, since it takes 4 minutes for a 1100watts microwave, longer for less powerful ones. Even though I have a 1350watts one, I do it for 4 minutes just to be sure!  And let it cool for recommended length of time to avoid scorching yourself.Enjoy this product and you won't regret.
I have used the Avent "II" sterilizer found at other retailers.  (probably not much difference between the two)  I have been using the sterilizer for one month since having my twins.  It has really been helpful cleaning non-Avent items (breast pump items, baby bottles, pacifiers, etc.)  It can sterilize in 2 minutes (depending on the power of your microwave).  You don't HAVE to have this sterilizer, but, it helps if you want to clean a few items without having to boil water each time or running your dishwasher.It came with two small Avent bottles.  I'm not reviewing the bottles themselves - that's another topic.  However, this is a nice feature so you can try these bottles out to determine if you want to use their bottles or not.
I was using a basket to hold wipes, lotions, etc and keeping on the changing table.  My daughter is growing and is very long so the basket was in the way.  I looked everywhere for a hanging basket but couldn't find one I liked for a decent price.  This diaper  depot is absolutely perfect.  It hangs perfectly on my changing table.  I did put a piece of fabric under it so the finish doesn't get scratched on the changing table.  I love having everything right there at changing/dressing time without taking up drawer space.
We received the Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot for ease of access to diapers. It attaches perfectly to the Gulliver Changing Table we have from IKEA which made me really happy. Accessing newborn diapers is a bit difficult since the diapers are much smaller than those used for older babies but that's fine since we won't be using newborn diapers for long. I'm curious to see how it will work with the cloth diaper inserts since we're planning on cloth diapering when our baby is out of the newborn stage. We haven't received our cloth diapers so I have yet to see. I'll post an update when I get them.I do wish it had a little larger storage for diapering supplies. With the wipers warmer in the caddy, it's difficult to see the supplies on the back side and I can only hold a pump bottle of hand sanitizer or a couple of tubes of diaper cream. Other than that, it's a handy product.
I have recently started having a problem with my 12 month old kicking everything off of the end of his changing table while I am changing his diaper. His changing table is a dresser than came with a wooden surround that is removable once you are out of the diaper changing stage. This easily slid onto the rail and remedied the problem we had with him kicking the diaper changing supplies to the floor.I like that the little side compartments are removable. DIsposable diapers are so thin now that the slot you pull the diapers out through could be a bit thinner. I do often have two diapers come out instead of one. Even with that issue, this product is well worth the eleven bucks I paid for it.
I was worried this wouldn't work for us. We have a Pottery Barn Kids changing table that has a decorative moulding that sticks out about 3/4 inch beyond the frame of the changer top. This product hangs at a slight angle because of this, but it still hooks on solidly to the changer's top edge, and gives us much needed storage space for wipes up top. It is an inexpensive fix to a very annoying problem. Another bonus is that the plastic piece that the wipes container rests on is hinged to allow easy access below for loading diapers or whatever you choose to store in there.
We have had this product for 2 years now and it works great! We hang it off the side of the changing table and it keeps everything handy. The plastic is thick and it is very well constructed. The only issue we have with it was keeping the box of wipes from moving about in the space for the wipes. We just use the plastic flip top box the wipes come in and it isn't a wipe warmer so it is smaller. We couldn't take a wipe out of the dispenser using one hand without either lifting the lid off the box or lifting the enitre box. To solve the problem, we just bought industrial strengh velcro and attached it to the bottom of the box and the "lid" of the diaper depot. Great product after this minor adjustment!
i do like this product but i dont think it was worth 15 dollars. if it was under 10 bucks i may have given it 5 stars. it seems a bit cheaply made. however, it does hang on the side of my changing table nicely and keeps all the little items together. i have a regular wipe container sitting on the top and it fits well. the smaller sized diapers dont fit too well because they just slide around in the little compartment and often more than one diaper pops out when you just need one, but i suppose it was made this way so you can use larger diapers as your baby gets older.
I bought this product to use on my Pack 'N Play.  It's definitely a nicer way to keep diapers and wipes organized at my Pack 'N Play changing table.  It fits onto the side of the Pack 'N Play nicely.  I wish the tub for the wipes box on top was deeper though.  The wipes box always tends to want to fall off when I'm taking a wipe out.  I also wish it held more diapers and that the diaper slot wasn't so wide, because when I pull out a diaper, about 2 or 3 want  to come out at once.  But all in all, this has been a nice item to have at my Pack 'N Play for diaper changing!
My son is huge and long for his age.  At 8 months he was way too long for the changing pad and his feet were kicking off the products and wipes at his feet.I ordered this product and it got everything off the changing table so he fits now with leg room to kick away without hitting anything.  Wipes are right there and we put a kleenex box in the diaper dispenser (the diaper dispenser isn't great--I'm not sure how it works w/o you grabbing more than one at a time.  We put the diapers on the shelf right under the table and put products and stuff in the lion heart thing.A MUST HAVE!!  I love this product.
I borrowed this item from a friend when I had my first child.  I loved it!  It stores a stack of diapers, a case of wipes, diaper cream, lotion, etc.- all within reach.  What I liked best was when friends and family came over to help out with the baby, they could clearly see where everything was to change baby's diaper.  Also, the plastic is clear, unlike a fabric diaper stacker, so you can clearly so how many diapers you have handy.Loved this item, will probably buy it for myself now that I'm pregnant once again!
I purchased this for use on our play yard where our son slept when he first came home. When I received it the size was appropriate, and I was able to attach it to the side of our play yard. However, I was very disappointed in the quality. The plastic it was constructed of was thinner than I hoped and that made the unit somewhat flimsy in my opinion and certainly not as sturdy as I had hoped. When I filled it with supplies, it looked as if it might break. I ended up returning it.
This model is such a space saver for my small changing table. It's very strong and easy to hook on the sides of the table (make sure that the edge of your changing table is not too wide though and be aware when you want to put  any wipe warmer on the top tray. Most of them don't fit inside the tray. It just fits regular wipe boxes.  And the side containers also don't fit very large bottle of baby powder or lotion). I still highly recommend it though.
I love this product!!!  It is one of the few things that I knew I wanted with my second child that I didn't have with the first, and I have not been disappointed.  I use mine on my changing table and it keeps everything so handy in one place.  It is always neat and together, and I never have to look around for what I need.  My son is still in size 1 diapers so I do find that when I pull a diaper out another one might fall out.  This is a minor inconvenience for the organization that it provides.  The last thing you want in the middle of a diaper change is to be disorganized!
We were originally keeping the diapers and wipes on the shelf of the changing table, probably because we didn't think there was a better option. I am so glad we found this, it works and fits perfectly for our changing table.The only issue we have now is that the wipes are accessible by the child being changed, and sometimes she likes to sit up and try to grab the pack. But if this wasn't there, I'm sure she would just find something else to do that is just as inconvenient.
This is a great item to have on the side of your changing table.  I have both a diaper stacker and this.  The diaper stacker is great for a decorative accent and storage of tons of diapers.  The diaper depot is great for holding those diapers handy for the middle of the night changing.  Also, the wipes warmer fits right on top in the perfect reach.  The side compartment, they can come off, hold all the perfect necessities like Desitin and baby lotion.  I held Alcohol pads in them for the umbilical cord for the first two weeks.  This is really a handy little organizational item.  It is clear so it doesn't really stand out.  I have two.  One upstair in the nursery and one downstairs in the play room.  I highly recommend it.
I have this on the side of our Jenny Lind dressing table.  I fit two rows of stacked newborn pampers swaddlers diapers in it (with the fold facing out), and they dispense just fine.  There is plenty of room to fit everything I need to use at the changing table in the side pockets... and I use the Dex Wipe Warmer with changing light in the area of the wipe holder.  It is a little bigger than the space alloted, but I find that the rubber non-skid bumps on the bottom of the warmer hold it within the wipes space... and since it is raised above the depot's wipes space it leaves room for any extra wipes that didn't fit inside the warmer.  This was a great buy, and I don't know what I would have done without it.  Everything is at a hands reach when I am changing my daugher (6 weeks old now) and I literally can hold her with one hand and reach everything with the other because of this.
I actually used this with my Pack N Play and loved the handy organizer features.  I moved it to my changing table after discovering I could order one of those Pack N Play Parent Organizers as a replacement part (even from another company's product!) which worked much nicer with my play yard.  Still - this item was very handy.  Note: it only fits on the "front" of a changing table or play yard (the attachment arm/hook is not wide enough to hang from the sides).Update at 1 yr: still using this item.  A good buy & fit on the pack-n-play but also on the changing table late on.
I received this as a gift and I'm going to buy it for every expectant mother I know.  We attached this right to the side of the changing table that came with our pack and play and it holds everything you could possibly need while changing your baby.  We hated the thought of having diapers and supplies just laying around downstairs, but were not about to run upstairs to the nursery every time we needed to change the baby.  This solved the problem...everything is right at our fingertips for diaper changes.  It also keeps our dog from going after diapers!
This was a total piece of garbage.  Several things are wrong.1.  It doesnt fit every changing table.  When I attach it to mine, it tilts downward and is not level at all.  You need to have a bottom slat or base to support it under the top slat it will go onto.2.  The side compartments keep falling off because they dont attach they just fit over the edges.3.  The biggest complaint is that the wipe tray does not fit every wipe box or wipe warmer and we have the same brand name wipe warmer that made this product.4.  Consider that you will be taking away 5 inches of walk space around your changing table after you put this hunk of plastic onto it.If you have your changing table in a small area or corner of a room, this makes a difference.What a cheaply made piece of plastic.Pass this up and buy a wall shelf to go over the changing table instead.
This holds our wipe warmer and about 2 days' worth of diapers, so far so good.  However, the side containers really don't hold much.  We can fit diaper cream on one side, and our little man's brush and baby lotion on the other.  I keep hand sanitizer and lotion for me on the changing table between the pad and the edge of the table.  Wish it would hold a little more, but it's great to have the things it will hold within easy reach of our son while we're changing him.
it has enough room for about 15 diapers and a wipes container on the top.  The two side bins are removable (a little too easily if you ask me but no big deal) and we use them for small lotions, nail clippers, the nose aspirator, and a few other things.The large lotion bottle we have and the large &#34;tub&#34; of A+D ointment we use don't fit in this though so i have to keep those on the counter itself.This has a lip so you can hang it from the edge of the changing table but since we have rounded (sleigh style) edges, it doesn't fit there.  We ended up putting it on a drawer instead and it wroks just fine.  Only thing is that the drawer underneath the one we attached it to doesn't open (the diaper depot gets in the way since it's taller than the drawer).  No big deal.I would recommend this - it saves it space and keeps us organized.
For the price you can't beat this item. I bought and returned a couple of changing table hanging organizers. This one is what I settled on. It fits my badger basket changing table just fine. I was really looking for something small to keep wipes and ointments handy in. I like that I can also for my small prefolds (for cloth diapering) in where the diapers go. They don't fit perfect, but well enough that I'm happy! I paid less than $9 for this item so I really have no complaints. It serves its purpose!
Its great, it fits so many items, i fit like 15-18 size 1 diapers, wipes, bottle of cream, tube of diaper cream, lots of small staff (hair brush, cotton swabs, nail clippers, alcohol pads, etc.) it very easy to put it together, i never had a problems with it falling down or falling apart. Plastic is very thick and seems sturdy. Well  this huge plastic thing doesnt look very attractive, but it super useful and clear, so u dont see it right away in the room.
I was looking for a diaper organizer/caddy for my changing station. I have an Ikea baby changing station and I needed an organizer that would hang from it, because I can't velcro something through it. That is exactly why I bought this diaper depot and I love it! Do pay attention to how wide your changing station's side is, it needs to be equal to or less than ~1.25 inches; otherwise, this diaper depot won't fit.I am able to fit some diapers in the middle compartment, place my wipes on top, and keep a few handy things in the side compartments. This allows me to use the entire space of the changing pad for my baby. Otherwise, I'd use some of the space to keep my wipes and diaper on the pad while I'm changing my baby. As she's growing, I need to be able to use the entire space for her and diaper depot helps me do just that. Love it.
This diaper caddy is a wonderful addition to our baby room which has very little counter space to put stuff. It fits our munchkin diaper warmer but just barely and holds about 20 diapers in the storage below. When you do pull diapers out sometimes 2 or more come out. The side holders aren't locked in so if you try to pick up the entire diaper caddy just by holding the side pocket it will fall.If you're looking for more reviews of baby registry essentials, read the baby registry guide from AllMomsArePerfect.com. Good luck!
Most diaper caddies out there for your changing table take up valuable table space, so this really appealed to me since it "hangs" over the edge of the table. Mine came cracked, and I didn't have the patience to send it back and get another one, as my baby was due soon and I wanted one less thing to worry about. It looks nice and works well, gets the job done. The only thing I worry about is putting a full box of wipes in it, as I'm afraid it will completely break since it's already cracked. I don't know how it got cracked as the box it came in was in fine condition. Room for diapers, wipes, diaper cream, lotion & more. Would definitely recommend to all parents of newborns.
I love this diaper depot.  Prior to purchase, I thought it might be a little cheap, but it's the exact opposite.  It is well made with hard thick plastic.  It holds the diaper warmer on top and the side bins are great for nic-nacs like diaper cream, nail clippers, brush, etc.  It stores the diapers in the middle and has slots at the bottom where you can pull the diaper out from the left side or the middle of the depot.  It frees up so much space from the changing table and keeps everything organized and accessible.  We have a Graco Sarah changing table and it fits perfectly on the front.  This was one of the best baby items we bought along with the Prince Lionheart premium diaper warmer.
We use the diaper depot for our Pack and Play playard. It's not a perfect fit, but it works, and it sure beats running around to get diapers, wipes, etc. I gave the diaper depot 5 stars despite two things:1) The opening for the diaper stacker is a little big, so sometimes an extra diaper slides out. In Prince Lionheart's defense, this may be necessary to accomodate larger sized diapers.2) The side containers could have been a little deeper.Besides these minor nuiances, it's a great product.
My sister got me this for my shower and I love it. I also own the ultimate wipes warmer and it clicks right into the top of this. It holds quite a bit of diapers for size 1 and I'm sure as they get bigger it won't hold as many. I love having this because it's right on the end of the changing table, has everything I need in it and is a life saver. I wish it could hold more stuff as some of the bottles of baby junk I got are a bit big. Other than that I love this product and wouldn't do without it. Great price too!
There is one by this same company made specifically for dresser type changing tables. I have it and love it. It is almost a necessity. Holds wipe warmer, diapers, diaper creme, hair brush/comb, some q-tips, powder, small bottle of lotion...you get it. It holds the essentials, not everything you bought for baby. Both are great, but it depends on the type of changing table you have. Or if you choose to use the top of a dresser like I did, you'll love the "Dresser Depot".
Love it, and it is a must in our babies room, but the only drawback is that our wipe warmer (Lion Heart 2004 model) does not fit correctly. To fix this we just taped down the wipe warmer. I love that everything you need can be placed in the diaper depot and so easy to grab one handed of course.Note:We do not use the bottom basket under the wipe warmer as a diaper storage but instead as a cloth towel holder and it works great, especially if you have a boy and need alittle protection and/or clean up from showers! Also our diaper stacker holds more and adds decor to the nursery's theme
This is great!It fits perfectly and securely over the side of the changing table. I like that the side holders are removable, because I only ended up using one of them. I was leery about this, since it's plastic and only cost ~$12, but it is AWESOME! Also, I got it from Amazon two days earlier than it was estimated to arrive (bonus!!).It is a very solid plastic - it is not flimsy at all. It's easy to pull out the diapers one-handed (from the bottom slot of the holder). I recommend this MUCH more than a hanging cloth "diaper holder" - this organizer is SO much more useful! It also puts the wipes right there - easy to grab!Highly recommended!
After purchasing the depot, I found it does not work well on my changing table (dresser style with fold out top). I had to put it on the side and was not pleased to find out that it is not possible to use unless it is hung. More bad news... I purchased the Ultimate Wipes Warmer, which will not fit on top of the depot while it is hanging on the side of the changing table. Perhaps these products work fine with a typical changing table, but keep in mind they do not work with a folding top dresser type.
We bought a house that for all the other dumb stuff the sellers were asked to do after our inspection both personal and VA, they didn't have issue with the openings between the rails on the stairway. My older daughter could not just fit her head through but her whole body with no effort!  They are the typical late sixties rails and are metal. Before you scoff and say how you would just replace them with code wooden ones I implore you to look up the cost of a single family home in the DC Metro area of Potomac and you will likely gulp as you swallow your words!  So this netting is a much more viable and affordable option. Easy to install and very sturdy if you attach it properly. Once my girls are old enough I will get rid of the netting and gates and maybe even reclaim the living room as an adult room. Until then this item is a great purchase to keep children safe.
We got this bath for our newborn. Unfortunately we weren't able to use it until very recently when she turned 4 m.o. The issue is that the triangle stopper is very wide on newborn side and my girl was crying when we put her in this tub. Even now she prefers to lay her legs on top of the stopper, not around.So for the first 4 months we used the infant bath seat made by the same company that was absolutely great. And the stopper in this seat is much narrower and much more comfortable for a baby.
My son moved to this tub when he was about 5 months old and too big for his whale tub. I love that there's the option to let them recline or sit up straight. While my son is sitting up with no problems now and can catch himself (he's 7 months) I still recline him while I wash his hair so that I can avoid getting shampoo in his eyes. I have never used the drain feature as I just tip the tub over when I'm done. This is a great tub for babies too big for the sink but too small for the real tub! I highly recommend! I also recommend theOXO Tot Tub Kneeling Mat, Blue- it really saves your knees while you bathe your child.
This tub will support your itty bitty newborn but its just too large. I ended up using a small tub that sat on the sink which allowed me to wash my daughter in an upright position so I didnt have to bend over and get achy knees from the bathroom floor. I had read all the reviews it seemed as tho this was the tub I must have! But at my Babies R Us store they did not carry it so I ordered from another store for additional cost- I think I ended up spending close to $50 between the $30 tub, taxes and shipping costs when I couldve saved all that time and money and been so much better with a 14.95 tub...which she still can use now at 6 months. My advice is to buy a smaller tub that you can use in the sink- save your back and spare your knees now because you wont always have the luxury of bathing your child this way long.
I bought this when my son was too big for the sink at about 5 months. We used this for 6 months. I would hang it from the shower curtain rod with a plastic ziptie threaded through hole in the tub and then one of these "S" shaped rubberized hooks from the Container Store. After my son started walking and climbing, he just used it for leverage to climb out. I though that I would get more use out of this, but at 11 months it became unsafe since he was trying to climb out of the tub (not the tub's fault). So the eurobath was replaced with a rubber rub liner with suction cups and now he walks around the real tub.
We bought this tub after our son outgrew his standard baby tub because we were nervous about putting him in our deep jetted bathtub. It's been a great item and our son LOVES his baths more than ever. The way the tub is designed works out perfectly for our wiggly toddler - it "holds" him in place so that he doesn't slip under. The drain is my only complaint - we use this tub by placing it in our "adult" tub and the way the drain is situated we have to lift the Eurotub slightly to get it to drain (or place something under it to prop it up) -also: the drain cap should've been designed to open in the other direction so the natural water flow when draining wouldn't close the cap so easily. Two tiny prices to pay for a great tub - I would definitely recommend it and I would purchase it again.
We gave our baby his first bath in this when he was only 5 days old, and we're still loving it now that he's almost 5 months. It's growing well with him and he always seems secure so that we don't worry about him slipping around. It is a large tub (almost as long and wide as our standard bath), so I don't recommend it if you are looking for something easy to store. However, if you have a dedicated child's bathroom where you can keep it, then this is a great baby bath tub.
I use this tub along with the Safer Bather and absolutely love it.  While on vacation at a friends home I about lost my mind without this tub.  She had another baby tub and my daughter was sliding all over the place.  I have used the Eurobath with the Safer Bather from the start with my baby and she doesn't slide anywhere.  She is now 8 months old and loves to kick and play in the water.  I plan to buy this for my friend when she has her next child.  I think every parent needs a safe tub.
The infant side of this tub wasn't very comfortable for my newborn, she kept slipping and the middle portion that is supposed to keep the baby from slipping is a bit awkward with its triangular shape. It is also a HUGE tub. My mother didn't like it at all and she ended up getting us a very similar smaller version at walmart for 11 dollars, that was much more comfortable and actually fit in our sink. I'll give it another shot when my daughter is about 3 months old and will hopefully have grown into it.
After I read all the reviews here on Amazon, I bought this bathtub right before the baby was born.  I had received 3 different baby tubs as gifts and returned them all and I'm glad I did. The baby is now 6 weeks and I can say that it is a well designed tub.Pros: Works great for newborn and the baby can continue to grow into it. The baby feels safe in the built in cradle for smaller babies.Cons: Only downside is it is super big.  I have to use it in our kitchen or the master bathroom where we have a large enough counter top.  Make sure you have enough counter space to place the tub on.  I would not put this in a regular size tub, can't imagine bending over like that is good for anyone's back or knees.Overall:  I highly recommend this tub.  Baby is happy and safe.
I bought this tub after reviewing almost all the other comparable tubs on here! My son was 5 months old when I bought it, and he is now 14 months... it works great for us! He is just starting to outgrow the small side (and he is very long for his age), so we just switch him to the other side or put him in the big bathtub if we wish. I love that this tub is BPA free, and it cleans/dries very well. It is large, but has plenty of room for your child as he/she grows. One of my most useful buys!
My daughter is 3.5 years old and I have been looking for a large enough sturdy bathtub for her.This one is just perfect in every aspect.It is large and deep enough for a toddler and very comfortable and stylish.My daughter is thrilled with it and loves her bathtime in her new Primo Euro Bath.It is easy enough to empty out the water and it fits perfectly in a standard bathtub.Definately a good buy.I would not reccomend it to parents of a newborn or a small baby.This is more of a second baby bathtub.
I originally bought a Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad based on all the good reviews.  I did not have any luck with it, was very hard to bathe baby alone so I searched again and came across this one.  It is exactly what I needed.  I am able to bathe my little one without any help.  She was probably about 8 lbs when we started using this tub and it cradles her so nicely so I don't have to hold her up or worry about her slipping under the water.  She is able to kick her feet and feels cradled and secure up by her arms.  This is really an awesome design.  It is a really big tub though.  We store it in her bedroom after it dries because there is no room in our bathroom for it.  That is the only downside, but it doesn't take away from the product at all so I didn't lower the rating.  Would highly recommend this tub.
Primo claims that the &#34;Eurobath is the only bath tub you'll ever need&#34;. It might just be true!When our LO was born, we started with one of the smaller standard bathtub with a net. It was ok while we used the net but quickly became uncomfortable for our LO. Now that we've tried it, we wish we'd have gotten the Eurobath right from the start.PROS:- Fits in our standard bath tub- Can be hanged (we use a Command hook)- Keeps baby comfy and safe for months on the &#34;baby&#34; side (at 7 months old, 18 lbs and over 28&#34;, our LO still uses the &#34;baby side&#34;)- There seems to be lots of space on the other side for when we're ready for it- Empties fast and easily- Actually saves water because it's so wide that there's no water loss when filling from the tub spout- No mold issues- Baby loves it!CONS:Haven't found any yet.
We've been using this tub since our son was about 6 months old.  At first we used the infant position which worked great.  We got this when he was younger but since it doesn't have any padding we used instead a different tub until he was able to somewhat sit up (maybe he wouldn't have cared, but it looked painful).  After a year, he is still using it and fits perfectly in it. The tub went through a lot of banging, crayola drawing and stuff like that, but it looks great, and works like new.  The stopper has never leaked!
This tub is great. Very well designed and extremely well made.  My son is very big for his age and yet still fits in it really well.  It is very sturdy and yet is light to carry and as our bathroom is quite small is hung on the wall out of the way when not in use.  It fits well in the large family bathtub but also on the worktop next to the sink when my back is too sore to lean over the bath.  The small plug is very easy to use too and means you can drain a little water to top it up if you need to.  I love the fact that as he gets older he can sit up at the other end and I won't have to use so much water as the large family bathtub for him for quite some time. I haven't seen a better bath anywhere.
I had a different baby tub before this because I thought this was too expensive. But my baby outgrew the one first one I bought so I ended up buying this one and I wished I bought this one in the first place!The tub is large so it holds more water. My baby loves playing in it! The newborn side of the tub is awesome. It prevents my baby from sliding.The toddler side is great too! My son enjoys sitting up and playing with his floaty toys.Don't be intimidated by the size. I have a narrow tub and was worried it wouldn't fit in it, but it fit perfectly!
This bath tub is everything we wanted in a tub for our baby. It has ones side where she can lie down and the other side where she can sit up. We started using this when she was 5 months; she could not yet sit by herself. She is now 8 months and sits very well on her own. She'll use the sitting up side for part of her bath, but still very much enjoys lying down on the other side. I was hesitant when I bought it, but now that we've had it for a few months, I would definitely buy it again.
We absolutely love the EuroBath!  We use it in conjunction with the Safer Bather bath pillow and our 6 month old just loves bath time!  The tub is incredibly well constructed, with a convenient drain at the bottom.  Whether your new baby is lounging on the one side, or your older baby is sitting on the other side, it is a safe, secure and comfortable way to bathe your child.Do not be frightened away from this fantastic tub because of its size.  It is longer than many tubs, but you can use it for a very long time and it stores conveniently right inside your bathroom tub or closet.I HIGHLY recommend this product!
Our 4 month old son outgrew the First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub within a few months. He wanted to kick the water, but was kicking the plastic instead, which made him unhappy. I finally bought this bath. He tried it out yesterday and he was so happy! He fit in the tub very nicely. He could finally kick and splash in the water. In this bath he can splash the water with his hands too. He looked really crammed in the First Year's tub compared to this one. He stayed in the bath for 40 min splashing, laughing and cooing nonstop. No matter how much he moved, he stayed well secured.Great bath! Yes it is big, but that is the point!
This tub is VERY VERY large. It is too big to fit in my sink so I must put it on the countertop to bathe my 3 week old or be subject to putting it into my bathtub which is hard on my back. It also has very high sides so it is very difficult to reach into it to bathe him; even though I am 5' 8". I had a smaller tub for my daughter which fit very well in my sink (sure comfort deluxe) but I had lost the net which is required for a newborn so that's the only reason why I purchased this one (it got very good reviews). I am going to go back to the sure comfort deluxe tub once my son has better control over his movements. I am very suprised that this tub got such great reviews because of the size of it. My son is lost in it.
This is a BIG tub, but it works. We put it on the counter between our double sinks so it is easy to use. I bought it because you can use it for newborns as well as toddlers. For small newborns it is not as comfortable, they kind of slide around a bit. I wish there were some kind of gripper for them to lay on, we use a towel so he doesn't slide around as much. It is nice and deep, which is good for boys just in case they pee, it doesn't make it out of the tub. I get annoyed at the plug to drain the water, the pressure of the water flowing through it closes it, so you have to hold it open to drain the water.
We decided to go with this bath tub after reading lots of reviews about it...they were all positive!When we received it via courier, we were happy with the quality although found it a bit big.Our daughter is 5 weeks old and we've used it about 6 times or so.  Unfortunately we have to use it in the bath tub since it's so big which makes it difficult for us having to bend over all the time to wash her.  We don't have that much kitchen counter space so it won't work in that manner.All in all, our daughter enjoys it and seems quite secure in it.  She's not slipping around and she is well supported.PROS:-plastic seems durable, not flimsy-no foam/anti slip material in tub = less mildew, bacteria growth-has drain in tub-infant is well supportedCONS:-a little pricey-bigCompared to all the other tubs we saw, this one is a lot better in quality and function.  I would definitely recommend this to my friends!
This is an excellent tub. I tried one of the seats first, which pinched my baby and was really uncomfortable. Second I tried another tub, I wish I could remember which one to warn you, but she just kept on slipping down to the bottom of that one despite its "no slip surface".Finally I tried the EuroBath. Never had a problem bathing my daughter in it. Its great for itty bitty babies, big babies, and even small toddlers. I used it all the way until my daughter was large enough to go into the tub herself.Only down side is that its huge. If you lack storage space, this can be annoying, but its definitely worth it.
No frills, sheer elegance in design! Love this bathtub. I was looking for a simple plastic design so that the tub would be easy to clean/sanitize with no mold issues. The closest highly rated blue whale tubFisher-Price Precious Planet Whale of a Tub(like most others), while really cute, has a tendency to develop mold in hidden crevices. The PRIEuro has no crevices. I have been using this since LO was 2 weeks old. She is 4 months now and still loves it. It is quite big in size but we have ample counter space on the vanity so it works well for us. Looking forward to using this until LO is a toddler!
This is by far the best purchase we've made for our son - at 2 months old he was 16 lbs, and too big for most tubs.  This one is perfect.  He absolutely LOVES it - he kicks and splashes and has so much fun in the bath!  It's very supportive, but at the same time, he has a lot of freedom to play.  Our 7 month old nephew took a bath in it the other night, and he loved it as well.  He sat up where my son lies, and also had support and freedom at the same time.  It's too large for our kitchen cabinet, but it works well inside a bathtub.  I would absolutely recommend it to any and every parent and/or grandparent.  Just be ready with your video camera the first time you put your child in it!
I got this tub on the advice of previous reviews and have to agree it's great.  It is big, I store mine on it's end in our linen closet and set it on the kitchen counter for baths.  My girls slipped around a little on the infant side until I put a burping cloth under them.  The wet fabric helped keep them in place.  My only complaint is the drain plug must have been stuck in backwards.  The force of the draining water blows it closed so I have to prop it open by sticking a pair of scissors through the hole.
We had a pretty big newborn (9lbs) so this worked really well for us.  I think I would be scared to put a baby littler than that in it though.  It is a HUGE tub.  If you don't plan on keeping it in the tub all the time...get a different tub.  I'm glad I have a basement because storing it anywhere else would be a pain.But the size is one of the reasons I love it too.  Son really likes kicking and splashing around in it and I feel he is very secure in there.  I love the little sections to put his shampoo and soap as well.  I love the little "out spout" it has too to empty it.
PROS:This tub is PERFECT for my 6 month old. It's nice and big, the water covers her whole body and she has room to splash and play with good support. She still uses the lying down position. We don't usually use the drain plug, it's light enough to just dump the water out.CON:For 0-3 months this tub had issues because it does not have the newborn sling.  (It looks like there are holes for one but there's nothing to buy from Primo).Our solution was to place a folded towel beneath her in the bath which did work great and provided her comfort and support while bathing.  You just have a soggy towel to wash after every bath which is taxing.
This was too big for our two month old and he was very uncomfortable. His neck is still unstable so I had to hold his neck the entire time while taking a bath rather than it whacking on the hard plastic. Also the protruding centerpiece is a good place to crush a baby's balls so watch out especially if he's too small to fit in the tub properly! I think this tub would be good for older infants or toddlers but not for our two month old. Hopefully in the future we can use it again.
This bath tub is very functional & cost efficient..considering you can use this for a very long time (just DON'T use chemicals to clean it/ USE Organic Cleaners!) All you would need is a little pad to put under baby's butt or back..everything else it perfect! It is a little on the Big side...so if you have a small place, I would invest in something a little smaller...GO TO [...] they have this bath tub & another one that is a little smaller, so you can actually hide it under a cabinet & not keep it out in th open all the time because of how big it is :) Just nail it to the wall (back of door) like I did :)
One thing I didn't understand when I registered for this online is that it's huge! We lived in a small one-bathroom condo when I had my first baby and it was difficult to find a place for this thing since we had to take it out of the tub every time we showered.If you have a bathroom that's just for the baby where you can leave the tub in there all the time, this tub is perfect. If, however, you bathe your baby in your own bathroom, consider getting the Sure Comfort tub that's smaller.
I used this bathtub from the day I brought my son home until he was old enough to climb out of it on his own. When he was really tiny we just put a rolled up waschloth at his groin to prop him up a bit more. But it was so nice that he could be supported but be deeper in the water. He stayed warmer and he was much more relaxed than when we bathed him in the standard baby tub at my parents house. As he got older we were able to let him splash and kick and explore so much more because the back is so supportive. Yes, it is a little large, but it has a drain in the bottom and we just stored it in the regular bathtub when we werent showering. Recommend it to all my moomy-to-be friends.
We didn't buy this seat until our daughter was 4 months old, because we were previously using the Puj tub. I only wish we had bought it sooner! I love the fact that it is non-toxic plastic, made in the USA, and can be used for many months. One side has a cradle seat for younger babies, and the other side has a round piece that keeps older babies who can sit up from slipping and falling. Right now our daughter is using the cradle piece, and loves that she can splash around. When she can sit up, we will put her on the other side. We will feel much safer putting her in this knowing that she won't be able to slip like she would in the regular bathtub. One of our best baby purchases!
I LOVE this tub! The moulded shapes hold my baby nicely and allow me to have my hands free to bathe him properly. We have been using it since he was three weeks old and it still works well. We always lay a towel in the bottom to keep him from slipping around and for comfort. The drain on the side is a nice convenience and makes emptying it easy. The only issue is it's size, but we found that it fits perfectly under the crib and we store all of the baby toys, towels and baby bath products inside.
My husband and I love this tub. So roomy and it's very clean/sleek looking! Our son was very cramped in his smaller tub at just 4 months of age! His toes would reach the end of the tub! My son is in the 90 percentile for his height & 60 percentile in weight.Now the reason why I gave it 4 stars: It is not ideal for newborns because it doesn't come with a hammock. From 0-4 months, the smaller tub was great for our son. It also allowed us to bathe our son standing up because the smaller tub fits on top of the kitchen sink. This tub does not. If you have a smaller baby, I don't recommend this for your newborn! In my opinion this is more ideal for babies who are 14lbs and up!
I really like this tub for my sitting baby. She still manages to swish herself around face down, despite the little barrier that sits between the baby's legs. But that's why you're never supposed to leave babies unattended in the bath. They can manage all sorts of crazy things when left to their own devices.The only reason I didn't give this tub 5 stars is because the white tub develops a little brown spot where her bum sits. I clean her thoroughly with wipes before each bath, so I'm not sure why this is happening, and she's never pooped in the tub. I've tried scrubbing it with baby-safe detergents, but it won't come off. It seems to be permanently stained. I'm too afraid to try bleach in that spot, since it's where the most sensitive part of her body rests in the tub. If I could have gotten another color for the same price, I would have.
This tub is the best- I wish I had bought it sooner. We had a 4 stage tub for our son, but he got really big and it didn't fit any more. I saw this tub listed in Baby Bargains (great book!) and decided to try it. I never used it for my son when he was an infant, but you can put the baby in one way and they recline, then face them the other way once they can sit up.This thing is fabulous! My son has a ton of room to splash around and play. In fact, now he hates to get out of the tub since has so much fun in there. The tub also has a spot to hold shampoo and bath wash bottles.
As the previous review stated, this is the perfect tub for a tall baby. Our 24 in tall 2 month old outgrew her 4Moms CleanWater tub and we wanted to find a tub she can continue to use as she grows. She loves this tub as she can kick her feet around with plenty of room. It seems to be made well and is super sturdy, we have been using it for a month and I can see using it until she grows out of it. Yes, it is big but we keep it in the bathtub of our spare bathroom all the time so it is not an issue. If you only have one bathroom and are low on storage space, you would probably want to look elsewhere but if you have the space, this is a must!
I don't use the drain feature, so that doesn't bother me (other people have said it's hard to drain.) I love that it's roomy and has a couple different options for seating. I lay my kiddo down to bathe him but allow him to sit up to play. Actually, he can switch himself between the different seating options now (he's 8 months), which worries me a little, that he's that mobile in the tub, but hey, I'm right there watching, so I guess it doesn't matter much, and it entertains him to move around and chase toys around the tub.
This is a big improvement over our previous tub, which had no built-in supports - only a separate chair on which our son would constantly be sliding downward.Three places for improvement:1. There is no stand, and apparently you can't purchase one.  I built my own to elevate the tub 6&#34;-7&#34; in order to save my back.  (I don't endorse this - a poorly built stand would present its own obvious risks).  Plus I feel safer being able to reach the baby easier.2. It doesn't drain fully on its own - it must be tipped later on after the baby is out.3. The middle support piece could be taller.  For the most part, it holds my 6-month-old in the reclining position.  However, the does a full-body kick (like in professional wrestling to escape a pin), and has almost managed to throw his whole body onto the top of the supporting piece.
I needed a bathtub that would work for both my infant son and my 3.5 year old daughter.  My daughter freaks out in the bathtub, and I thought that getting a smaller tub would help her to feel more secure.  I also needed a new infant tub.  I really like the size of this tub, because it is huge (though it still fits easily into my standard size tub).  It has a nice contoured reclined position on one side to hold my infant son, yet the sitting position on the opposite side provides ample space for my 3.5 year old daughter.  This is the second time I have purchased a Primo brand product (the first time was a Primo potty), and I have been very pleased both times.  I think that the plastic could be a little bit thicker, but I think it is durable enough to withstand several years of use.
My son is 7 months old...we've been using it since he was approx. 1 month. We used one of those "bear" shaped bath sponges to support him a little when he was tiny, but we're still using this tub and we love it! He's now able to sit up and play in it. I can see we'll be using it for a while! It's a good investment. It is large....you'll need space to store it or in our case we just keep it in the tub in our extra bathroom! You and your baby will love it!
This is the best baby bath tub out there.  It is large, taking up a good amount of space, but when hung on the wall (there is a hole in the top rim of the tub for this very use) it's simple to take down and set up and then give baby a bath.  We've used it in two of the homes we've lived in, and it's worked great in both.  I used it on the kitchen counter in our small condo (as we didn't have much space anywhere else) and then I used it on the large bathroom counter in our townhouse.I tried that sponge shape for our first son in the regular bathtub and that really hurt my back (and he didn't like lying down in the water).  This keeps baby's head elevated even when he can't support it; but baby can sit up on his own later in the other end...  Win win!
We purchased this tub in transparent blue. At first sight it seems HUGE. It's because the tub has two "sides". One for infants who need to lay reclined, and the other is for older babies/toddlers who can sit up with minimal or no support. Other reviews state that the drain is slow, but I wouldn't know....I use the tub inside our regular bath tub and dump it when we're finished. Our tub is stored hung on a nail on the bathroom door or turned over in the big tub. It's very ergonomic for baby and allows whoever is bathing baby to use both hands for washing. Have been using this tub for about four months and have NO complaints. Sturdy, easy to clean, easy to store, and my baby loves it! It also matches our blue themed bathroom quite nicely. Also the shipping time was great!
Our baby's umbilical cord stump fell of when she was just a few days old, so we bathed her in this tub.  She was too tiny for her arms to fit in the arm places, but it worked perfectly because she fit snugly and securely in the place that the body is supposed to go.  Baby won't slip under the water because of the plastic mouldings, so you can have both hands free to wash and reach. Once our baby was big enough to sit up, we put her on the other end (toddler end), and she plays and splashes, while still having the plastic molding so she can't slip back into the water.  She's 18 months old now and we fill the tub to the brim in the big bathtub.  This is a large baby tub, but it stores easily in the bathtub, cleans up very easily, and you will be able to use it for 2 years at least!  Well worth the extra $$.
My son is 9 months old and could be bathed in our regular bath tub without issues. However, bathing him in the tub kills my back! We have been using this tub on our kitchen counter since he was born and its the best thing. I can bathe him at a comfortable height without bending and kneeling. Now that he sits well unsupported he would rather sit, which this tub allows. But when he was a newborn he was able to lie down and be well supported. I think this tub is wonderful. It is large and spacious and I think it could easily be used well into the toddler years. My only complaint is the drain. We have to put a plastic spoon in the hole to keep it open, otherwise the water pressure pushes the plug shut while it's draining. Other than that, I absolutely love this and would recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to awkwardly bathe their child in the regular tub.
After our twins got too big for baths in the sink but still too small to just sit in a tub, we were at a loss.  All of tubs we saw were meant for one kid and we were hoping to be able to give them baths at the same time.  I finally saw the EuroBath and decided to try it out.  It worked fantastically!  One baby had to recline while the other partially sat up, but we could finally give them baths at the same time.  We've been using it for several months now with no problems whatsoever.  Our kids love it and so do we!
We used this bath tub with our first son and loved it. It truly  last a lot longer than most and is very safe with infants.However, i just re-ordered one for our second son and had to return it because we now live in a smaller space and it is way too big! If you live in a small place, consider that because it is very large and difficult to store.On a side note, the packaging was beyond awful. the box was damaged, not closed...bad bad bad
I was surprised at just how large this tub was when I received it. Literally, my 3 year old can take a bath in it. He LOVES it, and calls it his "boat". It is really sturdy. it has both positions for infant and toddler, so really can last a long time. If you are NOT looking for something large, this is not the tub for you :-)If you have a smaller infant (which I always do), I would think adding a sponge insert will help to allow even the smallest baby to fit.We love it!
This was such an upgrade from our last bath tub, my daughter is 5 months old and on the big side for height and weight. This tub is so large but in a good way. I'd just like to forewarn you do not need to put too much water into this tub since they are reclined so deeply into, and the only con is there isnt any grips on it so once your kid finds out how much fun it is in this tub they can jump around and thus slip around a bit- not bad-- but wanna keep a close eye on them.
This bathtub was recommended by one of my best friends, a supermom, and I am so glad I bought this on her advice!We've been using this tub since the little girl was a little under a month, and at first I needed to be more supportive of her as she'd squirm and start to slip one way or another.  But already at just 3 months she lays and splashes and plays in the little molding and we can float a duck around at her and clean her so easily as it supports her.  I love that we'll be able to keep using this bath as she grows into this little baby spa.The material is durable, the molding perfect for a little baby and the features are practical.  There is a max fill line and a little drain, though I really just flip it over after we bath her in our tub.  The biggest issue is storage - it would never have fit in our old apartment.  We leave it in the tub, flipped up to dry.
Everyone is right, this is a great tub for your little one.  My baby is 5 months old and was outgrowing the infant bathtub that sat on the sink.  He fits great into the infant side and he had a blast the first time he was in the tub.  It was the first time he could splash around and the first time Dad heard him laugh!  So worth it.  He doesn't find it so amusing anymore but it's great for me because I can give him a bath alone now instead of having to have another person hold him up in the tub.  Yes, the drain is really slow so I do what someone else does and use a large plastic cup to scoop the water out so I can refill with clean water.  But, no big deal since we use the cup to rinse his hair anyway.
This tub is bulky, but great.  It's like a real tub, and it does fit into a bath tub.  It is highly easy to keep clean.  And has two positions.  One is a reclining position for a younger infant.  In this position I would place a washcloth down before the baby to prevent sliding.  The second position is for infants to sit upright.  Great device.  Is something that could be used for years or passed to family and friends as a hand-me-down.  Well worth the price.  No mildew issues at all.
At first I thought this tub was ridiculously big, but my son loves it! I think it's so clever that you can have the baby in a lying down or sitting up position, depending on which way you put him in--this product is very durable and made to last until your child outgrows it! We even bought a second one for our summer house, because I can't imagine giving him a bath without it. My son is 9 1/2 months old and can sit up perfectly, but still prefers to "lounge" in it lying down. I put it on my kitchen island and bath him that way, so I don't kill my back in the bathroom. I also like that it's all plastic, no mesh or rubber mats that can mildew--it has a bump in the middle to keep the baby from sliding.
Our 6 month old outgrew her 4 stage bath tub & I wasn't comfortable readjusting it to fit a toddler.  This Eurobath is wonderful.  It is VERY roomy & baby enjoys splashing around. There is plenty of room for her toys.  It has a drain & I haven't had any problems with it.  It seems like it would have been perfect to bathe an infant too (since it has the special design to do so), but I didn't have it at the time.  I definitely recommend this tub!
Hands down BEST BATH EVER. This bathtub is awesome. We originally purchased a different tub, but at 4 months our baby outgrew that one so we opted to buy the PRI EuroBath. I only wish we'd bought this tub first. It is big, but its not any more cumbersome than a smaller tub. Our little man has plenty of room to splash around and he can rest comfortably in it with all of his bath toys. It is super easy to clean and a great great product. Don't bother buying the smaller tubs, go with this one!!
If you're looking for a tiny bathtub for your itty-bitty newborn baby, this might not be what you had in mind.  It's big.  It's not the sort of bathtub you plop in or on top of your kitchen sink (unless you've got a pretty big sink and you're very tall).  I actually use this inside our regular bathtub when bathing my daughter.  I used a bath cushion to give her extra support and comfort on her back/head when she was unable to sit up on her own.  And though she's able to sit up now, using this bath makes so much more sense than filling up the regular bathtub (which would require way more water).  I definitely foresee myself using this bath for my 7 month-old for several more months, and possibly a couple more years.
My son had his first bath in this tub. It's a bit large for a newborn. I had to use my forearm for support and bathe him with my other hand. The second time I used it, I used one of the mesh beds from another bath with this set. My son was in heaven.There's plenty of room in the tub. It's easy to drain. I usually drain a bit of the water mid-bath and add more water to make sure I'm getting all of the soap off.He is now 10-weeks and loves splashing his hands in the water. He looks forward to bath time.
I received the sure deluxe newborn to toddler tub at my shower, But my little girl outgrew the newborn side at 3 months, but was to small for the toddler side. Here bum would pop up over the plastic part that is suppose to keep her from going under. I  bought this tub and it is great! It is the only tub where she has been able to kick her feet and it holds her so i can bathe her with two hands. It is big, but fits perfectly in our tub and gives her so much room to play around. It has made the both of us so happy i only wish it was padded, but other then that it has been great!
after tried out 3 different tubs, i finally bought this one. i didn't want to buy this tub at the first place because it is a humongous tub. i kept trying out other tubs and kept returning them. so finally, my husband got tired of returning tubs, he picked out this one but i was still having doubt because it is so big. but, once i gave my daughter a bath in it, i knew that this is a good buy. my daughter wouldn't slip off in the tub and there is plenty of water to pour over her body and it takes less time to bath her.
I got this for my baby shower and I LOVE-Love-Love it.  I put it on my kitchen table after filling under sink, and drain it from the easy-drain spout right into the sink when I am done.  My baby Amelia has been in it since week 1 and she is 3 months and still loves it.  She fits perfectly in the newborn side, and I feel safe she won't slip down.  I can easily bathe her alone without problems.  Highly recommended, especially since the tub grows with you and your baby.
Once baby had outgrown the sink, we were stuck using the one I originally registered for - a "space saving" model. HATED that one. Too much work. Read reviews and bought this one - baby is now 15mos and we are still using it. LOVE it. One tip - for small infants, use one of those big sponge things to keep baby from sliding around, or put a wet handtowel behind them. Oh, and I use to store it on the back of a door. Used one of those stick-on-hooks to hold it up. Worked great, out of the way & able to dry out. Buying this for all of my girlfriends for their baby showers.
This tub is really nice.  The contoured area for the baby is just right, and it seems really safe.  My baby hated baths until I bought this tub, and now he is much happier.  I like this tub, but I agree with other reviewers that the drain is slow.  Also, the hard plastic is unpleasant for the baby, so I also bought the Safer Bather cushion.  I realize now, though, that I really didn't need that...a soft washcloth or cloth diaper would be enough.  I recommend this tub to anyone who wants to have good control of the bathing situation.  I feel much more at ease using this than I did using the sink because I know that my son is not going to slip into the water.
The tubs works great for my 6 month son, but I could not make it work when he was a newborn... He was just too small for the tub.And yes... its almost as big as a regular sized bath tub, but that's one of the things I like about it... more fun for my son.Taking off a star because of the plug... it doesn't stay open on its own... it keeps closing, which is annoying when you are trying to drain the water while your little one is in it.
So - We had one of the fancy schmancy Puj baths because of space concerns. The baby hated it.The baby loves this bath! He kicks and splashes and has a grand time. We place it next to the sink on the kitchen counter and it works wonderfully! My mommy group of over 80 women agree! This can be used for toddlers too as there is a sitting spot opposite of where the baby lays.We don't store it in the bathroom - it has a hole for a hook and we just hook it onto the back of the nursery closet door. (A tiny closet - but it fits!)This would be super useful for those without a bathtub and just a shower!
With a bad back and knees I have been bathing my child in the kitchen sink so that I can stand up, but she was getting far too big for it. When I saw this and read the reviews we ordered it. The first night I used it was fantastic. No longer do I have to hold onto our slippery baby with one hand and wash her with the other which is uncomfortable for the both of us. She can lay back and calm down at the end of the evening whilst I wash her with both hands and not have to worry about letting her slip and I love that when she's a little bit bigger she can switch ends and sit up on her own. Brilliant. Love it.
...or so my older friends tell me.  We were given a Diaper Genie for a shower gift and it proved so invaluable in the baby's nursery upstairs, we bought a second one for our downstairs changing table.  (we had been wrapping each diaper in a plastic bag and throwing them in the garbage - yuck!)Keep the instructions until you get the hang of loading your Genie - the Genie comes loaded with the first roll of plastic, and we had some trouble figuring out how to load the next roll because we didn't have the practice from the first roll and had misplaced the instructions.  It is easy to load but not so easy to figure out how it loads if you aren't paying attention or are sleep-deprived.
I don't know why the website will not let me have it at one star!  I DO NOT mean 5 stars!I bought the Diaper Dekor first based off these reviews online, and I hated it!!  I does not work at all. Then I got the diaper Gene and it's better but still I think it sucks. Not only do you have to buy the special liners (annoying and expensive) it's confusing to operate.  I finally just used a small trash can in my laundry room and empied it out every few days.  At least it didn't annoy me!!! :)  I am looking into the Diaper Champ now as it uses any regular trash bag.
For us this is a LIFE SAVER!!... It has been really helpfull... I even bought another one for my mother's house... Im agree with a lot of nice stuff from other reviews and Im not going to repeat them, but I have to say something about how many times it gets full.  It's not true that it gets full everyday.... or.... It would get full if you put the diapers open.... What you have to do is Fold the diaper together with the wipes that you use, and you would see the difference... I use to change it every 2 days, now It gets full every 4 days.... The refills are not expensive at all, and you could always get free refills at Babies R Us, buying 2 or 3 together....I use one refill every 3 weeks or so....I haven't try any other one in the market, but for me this is perfect, so I could say that is the BEST OPTION!!!
This product is worthwhile, because you are going to be changing diapers constantly, and you need to throw them away in some sort of sanitary and convenient manner. When baby starts eating solids, there is quite a different aroma coming from his diapers! This device is basically a garbage can, but it helps keep the nursery from getting stinky. The only thing is, because it holds so many diapers, it can make the nursery smell very "baby powder-y". So keep the room well ventilated. The Diaper Genie is easy to use, and the refills last a long time. If you happen to live in a building, with a garbage shoot on your floor, then you don't need this. Just put a day's worth of diapers in a plastic bag, and down the shoot.
I used this diaper pail when I had my first daughter a couple of years ago and I did not like it at all. I thought it was very difficult to use. (until you get used to it)  It didn't contain the smell well at all. The refills were a pain to put in and like another reviewer said it twisted when it wanted to.  The lid also kept coming off of mine. I threw this out and bought the safety 1st odorless diaper pail which I find contains the odor much better.
The Diaper Genie is great.  It helps eliminate diaper odors, thanks to the slightly powder scented bags, and that it seals off each dirty diaper.  It's convenient,  VERY easy to use, and most of all sanitary.  We'll have this thing filled to the gills with dirty diapers, and you wouldn't even know that any stinky diapers were in the baby's room!  When it is filled, just turn the knob to cut the bag, tie off, throw out, and start all over again with fresh clean bags!
I got this as a gift and loved it for the first six months.  Then I discovered what a waste of money it was.  Once solid foods were introduced into my son's diet, this didn't even come close to holding in the stench.  I even used the different types of refills that were made for it...ie. infant, original and toddler.  Still didn't do the trick.  I even put air fresheners in and near it....  Eventually I gave up and took dirty diapers straight out to the garage and only used it for pee diapers.  Still a hassle to remove the "diaper weenie" so now I just use a normal trash can.  Much less hassle and same results.
I love this product!! It makes a huge difference in how the changing room smells. I have seen negative reviews on this product, but I would guess that they haven't mastered how to use it. It is a little tricky. It would be nice if it held a few more diapers, and the cutting and changing of the refills is a little tricky, but I love it just the same. The sausage idea is great because it contains the smell when you open it to put another diaper in there. My 5 mo old laughs everytime she sees her father change it. He loves to go on about the poo-poo sausages that she is so talented at making...lol (Daddies are weird) When you get one make sure you read the directions twice
It's a neat idea...the problem is...the replacement bags cost too much and don't justify the convenience.  Honestly, my husband and I use the plastic bags that the daily newspaper comes in.  They are slim and hold about 7-10 diapers.  At the end of the day, we toss them out into the garage...end of story.  If you really need this kind of doodad, there is another type out there where you can use your own plastic bag...that's much better than this deal.
When my hand-me-down Diaper Genie broke, I bought a Diaper Champ. I figured I'd save some money not having to buy the Diaper Genie refills.Once I started using something different, I realized immediately just how wonderful the Diaper Genie really was. The odor protection the Diaper Genie provides is much superior to that of the other diaper pail. When I used the Diaper Genie, my son's room never smelled. With the other product, his room smelled horribly, even when I changed it daily!And, I found that the Diaper Genie really isn't any harder to use, and that it is much more pleasant to change, since all the diapers are sealed when you open the lid.Well, I'm back to using a Diaper Genie. Save your money and buy one the first time around. You'll have to spend a little more on refills, but your house won't smell, which really is the point behind a diaper pail.
It is a BIG WASTE OF MONEY. The Diaper genie is good for when your baby is an newborn (1-3 months) After they are 4 months there doo doo really stinks and the smell does come out a little bit even if you change it every other day. The inside gets  horrible smell like something died in it. It is very hard to replace the refill. Even though they discontinued selling the original they still sell the refills for the original right next to the the wide refills. So for my baby shower I recieved the original re-fill for my wide genie. And I did not notice it untill I tried to replace it so I already opened the origianl refill and some how broke the darn thing. So right now it is in the garbage. Money down the drain.
These cushions seem pricey, but they were the only ones we could find to buy, and going without some type of cushion on our brick hearth wasn't an option.  My 11 mo. old daughter started to pull a piece off the other day, but then she gave up and I pushed the piece back down fine.  What I really love about this product is the color of the foam that really blends right in with our living room decor, and the foam can be easily cut to fit perfectly, which we had to do.  My daughter loves to crawl up and sit on the hearth, and in her exuberance she's tumbled off before.  This cushion has directly protected her head a few times.
We got these becasue our new house has a brick fireplace with an elevated ledge.  Our daughter was just learning to walk when we moved in and as part of our baby-proofing we decided we needed something for the fireplace.  This was about the only option BRU had and it was a waste of money.  It didn't fit together right and then the adhesive didn't stick to the brick.  Plus when it was on our daughter seemed to be drawn to it! It never failed she wanted to go right to it and try to get it up.  So we just took it up and she's been fine without anything on it.  In fact, she's pretty much left it alone since we took this off.
We have a standard fireplace hearth (no odd angles) that is about 6 feet wide and this has worked out great.  It sticks to the brick without a problem and my 11mo old plays on our fireplace constantly.  Since we bought these from BabiesRUs He has managed to get one piece off but considering he weighs 25lbs and has been pulling at these constantly I'm only taking 1 star off.  Otherwise this is doing a great job keeping him safe and reapplying the one piece isn't that hard.I bought the brown ones and both my wife and I actually think it looks pretty good on our gray brick fireplace and brown tables.  We also bought a 4 pack of their edge guards after the first two brands we tried couldn't survive my son's curiousity.  I'm sure my kid will still find some weight to hurt himself but hopefully now it won't be a call 911 kind of hurt.
When I got my Simmons Changing Pad, this came with it free.  I'm afraid that this is going to get a poopy stain and gross me out to the point that I have to throw it away. It fits the pad great and feels much better to the skin than the plastic cover of the pad.  The terry cloth is so soft and makes the pad so comfy.I was shopping the other day and found that a division of Carter's also makes changing pad covers that will fit the Simmons pad.  They are a little cheaper, but only come in 4 or 5 colors.I read in a review for the Simmons Contoured Changing Pad that the plastic had ripped, so she had to throw it away.  I think that would be a good reason to buy one of these, because you could keep using the pad and just cover up the tear.
Although I do not have the Simmons changing pad, mine is the same measurement but the cover doesn't fit.  I am giving it 4 stars though, because if it did fit, it would be a good changing pad cover.  It is absorbant for times when you are mid diaper and there is an accident, and is much more comfortable than the plastic on the pad.  It wears up well to washing, and comes in many colors to match nearly any nursery.  If you do not have the Simmons changing pad, do not get this product, but if you do, this is a great product to have.
When I was a brand-new mom, eager to color-coordinate my baby's nursery, I bought terrycloth changing pag covers in almost every shade available. Good thing I bought so many, because each time baby oozed, leaked, squirted, spit up, fountained, or otherwise made a baby mess, I would have to carefully fit the straps back through the strap holes, then remove the pad cover, toss it in the wash, and put a new cover on. Doesn't sound like much work, but considering how many messes babies can make, changing the pad gets to be almost a daily chore. On top of that, the terrycloth just doesn't clean well, even with those special baby-stain removers and even with Shout! It's much easier (and less costly and less stressful and less time consuming) to use the bare changing pad and simply wipe down any messes with diaper wipes or with a gentle cleanser. Don't waste your money buying pad covers.
We bought 3 originally and when one was washed it had a hole in it instantly and I could see why.  These are not the most durable covers made.  So, we bought cradle size lap pads and keep one over the cover.  It works wonderfully and is easy to pick up and put in the hamper if it gets dirty.  Plus, they are cheaper.  So, we have the nice clean look of a white cover and put the lap pad over top of it.  Works great!
I have two of these changing pad covers and used them both for a year with my first child. They are mediocre. I noticed that the material frayed around the elastic after a few months of use. I stitched them back up, but it looks kind of cruddy and the material continues to unravel in new places. I agree with one of the other comments regarding a slit for the safety strap...one is not present. Finally, I used it with the changing pad by "Especially for Baby" and the fit was a bit too tight which resulted in the pad curving a bit over time.For a few more dollars, I would strongly recommend looking at Pottery Barn Kids' chamois pad covers. They are extrememly soft (you'll wish your sheets were made out of this stuff!), have the safety strap slits and fit the changing pad perfectly.
I registered for this item because it goes with the changing pad that I chose.  I can't believe that this cover is made by the same manufacturer as the pad!  It doesn't fit well.  It has no holes for the safety straps on the pad to fit through.  I cut small holes to pull the straps through, and they were all frayed after just one washing.  In fact, the entire cover is already covered with frays and snags after only two weeks of use!  The material is rough and cheap.  My husband and I have opted for covering the pad with a clean bath towel every day.  It's softer and easier.  We will look for another option, but until we find one, this cover is not the answer!
We have two of these that we rotate and they work just fine for us. We also have the contoured changing pad by Simmons. True, they do seem a little small straight out of the dryer (the cover stretches straight across the top of the pad), but after one changing our baby's weight shapes it right into place. That's really never bothered me. And considering how often they are washed, they are really holding up well.My only complaint (and why I didn't give it five stars) is that they could be a little softer.
This changing pad cover works great on the Especially for Baby Contour Changing Pad. I have one in white and one in green (the green matches my Malawi bedding really well.) I washed and dried them many times. All of the stains came out and they stayed soft and didn't shrink much. I did have to stretch them a bit to get them on, but once in place they fit perfectly. The straps on the pad I have are attached at the bottom so I didn't need to cut any holes in the cover in order to be able to use the straps. I also use small changing pads so that I don't have to change and wash the cover that often. I like that I can put my baby on something soft and warm instead of the cold plastic pad. I definitely recommend getting these.
This terry cloth cover has been a lifesaver. It covers the cold vynil of my changing pad. It cover the big fat rips in my vynil changing pads too, so that you would never know that its ripped. It has caught numerous undiapered poops and pees and went right into the wash without having to wipe a thing up. That was my favorite quality of it.I have two of these so that when one is in the wash the other is on the changing pad. The only beef that I have with it is that after the first wash, one of the Terry covers ripped at the seam. Thats ok though, it was fixed quickly with a few stitches. No matter what it was a GREAT BUY.
Not too happy with this monitor.  We thought about replacing it early on but it was ok enough to just deal with the static.  My husband became the master of turning it down just enough to tolerate the sounds but hear the baby when he cried.  We used it for 7 months, every day during naps and night, and today the power adapter quit working so the only way to use it is with the 9v battery which lasts all of 3 hours before crapping out.  So, in summary: it will work but it's not a very good product and doesn't seem to have quality components to make it last.  Would probably be a better idea to just to buy a more expensive one out of the gate since you'll be spending that amount of money anyway once you buy something to replace this one when it dies.
We got this as a gift at our baby shower two years ago. I am very glad we did. This is almost a MUST have for babies.The range is fantastic. I can be outside watching my two year old while my baby sleeps. I know that I will be able to hear her. Not only is the range great but it also picks up the smallest sounds, I hear my baby rolling over in her crib when this is on. As an added bonus, I have not found this to be a battery eater.In my opinion having a moniter is not the most important thing to have if you are having a baby. However, it is one of the more useful things if you want to have some measure of freedom while the baby is napping or if your child sleeps clear across the house from where you sleep.
This is a great product for anyone living in America or overseas like we are. Our apartment is made with solid concrete and I am able to hear the monitor all the way in the front of the house. We have an older child that likes to play loudly so we put the baby in the back bedroom and I am able to hear when she wakes up. I think if I were to buy another monitor I would get one that has a video camera in it, so I could also see what was going on. But this is a great product considering the price.
I got exactly what I was hoping for - a simple inexpensive baby monitor without all the bells and whistles. The transmitter is downstairs in the baby's room and the parent receiver is upstairs in the kitchen. No, the sound quality is not perfect but it is great for the price. I can't hear every breath she takes but I can hear when she's in her bed playing and I can hear when she's crying. I don't get any static.My only real complaint with this is that it takes a 9V batter (or can be plugged in) but the battery is not rechargeable. I usually have it plugged in so I can't comment on how long the battery lasts.
If you want a monitor that's super sensitive, get this one. I could be laying in bed in the same room as the baby bed, and my husband will come in from another room cause he heard the baby fuss when I couldn't. I'm not kidding, the way we know when we've got it to the correct volume is when we can hear the clock ticking. I can't hear the clock just sitting a few feet away from it, but this baby monitor can hear it clear across the room.Just don't unplug the transmitter while the receiver is still on... it's LOOOOOOOOOUD static.
FINALLY HAD OUR BABY AND GOT TO TRY IT OUT..THE FIRST TIME I HOOKED IT UP WAS WHEN I RECIEVED IT, I DID HEAR THE NEIGHBORS MONITOR A LITTLE..BUT ALMOST ALL BABY MONITORS WILL HAVE THAT PROB. UNLESS YOU WANT TO SPEND ALOT OF $..BUT THIS HAS 2 CHANNELS TO CHOOSE FROM.. SO JUST SWITCH IT..THAT SIMPLE..I HAVE HAD IT ON FOR LAST FEW DAYS AND WORKS PERFECT..VERY SENSITIVE, AND ALMOST NO HISSING OR BUZZING AT ALL.. AND DOESNT NEED TO BE TURNED UP VERY LOUD..JUST SET IT RIGHT NEXT TO THE CRIB ON A TABLE....VERY HAPPY WITH IT
The best part of this monitor is the price. You really can't beat it. You can tell in the quality of the construction. They're very light cheap plastic. But I don't think that really matters as long as it works. I had originally bought one and it worked very well. It was crystal clear so I was impressed for the money I had spent. I then made the mistake of buying a second monitor for my second child's room when my old monitor conked out. Unfortunately even putting each one on separate channels (there are 2 to pick from) the reception became terrible. I could hear each bedroom from each monitor along with screeching static. I ended up having to shelve the second monitor and get a more expensive unit. If you only need one it will probably work great for you. However if you need two, save your money and get a better unit with more channels.
We got this free with a $75 purchase at Toys R Us so we took our original choice off of our registry.  Maybe we just got a bad one because the other reviews seem to be favorable.  Unlike the others, I didn't think it was that clear.  Yes, you can hear the baby breathe but there is also a static sound like air rushing through.  If you can sleep with &quot;white noise,&quot; you may be OK but it drives me nuts.  Also, our batteries have lasted an average of 3 - 5 days.  After going through 6 of them, we started using the plug full time.  This is a hassle because you have to unplug and replug it every time you change rooms.  I don't have any other monitors to compare it to but I don't think it's so great.
I read lots of reviews before purchasing this monitor. My grand daughter is now 11 months old and I watch her during the day while her parents are at work. During the day she takes two naps. She always wakes happy but before the monitor I did not hear her until she cried. Now I am able to clearly hear when she wakes and begins playing with her crib toys and am able to respond before she becomes stressed. Also I know exactly when she drifts off to sleep. There is occasional static but it is very low. My daughter-in-law spent a lot more money for something not nearly as good. In my opinion for the money this is the absolute best product on the market hands down.
this is a bare bones baby monitor, but it does what it's supposed to do. we get strong reception throughout our 3 level house with ceramic tile floors and thick walls.  we can hear even very quiet things like our girl's soft snoring and the rustling of sheets.  i have no need for a super fancy monitor -- i just want to know if the baby is asleep or awake and needs tending to.  this monitor is all i need for that.we've been using this monitor for about 6 months now and have had no problems with it. i was a bit hestitant to order when i saw how many people had problems with the product, but thought it was worth a shot.
I owned one of these 5 years ago and it worked reasonably well, so got another one this time around (previous one was given to my SIL).  I don't know what they've changed, but this one is bad enough I'm going to break down and order something else.  We've had trouble finding an outlet we can use that doesn't have other major interference (like if the alarm clock or toaster is on the same circuit).  Plus, for some reason we're picking up another kid and their family that is no where around us (no babies within 2 houses in any direction).  I can't imagine what they've heard us say based on what we've heard!  Going to replace it with the V-tech which is less than twice as much...wish I'd put the money into that to begin with.
We bought this because my 2 year old lost the cord to our old monitor.  This is a cheap monitor that does the job.  If you are looking for crystal clear & no interference then you will have to spend more than $16.  It does have some occasional interference, but you just move it a little or switch the channel & it is fine.  It also has some "white noise" in the background much of the time, but it's minimal.  It is a cheap, simple monitor that works well.  It fit our budget & our needs and I have been happy with it.
no plastic-leaching worries from these bottles due to potential dangers of #7 plastic bottles that most plastic baby bottles are made of. i was also surprised at how affordable they were. the item was shipped quickly. my only slight complaint is that i wish these came with silicone nipples instead.also, my opinion is that there's no need to buy a 4oz bottle since babies will quickly grow out of that stage. if you're short on money, just get the 8oz ones - you'll be holding the bottle when feeding a baby who can  only consume smaller amount of milk, so no need to worry about the larger size for the baby.
These are good basic bottles.  Going to the baby store and shopping for baby bottles as a new parent was daunting.  There's a litany of choices and every imaginable variation on design.  How do you choose?  For us, it became simple when we decided to stick to glass bottles.  There aren't many choices out there in glass, and those that are available are usually very expensive.  Our daughter has had no problems eating whatsoever so I can't say anything about any of the specialty bottles on the market, but for most babies, I can't imagine needing more than a basic bottle.  These are more or less the time tested glass baby bottle.  Basic and no frills, but solid and sturdy.  We like them a lot, and the price is very affordable.
I use these to pump into and then to store the milk in the fridge. If I'm pumping to freeze, then I store in the Dr. Brown's bags. Glass bottles are fantastic- they're the absolute best for preserving your milk, easy to boil and sanitize, great price, and they can go in the dishwasher. I would definitely have directly bottle fed my daughter with these, but she absolutely refused any bottle, that didn't look and feel more like mama. However, my best friend has EBF three babies for a year and all three took to this bottle no problem, when she returned to work each time. So, I'm hoping that when my daughter's older she may take to them (she's only 3 months) but in the meantime, I use the lansino moMMa bottles for feeding, and she has no issues with those. Also, if you've ever had coca cola in a glass bottle versus coca cola in a plastic bottle, you can definitely appreciate how glass preserves the flavor- ijs
These little bottles are surprisingly strong and light weight for what they are, which is a glass bottle.  While they can shatter, it takes a lot to get them there thanks to their compact build.  On top of that, you don't need to worry about BPA.The only problem with these bottles is that they have to be screwed down just right to allow airflow into the bottle and prevent baby from gulping air.  This can be solved with a nipple that Gerber puts out made of brown silicone that has a cross cut in the side of the nipple.  It's absolutely perfect for these little bottles.
We used Avent with our first child, and had that for our daughter too. However, she had a lot of issues with gas so we tried different bottles. After asking around we landed on these, and were thrilled. She uses a medium flow nipple at 10 months, and she hardly has gas issues anymore. That being said, if you can check out local stores as they were half the price of what they are here on Amazon. I love you Amazon, but your prices are getting steep.There has been one bottle that got a crack in it, but I even dropped a bottle on to our concrete floor and it did not break. Also, for formula these bottles are very narrow in the neck. I ended up making my own funnel with an old breastpump attachment, which makes it a lot less messy.
These are great bottles. I used them from day one until 6 months old. The only reason I don't use them anymore is my daughter is interested in holding her own bottle sometimes now and plastic is easier for her to hang onto because it's lighter. I love the glass bottles though because they keep the milk cool longer, important when pumping at work and using one of those little coolers. And they heat the milk up faster when placed in a warm water bath. They're very sturdy - I've dropped them several times and they haven't cracked or chipped. These come with nipples and the covers. I highly recommend these.
The bottles are nice but as it is warned in the product, the temperature difference along the cleaning process can make the bottle to brake down. This has happened to me in two out of the three bottles. It is true that I have not been careful enough, waiting for the necessary amount of time for the bottle to cool off before filling it with with cold milk. Nevertheless this problem makes it a little unpractical when you have a little baby and you need to feed him as quick as possible and you are in a hurry. The numbers in the bottles also are difficult to be read.
I knew even before I was pregnant that I wanted to use glass bottles- I don't believe that BPA-free means "safe," so I wanted to use something I could trust. These bottles are great (they come in two sizes; this review is for the larger, 8oz size). I freeze milk in them and defrost them in warm water and we have never had a crack or break yet. They wash better than plastic bottles because you can see the fat from the milk left on them when they are still dirty- it's hard to see that in the plastic bottles. They are easy to clean and not too heavy, but still strong enough to freeze/thaw multiple times. My daughter was able to hold them herself (of course we hover while she does that) and drink a bit when she was just a few months old, so they are not these huge and bulky bottles. Good quality and better safety.
These bottles are super good quality. I recently switched to them and it's so nice to be able to leave my baby's water in the car and not have it get plastic in it from the bottle. My baby loves these bottles. I bought some nipples for older babies but didn't have to use them because she likes the ones that came with these bottles even though she's 20 months old. I just use them for water (I don't like sippy cups). I don't know why someone said these bottles leak because I've never had a problem. It's great that they are making glass bottles again these days- finally the world is wising up and getting healthier!
None of my kids use bottles anymore, but when they did I went through so many brands and types of bottles trying to find one that I liked. My final choice was to settle on these glass bottles. They last so much longer than the plastic bottles. All of the plastic bottles that I tried got to a point where no matter how well I washed them, how hot the water was, even going through the dishwasher didn't get the formula smell out of them. Glass bottles are so much easier to clean, and so much easier to run through the dishwasher. Plus, in the diswasher the plastic bottles were never completely dried in the drying cycle. Not a problem with glass bottles.
These are simple glass baby bottles.  They're not fancy, but they have no nasty chemicals. I know that the plastic bottles are now all BPA free, but who knows what chemical they'll discover next year that's been leeching out of our plastic and poisoning us all this time.These bottles are compatible with my medela pump and can take the same lids, which is convenient.  However, for a breast-fed baby, even these so-called slow flow nipples are way too fast, and caused my baby to choke.  I bought Dr. Brown's nipples, which work great.  I now have these in 4 oz and 8 oz sizes.
First off, I really appreciate the fact that these bottles are made of glass, as opposed to plastic. We try to limit food and beverages consumed in plastic. These aren't fancy and are a great price. You can skip the 4oz bottles and just get a bunch of 8oz ones. Your child will eventually use just the 8oz ones and in the mean time, you can just fill them up with 4oz.While they are great, the rings and nipples may need to be replaced. They are not expensive though, so it's not a huge problem. Our daughter however did not like these as much as the Playtex drop ins. She really had a hard time sucking them. She would have to stop drinking and we would have to wait for all of the air to flow back in before she could continue. Maybe we just had faulty nipples. I'm not sure. I would be willing to give them another try though with our next child.
These bottles have been perfect for us.  We started bottle-feeding out of necessity when our baby was only 6 weeks old, and these bottles have worked perfectly.  They're BPA free, which means we don't have to worry about heating them.  We haven't had any trouble with the nipples, and we're currently using the Stage 2 (3-6 months) size.We love these bottles and their classic design.  And the price is great (BPA-Free plastic bottles often cost $12 each).  If you are bottle-feeding, I would recommend getting at least 12-15 of them so you don't have to wash and sterilize bottles everyday.
I recommend the large quilted multi-use pad in addition.  I have about 4 of them and they are essential.  I use John Lennon receiving blankets (6 is a good number) with an quilted absorbing pad underneath to be prepared for spills and smudges on my contoured changing pad. I do the same on his crib to save me the headache of changing crib sheets which are very tedious to get off and on. It's nearly impossible to do when you've had a c-section, and not a good idea to strain yourself.
I purchased two of these mattress pads two years ago for my son's crib.  This pad is so easy to put on and take off the mattress.  It fits a standard crib mattress PERFECTLY, and lays nice and flat.  It washes up easily, and does NOT shrink!  It's soft and durable, and it has NEVER leaked!  Oh, and compared to many mattress pads that cost up to $19.99 each- this pad is a super deal!I was so pleased with this product that I'd buy it all over again- and I will.  We are expecting TWINS this spring, and I plan on purchasing two more mattress pads for our second crib!I reccommend purchasing TWO for those middle of the night messes, that way you can change the sheets and pad in the middle of the night and not worry about washing the soiled pad till you wake up the next morning.  :)
I like this mattress pad cover b/c it's much easier to put on than the Evenflo one I have.  My Evenflo one you have to tug, pull, and stetch to get it on and even then it's not on perfect, a real pain.  It does &quot;pill&quot; a little after being washed, but it doesn't concern me, you put a sheet over it anyway.  My 5 month old daughter's diaper has leaked a couple of times overnight and the mattress stayed dry, that's all I need!
I have an average sized mattress and this fits perfectly!  It is super easy to install!  If it &quot;bunches up&quot; like some others suggest, it is because it isn't put on the mattress correctly.  A little tug, and it goes right in place... kind of like a normal bed sheet, know what I mean?After washing, many lint balls pile up, but it is durable in the fact that it isn't falling apart!  Just because it collects lint balls doesn't make it any less durable in my honest opinion.I recommend at least two of these!
My baby is breast fed and I needed to start pumping and bottle feeding before heading back to work after 12 wks of maternity leave. Baby would NOT take ANY nipple out there! We tried over 8 different nipples and bottle types. FINALLY this nipple worked! I believe most of it was my prayers asking the Lord to please help this baby take the bottle, but the nipple is the only one that he would take to! Also, amazon is one of the only places I've found that you can actually purchase this nipple! Great buy!
we tried these nipples after using the Nuk orthodontic latex nipples because we needed to step up the flow and Nuk doesn't make their nipples in anything other than a slow flow (at least, i couldn't find them if they do). however, my breastfed baby did not like them. the base of the nipple looks more rounded in the images than it is--it's actually quite flat. we found that our son preferred something he could put his whole mouth around, as it would more closely resemble nursing. these nipples were a no-go. we ended up just making the hole bigger in the Nuk nipples and that seemed to do the trick. it's too bad Nuk doesn't make a medium flow nipple, but these definitely were not a good alternative.
I really like Avent's versatility; the nipples, spouts, cups, bottles and handles can all be used interchangeably.I don't like the way they classify their nipples.  Each nipple has 3 classifications.  I wish they would only use one classification system because it can be quite confusing if you go to buy different nipples.1.) flow2.) baby's age3.) a numberAlso, the title of the item doesn't say what age or number of nipple this is, and there currently isn't a description.FYI:They are number 3 for 3+ months.
I love the ease of the avent bottles for feeding, cleaning, transporting.....everything.  When I found out the bottle design changed, I didn't want to have to re-buy all new bottles ( because the nipple design changed to fit and perform with the new bottle too).  I went to several local stores that were already sold out so came here to stock up.  I bought all the sizes I will need in the future.  Also, these nipples fit in the avent trainer sippy cups.  This is great for my little one since he didn't understand how to use the spout on the one that came with the cup.
I thought I need to change the nipples since my baby is already 100 days old :P. But after trying size 3 for four times, I'm certain that this size is too big for him. Yes, he drinks really really fast by using size 3, but he dripped three times more than when he's using size 2 nipples. So I switched back to size 2 for now. Don't get me wrong, I like Avent nipples and I'm sure size 3 will work just as well as size 2 in the future, but perhaps it shouldn't be labeled as 3 mo+.....
I have a 4.5 month old and these newborn nipples are too fast for my breastfed baby. He guzzles a 4 ounce bottle in less than 5 minutes, which is HORRIBLE for a breastfed baby. He doesnt know when hes full and ends up spitting up a ton after feeds. He also ends up with an upset tummy and is extra gassy because of them. Since this is the slowest flow Avent offers, Ive had to look for new bottles. I wish they made slower flow nipples because I really do like the bottles.
This is quite ingenious!  I don't know if any other manufacturers have them, but they are such a great idea.  Instead of a hole there is a slot in the top.  Around the side are the marks I,II and III.  You line up the marks with the baby's nose and that dictates how fast the flow of milk is. This teat allows a thicker liquid to flow through so you can add rice or another cereal of your choice if you need to.  My baby is in the 90th percentile and at 8 weeks old Milk just wasn't enough.  I put 1 tablespoon of rice in with 4 ounces of milk initially and then later on increased that to 2 tablespoons (all with doctor's approval).  It is a much thicker liquid but flowed through this teat easily.  I highly recommend these.
These nipples worked great at first but about 2 weeks before we were to switch to the next size my grandson started to collapse them and he got a blister on his top lip from sucking so vigorous. When we finally did switch him (at the proper time) to the next nipple he kinda gagged as he wasn't used to getting so much milk / formula.  But we are still using these nipples just might switch him sooner if he starts to collapse the size he is in so he won't have to suck so hard or get another blister.
My granddaughter is eating baby food now, but for the more runny foods, I find it much easier to mix the food with formula & give it to her in a bottle.  I also mix cereal and feed it this way, especially first thing in the morning, when she is impatient to eat.  I had a difficult time cutting holes in the regular nipples to allow proper flow of this mixture.  It ended up flowing either too fast or not fast enough.  This nipple works great, because as she is nursing, I can simply turn the bottle to the best spot for the perfect flow.  What a great idea!  Happy baby makes Grandma happy!
The avent nipples are our babies favorite, 6 months flows really fast, the 3 month (3hole) is what we still use at her 6 months. If you use cereal, you will need the 4 hole (6month) to get done in a resonable time!!!!formula normal eater= 3 hole (3 month)Formula slow easter= 2 hole (entry)Formula normal eater with Cereal= 4 hole (6 month)Our girl eats formula, and cereal with veggies anf fruit. she does not get cereal in the bottle, as it took to long, but when she is ready to eat quickly we will go to the 4 hole (6 month)nipple.All in all, beast the rest, buy the best!!
We started out with the Size 1 AVENT nipple and then when our son was around two months we switched to size 2 and once he got to be around 3.5 we moved him to size 3. It definitely has a faster flow than size 2 and he is able to take his bottle a lot faster. It took him a little time to get used to the faster flow, but he does fine with it now (five months old). I don't plan to move up to a size 4, I'll just stick with the size 3 until he is weaned. Our son is exclusively formula fed.
I like the avent nipples because they don't deform like the medela ones. I haven't tried many nipples since he seemed to do fine on these. These are the newborn flow ones and although they are the slowest, it's still not slow enough. I'm trying to breast feed and sometimes he just gets impatient with me (I have a low supply) and wants the bottle. Sometimes I oblige depending on how loud he is and how tired I am.But these are easy to clean and switch out too. I bought these to put into some "2" nipples I had since I got a set of these avent bottles.
These bottle nipples work as intended. Our baby never did the jump to the largest ones (I.e. fast flow, etc), so we had to keep using this kind for several months. The thing is that, at the end of their lifetime, the 2 holes on top widen and allow more liquid to go through. When that happened, the baby would refuse to drink anymore and it was really frustrating. I'm not knocking off any stars on this review because it is not really a defect or downside. It's jut the result of normal &#8220;&#34;wear an tear&#8221;. Just be mindful of it.
We brought these nipples based on all the raving reviews and write up's online.  However our newborn is now here and wasn't putting on enough weight.  Our pediatrician told us these are the worse brand of bottles on the market for newborns and shouldn't be used until the baby is at least 5 months old.  The reason for this is because the nipple is too large for a newborn to latch on to and they're unable to get enough.  We are now using the Medela nipples instead and he's feeding so much better.
I purchased these because the regular nipples on my wide-neck Dr. Brown bottles have too fast of a flow for my 3 week old (side note: these fit the Dr. Brown's wide-neck bottles perfectly). These Avent #1 nipples have the same problem: they are just too darn fast. My son choked on the milk from his bottle when we used these because the milk was pouring into his mouth. I see that some other reviewers with newborns have loved this nipple.  I guess every infant's needs are different.
We like Avent brand nipples bc they are durable and not overly flexible. My son is teething and these nipples hold up well amidst his chewing/gumming. Nipples are not as flexible as other brands (Playtex for example) which helps against excess dripping when my son wolfs his formula down. These do seem to be a slightly slower flow than other medium level nipples however. We have &#34;up sized&#34; Avent nipples quicker than other brands. These nipples also seem to work well w my son's reflux. Will continue to purchase.
Our son has bad congestion and it takes a lot of work for him to eat. Switching up to a level 3 has been great for him in terms of being able to take in more forumla.  He was eating anywhere from 30 to 120 cc before, now he is eating 150+ because he isn't expending all his energy trying to breathe and suck at the same time.  It's also cut down on the amount of time it takes to feed him.  Have not noticed more spit up or gas with the level 3 compared with the level 1.  Wish I had started using these earlier but all the nurses and doctors recommended using the Preemie nipple!
I am an exclusive bfing mom, so when it got close to time to go back to work I started working with baby to take his milk from a bottle. I have always used the Avent brand. The nipple is wide enough for baby as to hopefully prevent nipple confusion. But when I tried giving my son a bottle he sucked a few seconds then started to cough. I started to play with the nipple by pointing it sideways and I barely squeezed it and the milk came out quite effortlessly. I also turned it upside down and instead of a slow drip is was a stream. After waiting a few days I tried my son again on the bottle with the other nipple and the same problem arose the milk was just coming out too fast. I ended having to use a different brand entirely. Now though at almost four months my little guy taked this nipple like a champ.
My son is breastfed and sometimes takes a bottle of pumped milk when i am away...the variable flow nipples seem to flow the same no matter which side you hold it on (I,II or III).  I have used the other nipples (1, 2,3) and the flow seems to be slower than the variable.  Milk just goes everywhere ....i think i will hold off on using the variable flow nipples until he is a bit older....great concept, they just didn't work as great as i thought they would.
We purchased these straps for four bookshelves lined up on a wall just a bit longer than the shelves. I'm sure if we had been installing one piece of furniture, moving it to the left or the right to attach two straps to the studs (or each shelf had been significantly wider) there wouldn't have been any problem, but for our setup it didn't work. The only thing that worked for our shelves was centering each in front of one stud and hooking one strap to the back. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any other options that didn't involve using a stud (I anticipated this problem). These looked like the best and sturdiest option while also remaining slightly flexible. We have had them attached to the wall for about a week now and they seem as though they'll do the job!
I bought these after my son yanked open a drawer on a 5 drawer dresser and it tipped and fell on him. I was standing right there and was able to catch it and break the fall. If it had fallen on him I doubt he could have survived. We strapped everything in the house to the walls and found these straps to be easy to use. Its an added peace of mind having these in case I am ever not there to catch a falling dresser. Buy them, use them, prevent serious injury.
I love that this gate installs very easily, and the gate swings both ways.  We installed this in a bedroom frame, and easily moved it to over the stairs. I love that it doesn't leave any residue on the walls. Be sure the use the wrench it comes with which makes it very easy.The measurements it gives you are pretty accurate for the max length it can do, our stairway is just over 39" and it barely doesn't fit with the first extension so we had to add another.
We put it in a doorway that we walk through constantly, I can open it with no hands (i.e. holding the baby)  It keeps out the dog (about 65 pounder) and withstands some jail bar style shaking from my 1 year old.  I can leave the gate open, walking through is a bit narrow for my wide hips, but I don't have to turn sideways or anything.Get it, you won't regret it.  looks nice, easy to install, keeps out the dog and the baby in!
Fantastic gate extremely easy to install.  There are no little places where kids can get their fingers pinched so I feel safe closing it even when my extremely curious and active 8 month old is crawling and climbing on it.  it's a tall gate so i don't worry about her going over it at all and it takes force to push the step down but easy to do.  Buy it for the entrance to hallways or in doorways where you want the door open sometimes but don't want babies in and out of that room.
Nice and sturdy! Easy to install and use. It has hands-free opening so its good when you have your hands full like I always do. This gate wont budge when it is installed so it is very safe. It looks nicer then some of the other gates on the market.We still have this years later and got a second one when we moved. My oldest is almost 4 and she still cant open it on her own. She isn't heavy enough for the peddle. Still loving it!
We are so glad that we bought this gate. We use it in the entrance to our son's room. It keeps him in and our 3 dogs out. Completly hands free is such a plus!!!!!! Simple to use!!! Fits very snug...it isn't going anywhere. The vertical only slats are great because our son tries to climb this gate and I truely believe that if we had bought a traditional gate with vertical and horizontal slats that he would be able to climb it!!! I recommended this to all our friends already!!!
I purchased one of these back in 2003 (for our dog).  Now I wanted another pressure-mounted, hands-free gate for our toddler and this is the product I immediately thought of purchasing.I was extremely disappointed when I received the gate and realized that there is no longer a ramp to help prevent tripping over the lower bar.  I thought that feature was one of the main advantages of the older gate version.  Why would the manufacturer discontinue that?  Surely it would not cost a lot more to include that piece, and I think parents would be willing to pay a few extra dollars for added safety.Fortunately I was able to find another product that solved the problem for me:Tee-Zed Dreambaby No-Trip Gate Ramp, WhiteIt's not as perfect a fit as the original ramp, but it still works very well.  Kudos to Dreambaby for thinking of selling such a product.  I wish The First Years product manager would reconsider including the ramp with this gate.
The hands-freeness of this gate makes me so happy. I can walk through it with a baby in my arms and other junk in my hands, and I don't have any trouble getting it open. The foot pedal requires a lot of pressure, so my five year old has a hard time getting in and out, but that is okay because sometimes I want to keep her out of the kitchen, too! The installation was a breeze, and the gate has not moved a millimeter since I put it up despite being pulled on by both the baby and the five year-old. And what pleases me most is that I cannot find a place anywhere on the gate for fingers to be pinched at any stage of being open, closed or closing. We are using one extension with this gate. The measurements of it (the gate) and what space it will fit (with/without extensions) is accurate too.
I have a puggle and boxer, and neither one can jump this gate or accidentally open it. It's the best gate I've ever owned- and I've gone through a LOT of gates!! It is so easy to install- did it myself and I'm not usually good at putting things together. Easy!! Great when I'm taking groceries in the house and don't have an extra hand to fiddle with one of those tricky gate locks. LOVE IT!!! It doesn't leave "marks" on the trim or "damage" the walls... some reviewers must be over-tightening their gates if they're having that much trouble. It also has NEVER shifted out of place- ever... and I've had it in a high traffic area (where it's used over and over throughout the day)for nearly 3 months. Great gate- worth the money!
We've tried at least three different gates in different doorways and entrances, and this one's by far the best. It really is hands-free to open. Better yet, it closes automatically by bumping it shut, unlike some gates that require a hand to *close* them, argh.One complaint I've heard is about the foot pedal breaking off. That hasn't happened for us, and we use two of these, nor has it happened for friends (and friends of friends) who've had one of these for several years. I suspect that anyone's who broke had the gate in the entrance either too tightly or crooked. So, use the tool that comes in the box for checking the tightness, and use a level(ing device) to get it straight.
Utilized these for our stairs and they work very well.  I was surprised how nice they looked once they arrived.  Being able to utilize a step to unlatch the gate is very nice to have, seeing as our kid or some other object seems to be in our hands every time we go up and down the stairs.However, we required two extensions on each of the gates we purchased in order to get to the appropriate width for our staircases so I would recommend making sure you measure your stairs before ordering this gate and the necessary extensions.
I Only rate this item 4 Stars because I just purchased it today.  It was very simple to assemble, I didnt even need my husband for help.  We purchased this gate because of the great reviews and also because I have 2 70lbs Terriers that need to start getting used to being guarded off.  Although Im only 6 months pregnant I know this gate is going to work out great for our dogs when our baby is here.  We've had it up all day and the dogs jump on it with no problem.  The gate is sturdy comfy and attractive as well which is important in my house, most of all seems very safe. I highly recommend this product for all parent who have dogs in their house no matter what size they are.I would be giving it 5 stars if I had this gate longer,  but couldnt wait to post the great review after purchasing it and seeing how great my dogs are adapting to it.
This hands-free gate works when you step down on the foot paddle which causes a latch to open. You can then push the gate open with a hand or a knee. The gate is fairly easy to install (a necessary slim wrench is included in the box) and requires no screws or glue. The gate provides good protection. The bars on the gate are well-spaced so even small infants shouldn't be able to crawl through. When properly installed, it provides solid protection, although (important!) you should regularly check it to make sure it's securely affixed to the door frame. Also, over time the gate tends to bend a little, so you should use the little wrench-like tool to adjust it when necessary.In short, a very good gate for keeping kids out of a certain room. But this is *NOT* designed and should never be used to guard the top of a stairway.
So we had a little bit of an interesting situation. My husband and I were moving in to my parents' house after they built their house. We were preparing to live in the house about 1 year in advance, which is when I purchased this gate and installed it at my parents' house for when they had my daughter over there. It was barely used for the good part of that year, left open most of the time. Right before we moved in, my daughter ran into the gate (wasn't hurt, thank goodness) but it broke apart. Not only was the outside covered in plastic, the entire hinge was made of plastic! Are you kidding me? That much for a gate and you can't even give me a durable hinge? Sorry, but this was a waste of money!
We love this gate, we bought one to block of the top of the staircase, and we wanted a second one t block off the living area and the kitchen... unfortunately the coverage range of this product is very limited... even with the extensions.The gate overall is made out of solid material. The kickstand takes a bit of pressure to release, but it's good to have, because my son can't accidentally push it down and open the gate.The gate area is smaller than an average to walk through, but it's not too bad.Out of all the gates we have had we like the Hands Free gate the best. It would be the only gate we purchase only if it could a bigger area.
Product delivered on description.  Easy to use, install, and hands free.  It says it's not approved for use at the top of the stairs because the only gates approved for use at the top of the stairs are hardware mounted ones, so I just put it in the hallway right before the stairs and works great.  Although it's so sturdy, if there wasn't the rule about needing to be hardware mounted it would work for stairs.  I'm not sure how old the people's children are who said they can open this gate, but mine is 1 and there's no way he's strong enough.  In order to open the gate you have to have a good amount of leg strength that I wouldn't anticipate younger kids having.
We have a pretty wide door frame. About 32&#34;. This works well in the space.Cons: The foot pedal length will prevent you from closing the door. If it were shorter, I could still close the door and leave the gate up.It takes quite a bit of force to open it with the foot pedal. It makes a pretty loud sound when doing so, and so quietly  checking in on the baby is a challenge.It's not really hands free because as you enter, the gate swings very fast and so whatever is on the other side, like, the door, is going to get banged. Plus you need to use your hand to close it back or else your cat is going to take the opportunity to run in.
...in medical bills! Previously, we had a cheap wood, stationary gate in our hallway. I must have hefted my pregnant self and my 10 month old over that gate a hundred times a day and it was taking a serious toll on my back and knees. After about the 10th time I nearly fell over the darn thing, I went to find a new gate and saw this one. Next day I picked up at BRU (I had to get the extender peice too) and installed it.WONDERFUL. Sturdy, tall, nice to look at and it opens effortlessly. Couldn't be more thrilled. Everyone who has used it loves it because there is no fussing with latches or handgrips. Just step and nudge.
Not only is this gate incredibly easy to install and incredibly sturdy, but it is also great for pets.  We don't have any children, but we do have two dogs and two cats.  The dogs are constantly trying to get at the cats' food and litter box.This gate is actually a replacement for another gate we had to keep the dogs out, but it was flimsy and hard to maneuver around.  I just installed this gate in about 10 minutes and it's great because the cats can still have the run of the house by jumping it.  It also keeps our Black Lab from passing through.Buy this gate!  It's a wonderful, well thought-out product.
We love this gate, it is so easy to install.  I just got rid of our superyard gate.  That was not very good to use because you have to climb in and out of the gate.  If you have an active child like mine, you will have to go in and out a lot.  Several times i trip over it and it's not fun when you bang your legs into the gate.  It is plastic but still it hurts!  Since we just change to this hands free gate, we are so relieved.  It's worth every penny!
I purchased this gate at Babies R Us, but read the reviews first from Amazon.  I just purchased a toddler bed for my child and the gate is used to keep her in her bedroom at night.  The gate was so easy to put together and fits perfectly at the entrance of her bedroom door.  To open it, all you do is step on the foot pedal, which is needs weight to open.  The only problem I have now, is that my child closes the gate all the time.  When it's suppose to stay open.  Oh, well!!
We have two of these gates that we use to contain the babies (15 mo. and 4 mo.) IN the living room and to keep the dog OUT of the living room.  Easily installed and adjustable.  We haven't had to use any extensions.  15 mo. old can't open it but 6 yr. old nephew can operate it easily on his own.  We are buying a third one of these to keep the 15 mo. old out of the laundry room.  They are WONDERFUL!
I have researched every gate on the market at this point.  So far we are extremely happy with this gate.  We wanted pressure mounted gates but I was concerned that the opening of this particular gate would not be wide enough for my husband.  I thought that he would have to turn sideways to get through the door and would not like it once used on a regular basis.  So far we are very satisfied customers and my husband can walk straight through the opening so the width meets our needs better than I anticipated.
We got this gate because we recently got 2 puppies, and have gated off all areas of our house so that they don't run all around the house causing havoc. However regular gates are such a pain, having to step over them, is a hassle. Especially while trying to carry a new baby. So this is great. Only complaints: I wish the opening was larger, it isn't huge- but to be fair, the description does give dimensions. The only other thing that is taking a while to get used to, is there is a bar at the bottom of the gate- even in the opening, so you still have to watch your step, but it is less of a hassle than having to take down gates or step over them. overall, I would recommend.
I really really like this gate. My 19 year old grandson put it up for me as a means of keeping our dog limited to a certain area of our house, and to keep the grandkids in a more controlled area as well. It was easy to install and so far seems to be holding up very well. My only concern is whether it will last over time because we get so much traffic in our house and you do have to use a good bit of &#34;push&#34; to release and open the gate each time.  But overall, at this point, we love it!
We got this style because we didn't want to attach hardware to our door frames. The step is now noisy, which I may be able to fix with some WD40 or something, but I just haven't tried yet. We also have another gate that is a slightly different The First Years model than this. I like that that one has the plastic guard at the bottom to act as a transition. I've kicked the bottom bar while going through many times! The opening of this gate is also slightly narrower than the other gate. This one is also a little taller. Overall it does the job, but if I had to purchase again I would buy the other First Years model instead.
There are so many pros, so few cons to this gate.  It's tall, there's no way my 2-year-old can get over it.  Incredibly convenient swinging door.  If you follow the instructions on how to correctly tighten it on the door frame you won't have trouble.  I didn't do that the first time and I was getting frustrated.  The gate was smarter than me!My son, who is Mr. Motor Skills, cannot open it.Would make an excellent dog gate for small dogs.Sometimes the pedal can get sticky and you have to push on it a little harder, but that's really my only complaint.
This gate is really a great product. I love the fact that you don't have to hardware mount the gate (no drilling into the doorways required), and it's still very sturdy. It was incredibly easy to install, and is very safe and secure. My 18 month son knows how the gate opens, but cannot open it because of the weight required to push down on the lever. The only negatives I encountered were:1) The first Hands Free gate I purchased was not painted properly, so I had to return it for another one.2) I had to buy the 5&quot; gate extension for the gate to fit in the doorway. So, in the end, there are additional costs if the opening you intend to use the gate for is not that narrow. But all in all, it's totally worth it.
The gate is decent construction, and the lever has enough weight where only an adult can open it.  The mounts aren't sturdy.This gate only fits in our doorways, and this is with the extensions maxed-out to their maximum length.  This doesn't make for a secure fit in our doorways, and it is unusable anywhere else.  It's too small.  It fits soundly in doors less than 30&#34; in width, so measure your doorway before you buy.The mounts do not securely fasten onto the gate, so when you move it from doorway to doorway or when installing, these fall out of the gate, and you have to balance these during installation.Yes, there are extensions available, but these are sold as an accessory, and with the combined cost, there are other better options available.I don't recommend this product as we replaced it with a simpler, lower-cost solution. Save yourself.
I needed a gate for the top of the stairs, and searched Amazon for "baby gate top of stairs."  This gate is the second item returned.  Nowhere in the description does it say that this gate should not be used at the top of the stairs.  Of course as soon as we opened the box the instructions clearly say DO NOT USE AT THE TOP OF STAIRS.  The gate works great in the upstairs hallway, but we'll still need to buy a different gate at some point if we want the baby to have access to our room.
I was fortunate to find two of these gates with two extensions each at a second hand baby store for 20 dollars each.  After the first year with my newborn, I've come to need a coupe more gates.  I have tried 4 other similar ones and quickly sent them back.  These ones are a little more expensive, but I've found that after being spoiled with the foot opening contraption of these gates, I simply cannot live without that feature in another gate.  I do need the extensions, which makes it more expensive, so I will be purchasing two more of these in the very near future!!
Our little one is rolling and starting to crawl, so we bought two of these gates, one for the top of our walk-up stairs, and one for the hallway.  They are fantastic.  You have to do two things to open the gate -- push down on the foot pedal while pushing the gate forward, but because you can do these without your hands, it is perfect for when you are carrying your little one in your arms.  The foot pedal also requires a substantial push, so there is no way that the  baby (or a pet) would be able to do so on his or her own.  The material is very sturdy, so even if a toddler tried to pull herself up on the gate, it would not come undone.  The gate door also works both ways, an important feature.The one negative as far as I can tell is that when coming up the stairs, it takes a little extra coordination to step on the foot pedal.Definitely recommended.
I LOVE this gate and would buy it again. I like how it swings open both ways, opens with a foot pedal so it's hands free, and is incredibly sturdy though it's pressure-mounted. My ONLY disappointment with this gate is that it doesn't fit well on our stairs. We live in a small apartment and the wall doesn't jut out far enough from the bottom step in order for the foot pedal to work. Instead, I mounted the gate in the doorway of our baby's nursery, and it is working out GREAT.
I bought this because my older daughter had one just like it about 9 years ago. This clip is being used only when we go on car rides, so baby doesn't lose her pacifier. Well after about 4 months of occasional use the clip itself won't close all the way, so it doesn't secure to anything. Pacifier constantly falls onto the floor. Very disappointed as it's a cute design and it fit in her pacifier holder. Now its only purpose is to take up space in a landfill. Junk, do not buy!
I absolutely love this gate.  We were going to get two, but only got one to make sure we'd like it.  We didn't want to drill any holes and our gate sits at the bottom of the stairs just like in the pictures, only on the floor not the first step.  It's great.  All four points where the gate touches the wall are different depth and I also used the extension kit and it works perfectly.  It is very stable and my little boy can't open it or pull it down. I'm about to order another one for the top of the stairs.
Easy to use, easy to install and it has so many different options of installation (extensions, y-spindles, stairway adaptors) and all were easy to figure out. Even my 60 plus mother said it was easy to figure out how to use it without any instruction. Really liked how the bottom "supports" that press against the wall were flat on the bottom edge so they lay against the floor better. My other brand of gate didnt have that. Only complaint was my box had no directions in it. But managed without them.
We bought this gate a few months ago.  It's generally well made and is sturdier than some other gates.  Overall, it's a good choice, although in my opinion it is a bit overpriced.  An appropriate price for the quality would be around $50.PROS:-Adjustable size-Door swings both in both directions-Door is pretty easy to open-Pressure-mounted (no damage to walls)CONS:-You have to lift the door as you open it.  This gets to be a bit of a pain-Not as sturdy as a hardware-mounted gate... it loosens over time so you do need to take minute to tighten it up periodically.Other reviewers have commented that the bar across the bottom is annoying.  I actually find it to be fine.  You do have to step over it, but it's only about 1" so it doesn't bother me.I will update this review when my baby starts walking... I'm hoping that the pressure mount will be strong enough to hold up to a toddler!
We got this for a one step down into a den. Well, this gate has a metal plate across the bottom which becaome the cause of many trips, baby included. Also, the handle mechanism actually fell open/aprt. the first time, dh just screwed it back together. It did it a total of 4 times before we just took it down. THe opening is VERY NARROW. I have many scratches and bruises on hip from that gate. DH too. If you are REALLY skinny with no dh, okay, maybe. Also, when walking through, when you turn to close and push down, sometimes the plastic didn't go under the red tab, totally defeating the purpose of the gate
This gate is much better than most on the market. The design allows it to function well as a gate, yet allowing foot traffic through by the inclusion of a lockable door in the unit. The gate is made of metal, but I deducted 1 star due to the locking mechanism being made of plastic. Only time will tell how much real-world use it will stand up to. Another thing about this gate that I like is the flexibility offered by the availability of extensions -- it is possible to mount this gate pretty much anywhere needed. Overall, I am happy with this purchase.
I love watching my partner carry our baby in the Baby Bjorn,or "Bjorning the baby" as we call it, because poor Daddy is a real baby fumbler. The Baby Bjorn is simple to use, distributes the weight of baby evenly over both shoulders, and lulls the little one to sleep very easily.  I've seen Dad gain confidence taking charge of the little guy and strut proudly with the little one attatched to his belly. While Baby gets the benefit of being close to Daddy and getting a feel for Daddy's rhythm and hearing Daddy's voice up close, Mommy gets the benefit of a break once in a while! We used it at the State Fair this year and I can't begin to list its benefits over a sroller!  If you're debating between getting this or buying a sling, buy the Bjorn, and custom make your own sling (or find someone who does).  This is the best.
